1
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,517
What do you
call yourself, huh?

2
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,816
Antonio Montana.

3
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:44,985
And you, what you call yourself?

4
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,192
Where'd you
learn English, Tony?

5
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:48,398
In school.

6
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,780
And my father, he was
from the United States.

7
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,327
Just like you, you know?

8
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,617
He was a Yankee.

9
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,207
He used to take me
a lot to the movies.

10
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:00,375
I learned.

11
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:04,296
I watch the guys like Humphrey Bogart,
James Cagney.

12
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:09,672
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

13
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:13,301
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

14
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,953
So where's
your old man now?

15
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,135
He dead. He die.

16
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:19,432
Sometime. Somewhere.

17
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:20,603
Mother?

18
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,726
She dead, too.

19
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:23,502
What kind of
work you do in Cuba?

20
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:24,983
You know, things.

21
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,107
I was this, that.

22
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:30,568
Construction business.

23
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:34,319
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

24
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:36,198
Any family
in the States?

25
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,575
Cousins, brother-in-law, anybody?

26
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,783
Nobody.
Everybody's dead.

27
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:42,914
You ever been
to jail, Tony?

28
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:46,714
Me? Jail? No way, no.

29
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,212
Been in
a mental hospital?

30
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,419
Oh, yeah.
On the boat coming over.

31
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,885
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men, huh?

32
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:58,597
You like to dress up like a woman?

33
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,770
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

34
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:04,098
Just answer
the questions, Tony.

35
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,392
Okay. No.

36
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:08,644
Fuck, no.

37
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:12,527
Arrested
for vagrancy? Marijuana?

38
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,236
- Never, man.
- Heroin?

39
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,534
Cocaine?

40
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,781
No.

41
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,873
Where'd you get the beauty
scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

42
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:26,625
How am I gonna get a scar
like that eating pussy?

43
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,790
This was when I was a kid, you know?

44
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:30,884
Mmm-hmm.

45
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:34,087
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

46
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,387
And this?

47
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,674
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

48
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,475
Sweetheart, my ass!

49
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:42,268
We've been seeing more
and more of these.

50
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:45,014
Some kind of code
these guys used in the can.

51
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,600
Pitchfork means
an assassin or something.

52
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,185
You want to tell us about it,

53
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:52,237
or you want to take a trip
to the detention center?

54
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:56,279
Okay, you got me.

55
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:58,364
I was in the can one time.

56
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,286
For buying dollars.
Big deal.

57
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:01,496
That's pretty funny, Tony.

58
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:02,663
That's true.

59
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,582
It was a Canadian tourist.

60
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,911
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

61
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,121
Come on!

62
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,295
So I fuck up!

63
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:10,790
Let me talk to this guy.

64
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:12,715
Please! Let me talk
to him a minute.

65
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:14,134
You a Communist?

66
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:16,260
Huh?

67
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,422
How'd you like it?

68
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,052
They tell you always what to do,

69
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:22,385
what to think, what to feel.

70
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:23,935
Do you want to be like a sheep?

71
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:25,183
Like all those other people?

72
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:28,144
I don't have to listen to this!

73
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:30,021
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?

74
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:32,273
You own nothing, you got nothing!

75
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,732
Do you want a <i>chivato</i>
on every corner,

76
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,316
watching everything you do?

77
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,072
Everything you say, man?

78
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:41,904
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

79
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:44,365
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

80
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,793
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

81
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:49,873
How'd you like that?

82
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:53,082
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

83
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:56,544
I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no <i>puta</i> or thief.

84
00:06:56,763 --> 00:07:00,382
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

85
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,676
I want my fucking
human rights, now!

86
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,808
Like President
Jimmy Carter says. Okay?

87
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:11,017
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

88
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,110
What do you say?

89
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:13,902
I don't believe any of this shit!

90
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,729
They all sound alike to me.

91
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,190
That Castro is
shitting all over us.

92
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:21,197
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

93
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,287
Get him out of here.

94
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,371
You know something?

95
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,537
You can send me anywhere.

96
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,911
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

97
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,663
There's nothing you can do to me

98
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:29,994
that Castro hasn't done...

99
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:31,420
Get him out of here!

100
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,008
- So?
- So?

101
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:38,423
What'd you tell them?

102
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,470
What you told me to tell them.

103
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,264
That we...
I was in sanitation.

104
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:46,184
They didn't go for it.

105
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,431
Sanitation?

106
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,603
Yeah.

107
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:50,438
I told you to tell them

108
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:54,269
you was in a sanitarium,
not sanitation.

109
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,687
Sanitarium. Yeah.

110
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,147
You didn't tell me that.

111
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:03,157
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanitarium.

112
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:04,661
You was cured.

113
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:08,073
When did you tell me that?

114
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,311
You should've kept your mouth shut.

115
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,622
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

116
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,522
Tony! Montana!

117
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:17,643
Tony Montana!
Come here.

118
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:20,983
Come here, man.
I gotta talk to you.

119
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,156
Come on, man.
It's important.

120
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,197
- So close, man.
- Come on.

121
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,487
I gotta talk to you.

122
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:29,662
Where are you going?

123
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:30,785
Leave him alone.

124
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,991
I got better things to do.

125
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:34,292
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

126
00:09:34,378 --> 00:09:36,995
Are you ready for some good news?

127
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,213
Sure.
What you got, man?

128
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,383
We can be outta
this place in 30 days.

129
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:45,008
Not only that, but we got a green card
and a job in Miami.

130
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,381
Now are we made or
are we made, man?

131
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:50,930
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

132
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,556
No, man, somebody else.

133
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:53,683
You're kidding.

134
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,014
No.

135
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,314
You're not kidding?

136
00:09:57,652 --> 00:10:00,565
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

137
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:01,816
Rebenga?

138
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:04,030
I know that name.

139
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:05,323
Yeah?

140
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:06,991
- He's political.
- Yeah.

141
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,863
Well, he's coming in here today.
Castro just sprung him.

142
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:14,826
This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.

143
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:19,497
Castro felt he couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.

144
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:22,917
But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.

145
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,344
One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.

146
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,887
He wants the favor repaid.

147
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:29,761
That's where we come in.

148
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,681
It's ugly, man.

149
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,766
Yeah.

150
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,489
You tell your guys
in Miami, your friend,

151
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:47,824
it'd be a pleasure.

152
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,364
I'd kill a Communist for fun,

153
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:54,957
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

154
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:15,829
Rebenga!

155
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,495
From a friend you fucked!

156
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,062
That face.
That's nice.

157
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,487
That doesn't look like me.

158
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:37,319
That looks pretty, man.

159
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,034
Whoo!

160
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,066
Fuck!

161
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,400
What's wrong, man?

162
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,198
Your big shot friend better come up
with something soon.

163
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,871
I didn't come to the U.S.
to break my fucking back.

164
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:24,415
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

165
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:26,580
Fucking thing!

166
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,957
I told you.

167
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,877
What's wrong?

168
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:47,389
Look at that one.

169
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:50,021
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

170
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,897
Look at those titties.

171
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:54,400
Look at that punk with her.

172
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:56,990
What's he got that I don't have?

173
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:01,286
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

174
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,909
I mean, look at the way he dresses.

175
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:10,541
Come on. That's style,
flash, pizzazz.

176
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:13,669
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

177
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:19,179
Look at this.

178
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:21,639
Fucking onions.

179
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:27,312
They ought to be picking gold
from the street.

180
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:30,269
Oh, God, I can feel it.

181
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,148
There's two guys looking
for you out there.

182
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,398
That's him, man.
That's <i>El mono.</i> I told you.

183
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,199
Don't stay too fucking long.

184
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:42,694
We've got a lot of work to do.

185
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:04,340
Waldo!
Good to see you, man.

186
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:07,935
This is my friend Tony Montana
I've been telling you about.

187
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:11,390
Tony, that's Omar Suarez,
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.

188
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,274
I got something for you.

189
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,397
Yeah?
What do we gotta do?

190
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:16,610
Gotta unload a boat.

191
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:19,030
Marijuana. 45 tons.
You get 500 each.

192
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:22,276
500? That's great.

193
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:23,655
You gotta be kidding.

194
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:28,206
500?

195
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:32,035
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

196
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:37,124
The going rate on a boat
is 1,000 a night.

197
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:38,253
You know that.

198
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:41,177
First you gotta work
your way up to 500.

199
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:43,801
What I did for you in Freedom Town,
what was that?

200
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,053
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

201
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:47,185
That was something else.

202
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:48,718
Shut up!
Take it easy.

203
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,392
What's with this dishwasher, <i>chico?</i>

204
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:53,147
Don't he know we could've got

205
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,099
any space cadet to
hit Rebenga cheaper?

206
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,351
50 bucks!

207
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:57,561
Then why didn't you?

208
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:59,650
Don't call me no
fucking dishwasher,

209
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,072
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

210
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,862
Who the fuck are you?

211
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:05,573
You can't do that, man!

212
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:07,946
The Colombians!

213
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,244
Okay, all right, big man!

214
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,087
You want to make some big bucks?

215
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:17,914
Let's see how tough you are.

216
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:20,425
You know something about cocaine?

217
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,552
You kidding me or what?

218
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:30,427
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

219
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:31,894
New guys.

220
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,518
They say they got two keys
for us, for openers.

221
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,021
Pure coke.
Hotel in Miami Beach.

222
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:38,647
I want you to go over there.

223
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:41,146
If it's what they say,
pay them and bring it back.

224
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,318
Do that, you got 5 grand.

225
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:48,448
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

226
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,996
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

227
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:56,245
Yeah, man.
We were in the Army.

228
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,421
You gonna need a couple other guys.

229
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,964
That's no problem.

230
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:03,085
Be at Hector's bodega
at noon, Friday.

231
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:05,090
You get the buy money then.

232
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:11,393
If anything happens
to that buy money,

233
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:14,186
my boss will stick your
heads up your asses

234
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:16,476
faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

235
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:18,019
I'm scared.

236
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:22,855
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

237
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,071
That was dumb.

238
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:26,070
You worry too much.

239
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,617
You'll have a heart attack.

240
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:30,867
You act like that guy's doing
you a favor or something.

241
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:33,206
What's this with the Colombians?

242
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,908
What does it matter?

243
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,129
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

244
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:42,332
I don't like
fucking Colombians, okay?

245
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:45,005
What you guys doing?

246
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,178
There's a lot of
dishes to be washed.

247
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,009
Wash them yourself.

248
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:51,348
I retire!

249
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:53,893
What the fuck you gonna do now?

250
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,104
Don't come back here!

251
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:57,397
I gotta look after my investment!

252
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,436
Fuck you guys!

253
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:00,858
Close the shop!

254
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:19,248
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

255
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,336
Are you fucking crazy?

256
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:22,755
She's 103 years old.

257
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,507
Not that one, man!
That one!

258
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:26,594
Which one?

259
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:27,678
The young one.

260
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:30,509
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

261
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:36,761
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

262
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:39,389
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

263
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:41,850
Just play it cool.
Miami Beach.

264
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,936
Miami Beach, man!

265
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,918
The money stays in the trunk
till I come out.

266
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:10,628
You got it?
Me, nobody else. Okay.

267
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:14,758
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

268
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:16,642
Room 9. You ready?

269
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:18,264
Sure thing.

270
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:20,699
Okay. You mind
leaving the door open?

271
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,951
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

272
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:25,037
Sure. No problem.

273
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,672
No problem.

274
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:31,877
Hello. This is Marta.

275
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:37,674
Marta, hello.

276
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:41,928
I am Hector.

277
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:44,017
And I am Tony.

278
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:50,820
So, Omar says you're okay.

279
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:54,695
Yeah? Good.
Omar's okay.

280
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:56,947
Okay.

281
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:05,042
So, you got the money?

282
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,922
You got the stuff?

283
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,714
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

284
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:15,466
I got it close by.

285
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:22,093
I don't have the money either, man.

286
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:25,896
I have it close by, too.

287
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:29,059
Where?

288
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:32,065
In the car?

289
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,902
No, not in the car, man.

290
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:36,153
No?

291
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,823
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

292
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:43,582
Not far.

293
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:54,793
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

294
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,137
Where you from, Tony?

295
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,554
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

296
00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:04,435
Take it easy, man.

297
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:08,765
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

298
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,445
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

299
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:15,105
Okay?

300
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,273
- What's the story?
- Tony!

301
00:23:26,877 --> 00:23:30,996
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

302
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:32,922
You steal from me, you're dead.

303
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:34,215
Yeah?

304
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:41,131
You want to give me the cash,

305
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,683
or do I kill your brother first

306
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,136
before I kill you?

307
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:52,563
Why don't you try sticking
your head up your ass?

308
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:54,894
See if it fits.

309
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:59,023
Yeah? Okay.

310
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:24,098
<i>Yeah, it's very important.</i>

311
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:25,703
<i>I understand it's important.</i>

312
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:27,447
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

313
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:29,214
<i>You forecasted an earthquake</i>

314
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:31,764
<i>in the 3-to-4-point
range this morning.</i>

315
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:35,060
<i>We had an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

316
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:36,195
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

317
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,360
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

318
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:40,698
<i>However, isn't it
rather slender evidence...</i>

319
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:53,752
You have such beautiful skin.

320
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,212
I like the way you...

321
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:04,889
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

322
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,531
Antonio, <i>mira!</i>

323
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,576
Watch what happens to your friend.

324
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:35,749
If you don't want this
to happen to you,

325
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:37,417
give me the money.

326
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:57,687
Come on, come on.

327
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:10,617
Now the leg, huh.

328
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,465
Let's do it, man.
Come on.

329
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:33,094
We're all gonna be all right.

330
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:46,149
Okay, <i>cara cicatriz.</i>

331
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:49,285
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

332
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:58,327
Last chance, <i>pendejo!</i>

333
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:00,337
Fuck you!

334
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,533
You okay?

335
00:28:09,617 --> 00:28:11,074
Yeah, man.
It went in and out.

336
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:24,414
Okay, take him
out of here, quick!

337
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,415
Chi Chi! Get the <i>yeyo.</i>

338
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,981
Your turn.

339
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:51,282
I kill you!

340
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:52,618
Die!

341
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:09,921
Hurry up! Get in!
Come on. Let's go!

342
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:11,760
Close the door!

343
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:27,602
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

344
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:30,424
<i>Yeah, well,
I'll check it out right away.</i>

345
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:34,613
You do that, Omar.
You do that.

346
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,242
<i>You still got the money?</i>

347
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:37,445
Yeah.

348
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:40,456
And I got the <i>yeyo.</i>

349
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:42,412
<i>You got the</i> yeyo?

350
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:43,709
Yeah, right.

351
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:45,212
<i>Bring it here.</i>

352
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:46,296
Fuck you.

353
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:48,794
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

354
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:51,170
Not you, me.

355
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:11,361
Nice fucking guy.

356
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:27,495
Frank Lopez.
Tony Montana.

357
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:29,000
Tony Montana.

358
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,922
Mr. Lopez.
It's a real pleasure.

359
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,336
You can call me Frank.

360
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:35,044
Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team,

361
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:37,713
even the fucking
prosecutors around town,

362
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:38,965
they all call me Frank.

363
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:40,720
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

364
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:42,764
Manny Ribera.

365
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:44,303
He caught one on the job.

366
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:45,513
Went right through.

367
00:30:45,607 --> 00:30:47,189
We heard about that.

368
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,518
Omar, he tells me great
things about you guys.

369
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:53,859
Well, Omar's okay.

370
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:57,112
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

371
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:59,235
That Commie son of a bitch...

372
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,865
You don't have to mention that.

373
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:02,787
That was fun.

374
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:03,990
That was fun?

375
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,324
Damn right.

376
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:06,579
That was fun.

377
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:09,708
Sometimes it's fun.

378
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:12,210
What do you want to drink?

379
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,660
Scotch, gin, rum?
What do you like?

380
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,878
Gin is fine.
Want some? Two gins.

381
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:20,222
I need a guy with
steel in his balls, Tony.

382
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:23,847
A guy like you. And I need
him around me all the time.

383
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:27,305
You, Tony, and your <i>compadre</i> here.

384
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:31,942
Here's the stuff.

385
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,772
Two keys.

386
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:40,784
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

387
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:43,825
My gift to you.

388
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,753
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

389
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:54,089
If people would do
business the right way,

390
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:56,792
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

391
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:01,463
Don't think I don't
appreciate the gesture.

392
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,467
You're gonna find,
you stay loyal in this business,

393
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:07,936
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

394
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:17,278
And you'll find out
your biggest problem

395
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:19,322
is not bringing in the stuff,

396
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,407
but what to do with
all the fucking cash!

397
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:25,116
I hope I have that problem someday.

398
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:27,038
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

399
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,123
Sit down over here.

400
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:33,249
Where the hell's Elvira?

401
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,251
It's late.
Go find her, will you?

402
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:38,254
Jesus! Fucking broad.

403
00:32:38,344 --> 00:32:42,805
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

404
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,175
Gotta get her in between.

405
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:48,010
She's coming.

406
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:49,185
Yeah.

407
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,977
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

408
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:54,023
That's the best time.

409
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:58,521
What are you guys doing tonight?

410
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:01,740
You wanna go to a nice restaurant with me?
You hungry?

411
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:03,951
I could eat a horse.

412
00:33:04,037 --> 00:33:05,778
Okay, they'll cook you a horse.

413
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:07,079
I'll eat it.

414
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,333
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

415
00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:17,790
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

416
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:18,920
It hit the wall.

417
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:21,294
I ran out of bullets,
like an asshole.

418
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:24,846
When I changed the clip,
a guy who I thought I killed

419
00:33:24,932 --> 00:33:27,094
wasn't dead and shot me.

420
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:29,593
The guy was behind me.
I killed him.

421
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:30,936
How many bullets you catch?

422
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:32,138
Bullets? One bullet.

423
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:33,517
9mm.

424
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,530
Elvira,
where the hell you been?

425
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:48,032
It's 10:00.
I'm starving.

426
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:51,411
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

427
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:54,080
Where you going?
Come on.

428
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:58,547
Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

429
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:03,260
Tony Montana. Elvira.

430
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:06,547
Hello.

431
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:07,973
Manny Ribera. Elvira.

432
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:10,350
So, there are five of us.

433
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:11,847
Where are we having dinner?

434
00:34:11,938 --> 00:34:14,430
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

435
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:16,473
- Again?
- Again.

436
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:19,943
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted
to assassinate you,

437
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:22,271
you wouldn't be too hard to find.

438
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:25,529
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

439
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,612
I got nothing but friends!

440
00:34:29,747 --> 00:34:31,534
You never know.

441
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:33,616
Maybe the catcher on
your Little League team.

442
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,460
The catcher?
That son of a bitch,

443
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:37,957
he didn't get
a base hit all season.

444
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,458
I should kill him!

445
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:49,613
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

446
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:54,621
They got the biggest distribution setup
from here to Houston,

447
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:56,994
Tucson, all down that way.

448
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:58,867
What do you think of that, huh?

449
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:01,999
Look.

450
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,634
You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.

451
00:36:07,804 --> 00:36:09,716
<i>El Gordo!</i>

452
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:12,674
He's got more cash than
anybody in this place.

453
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:15,347
He's a real <i>chazer!</i>

454
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,148
You know what a <i>chazer</i> is?

455
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,814
No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a <i>chazer?</i>

456
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:27,487
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

457
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:30,611
A guy who wants more than he needs.

458
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:32,317
He don't fly straight no more.

459
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:34,994
So, it comes down to one thing,

460
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:37,824
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

461
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,998
Lesson Number 1:

462
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:46,256
Don't underestimate

463
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:48,751
the other guy's greed!

464
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,424
Lesson Number 2:

465
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:53,593
Don't get high on your own supply.

466
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,057
That's right.
Lesson Number 2:

467
00:36:56,143 --> 00:36:57,930
Don't get high on your own supply.

468
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,600
Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

469
00:37:06,112 --> 00:37:08,024
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

470
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:09,446
That is '64?

471
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:10,864
The best, Mr. Lopez.

472
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,532
Omar, you pour it, and you bring

473
00:37:12,618 --> 00:37:14,405
another bottle
right away, will you?

474
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,036
Pleasure, Mr. Lopez.

475
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:21,747
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

476
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:22,959
That's pretty good.

477
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:25,458
For a bunch of fucking grapes.

478
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:32,132
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

479
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,812
How you like it, Tony?

480
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,645
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

481
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:46,976
Like you say, man.

482
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,276
That's good!

483
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,233
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

484
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:57,286
I'm gonna get you $550 suits,

485
00:37:57,997 --> 00:37:59,829
so you look real sharp.

486
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,999
'Cause I want you to work for me.

487
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:08,498
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

488
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:14,594
We are going to do something
big next month.

489
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:19,429
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

490
00:38:19,852 --> 00:38:23,436
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

491
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,816
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

492
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,520
You want a cigar?

493
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:35,949
You wanna dance, Frank,

494
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:38,778
or sit here and
have a heart attack?

495
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:47,871
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

496
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:52,173
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

497
00:38:58,516 --> 00:38:59,723
How about you?

498
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:06,145
What?
You want me to dance?

499
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:08,224
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony.
You dance.

500
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:11,480
Go on.
Have some fun.

501
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,165
What do you think of him?

502
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,536
I think he's a fucking peasant!

503
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,588
But you get a guy
like that on your side,

504
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:38,382
he breaks his back for you.

505
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,496
What's your name?

506
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:09,622
What?

507
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:13,413
What's your name?
Elvira what?

508
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:14,707
Hancock.

509
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,881
What?

510
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:17,251
Hancock!

511
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:18,551
Hancock?

512
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:23,215
Sounds like a bird.
Hancock.

513
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,050
Flying around.

514
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:28,478
Where you from?

515
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,396
Baltimore.

516
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:31,483
What?

517
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,482
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

518
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:34,986
Where's that?

519
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:37,737
It doesn't really matter, okay?

520
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:41,491
I'm just trying to be friendly.

521
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,827
I don't need another friend,

522
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,246
especially one who just
got off a banana boat.

523
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,574
Banana boat?

524
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:51,459
Hold it.
You got the wrong guy.

525
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:53,411
I don't come off no banana boat.

526
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:57,499
You're thinking
of someone else, maybe.

527
00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:00,010
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

528
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:04,472
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

529
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:06,219
So take it easy.
Don't talk crazy.

530
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,596
Sorry.

531
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:11,180
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

532
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:14,016
What is your problem, baby?

533
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:15,354
You're good-looking.

534
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,523
You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs,

535
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:20,113
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

536
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,690
Only you got a look in your eye

537
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:24,489
like you haven't been
fucked in a year!

538
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:27,070
Hey, José.

539
00:41:27,164 --> 00:41:30,453
Who, why, when and how I fuck is
none of your business, okay?

540
00:41:30,543 --> 00:41:31,954
Now you're talking to me, baby.

541
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:33,785
That I like.
Keep it coming.

542
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:36,997
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

543
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:40,208
Not yet, but you gotta
give me some time.

544
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,889
Even if I were blind, desperate,

545
00:41:45,975 --> 00:41:48,308
starved and begging for it
on a desert island,

546
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:50,727
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

547
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:56,065
That chick he's with...

548
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,317
- Yeah?
- ...she likes me.

549
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:03,406
She likes you?
How do you know?

550
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:04,903
I know.

551
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,534
The eyes, <i>chico.</i>
They never lie.

552
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:15,119
Are you serious?

553
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:16,919
Serious?
What do you think?

554
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:19,502
That's the boss's lady, okay?

555
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:20,673
You're gonna get us killed.

556
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:23,877
Fuck you, man.
The boss's lady.

557
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,592
That guy's soft.

558
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:30,224
Look in his face.

559
00:42:33,189 --> 00:42:35,897
The booze and the <i>concha</i>
tell him what to do.

560
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:40,860
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

561
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,362
Just remember last year
at this time

562
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:45,611
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

563
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,109
You remember.

564
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,907
I'd like to forget that.

565
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:52,743
I say be happy with what you got.

566
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:54,199
You be happy.

567
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:57,543
Me, I want what's coming to me.

568
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,121
What's coming to you?

569
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,757
The world, <i>chico,</i>

570
00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:07,133
and everything in it.

571
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:09,722
Oh, man.

572
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:44,294
This is paradise.

573
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,090
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

574
00:43:48,347 --> 00:43:52,842
This town's like a great big
pussy just waiting to get fucked.

575
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:56,769
I should've come here 10 years ago.

576
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:59,689
I'd have been a millionaire
by this time.

577
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:03,686
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat,

578
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:06,192
my own car, my own golf course.

579
00:44:06,282 --> 00:44:09,195
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

580
00:44:09,326 --> 00:44:10,942
A line of blue jeans.

581
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:14,200
With my name written
on the back of chicks' asses.

582
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:16,994
How's that?

583
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,123
That sounds completely crazy to me.

584
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:23,205
Look at that. Look.

585
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:25,965
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.

586
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:27,337
We're missing the action.

587
00:44:30,472 --> 00:44:32,964
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

588
00:44:33,058 --> 00:44:34,890
Get lost, greaseball!

589
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,727
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?

590
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,562
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

591
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,690
Girls like ice cream.

592
00:44:40,774 --> 00:44:42,891
Oh, come on.
That won't work.

593
00:44:42,985 --> 00:44:44,897
You can't do it that way.

594
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:47,897
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

595
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,947
What was that?
What you just did?

596
00:44:54,038 --> 00:44:55,245
That's what you do.

597
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:57,117
That's disgusting.

598
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:58,207
Watch.

599
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,084
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

600
00:45:01,211 --> 00:45:03,419
Like a bug coming
out of your mouth.

601
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:06,498
Figures you wouldn't understand.

602
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:07,753
But the women in this country,

603
00:45:07,843 --> 00:45:09,835
when you do that, they know.

604
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:10,928
They know what?

605
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:12,883
They understand.
They go crazy.

606
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,349
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

607
00:45:16,435 --> 00:45:18,597
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

608
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:19,928
Look at that.

609
00:45:25,611 --> 00:45:27,193
She's looking at us.

610
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:32,282
You think you can do it with her?

611
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:33,575
I think I can.

612
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:35,193
You want to try it with her?

613
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:36,448
Why not?

614
00:45:37,623 --> 00:45:39,159
You gonna watch me?

615
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:40,956
I'm looking at you.
Go ahead.

616
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:42,701
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

617
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:45,582
I'm with you, man.

618
00:45:46,298 --> 00:45:47,755
I'm gonna get her.

619
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,052
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.

620
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:54,616
Just be quiet.
Just hang back.

621
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,926
Romeo!

622
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:03,892
You're looking very pretty today.

623
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,473
Yes, you.
I've been watching you.

624
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:07,730
You want to see something funny?

625
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,982
Take a look over there.
See that man?

626
00:46:10,155 --> 00:46:12,488
Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.

627
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:13,899
I gotta watch my friend.

628
00:46:13,992 --> 00:46:16,655
He gonna stick his
tongue out to that girl.

629
00:46:16,787 --> 00:46:18,153
Oh, look at that.

630
00:46:19,164 --> 00:46:20,245
You're sick!

631
00:46:20,332 --> 00:46:22,574
You see what happened to him?

632
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:24,913
If I wasn't a nice guy...

633
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:26,619
She's too big for you.

634
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:28,667
Causing trouble like that, come on.

635
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:31,170
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?

636
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:32,667
What I try to tell you?

637
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:35,671
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

638
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:39,933
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

639
00:46:40,018 --> 00:46:43,182
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

640
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:46,098
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

641
00:46:46,191 --> 00:46:47,853
That's the one I rented.

642
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:52,191
No. That's her, man.
There she is.

643
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:53,859
About time.

644
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,283
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

645
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:58,951
He told me to pick you up.

646
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:02,204
He said he'd meet us
at the track later.

647
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,499
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

648
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:13,337
In that thing?
You must be kidding.

649
00:47:15,053 --> 00:47:18,171
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

650
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:21,884
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

651
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:23,058
Oh, come on.

652
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:28,523
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

653
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:31,693
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

654
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:43,533
So, you like this better?

655
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,407
Yeah.

656
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,751
It's like one of them
tigers from India.

657
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:50,999
Tigers, huh?
Tigers, no?

658
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:53,001
Crazy guy. Know what
he's been doing?

659
00:47:53,091 --> 00:47:55,925
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

660
00:47:56,178 --> 00:47:57,760
He says he's gonna buy one.

661
00:47:57,888 --> 00:48:00,426
You do that and you won't have
any friends left.

662
00:48:00,516 --> 00:48:01,848
Not that you have any now.

663
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:03,675
You're gonna like that tiger, man.

664
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:06,682
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

665
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:09,264
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.

666
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:13,855
How much?

667
00:48:13,946 --> 00:48:15,437
43,000, fully equipped.

668
00:48:15,531 --> 00:48:17,147
That all?

669
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:18,948
Machine-gun turrets are extra.

670
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:22,110
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.

671
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:26,452
Bulletproof this, okay?

672
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,625
And this here and here.

673
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:31,148
- Okay.
- And the windows.

674
00:48:33,632 --> 00:48:36,875
Get me a phone with a scrambler.

675
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:38,210
A scrambler.

676
00:48:38,303 --> 00:48:40,795
And a radio with scanners

677
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,881
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

678
00:48:42,975 --> 00:48:44,637
Don't forget the fog lights.

679
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:48,640
Oh. In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

680
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:54,726
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

681
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:58,487
I thought you were
taking me to Frank.

682
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:06,613
We got an hour.
You hungry?

683
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,120
No, but I'm bored.

684
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:12,831
Well, that figures.

685
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,296
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

686
00:49:18,594 --> 00:49:21,803
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

687
00:49:21,972 --> 00:49:23,772
- Good doing business with you.
- Mr. Montana.

688
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:26,515
Oh, God, man!

689
00:49:29,104 --> 00:49:31,517
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

690
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:34,350
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

691
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:36,692
Oh, yeah.
You know who?

692
00:49:38,822 --> 00:49:40,609
What would Frank say?

693
00:49:42,993 --> 00:49:44,700
I like Frank, you know?

694
00:49:45,203 --> 00:49:47,035
Only I like you better.

695
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,041
You got some for me?

696
00:49:56,131 --> 00:49:57,212
Sure.

697
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,051
Okay.

698
00:50:12,564 --> 00:50:13,680
Okay.

699
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:18,142
Don't get confused, Tony.

700
00:50:18,236 --> 00:50:20,319
I don't fuck around with the help.

701
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:31,706
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

702
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,040
Shit.

703
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:35,410
Would you kiss me
if I wear the hat?

704
00:50:35,504 --> 00:50:36,585
No!

705
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,206
Playtime is over, okay?

706
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:44,878
Okay.

707
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:39,561
Mama?

708
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:42,560
Antonio.

709
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:44,145
Long time.

710
00:51:46,992 --> 00:51:48,733
No postcards from jail, huh?

711
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:00,749
Gina.

712
00:52:02,507 --> 00:52:03,918
Tony?

713
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:05,341
Look at you.

714
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:08,798
You're beautiful.

715
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:10,514
I didn't...

716
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,261
Mama, look at those eyes, huh.

717
00:52:12,517 --> 00:52:14,099
Look at that.
She looks like me.

718
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:18,347
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

719
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,933
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

720
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:28,189
I got something for you.

721
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,162
It's no big deal.

722
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,167
Oh, Tony!

723
00:52:49,805 --> 00:52:52,047
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

724
00:52:52,182 --> 00:52:54,299
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

725
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:55,883
Well, no.

726
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,852
You look so good.

727
00:53:01,942 --> 00:53:05,151
Look, open that up.
Open it.

728
00:53:05,821 --> 00:53:06,937
For me?

729
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,066
I think so.

730
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:12,692
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

731
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:19,157
See what's written on the back?

732
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:21,538
On the back? Aw.

733
00:53:22,504 --> 00:53:23,504
Always.

734
00:53:23,588 --> 00:53:26,422
"Always."
It's beautiful, Tony!

735
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:30,092
Mama is still working
in the factory,

736
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,337
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

737
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,514
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

738
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:38,510
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

739
00:53:38,603 --> 00:53:41,220
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

740
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:44,436
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

741
00:53:44,526 --> 00:53:46,392
Then I'll be making enough money...

742
00:53:46,486 --> 00:53:47,772
Surprise!

743
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:51,113
All that's over, starting today.

744
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:52,611
Why?

745
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:54,533
My kid sister don't have to work

746
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:57,362
in no beauty parlor, and Mama,

747
00:53:57,956 --> 00:54:00,414
she don't have to
sew in no factory.

748
00:54:00,709 --> 00:54:02,792
Your son made it, Mama.

749
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:05,586
He's a success.

750
00:54:06,756 --> 00:54:09,123
That's why I didn't
come around before.

751
00:54:10,093 --> 00:54:13,962
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

752
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:17,890
Here's $1,000.

753
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:20,100
For you, Mama.

754
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:29,401
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

755
00:54:29,487 --> 00:54:30,603
Mama.

756
00:54:30,989 --> 00:54:32,946
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

757
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:34,990
- No?
- No.

758
00:54:35,994 --> 00:54:37,986
What are you doing now?

759
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,664
Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

760
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,992
No! Things are different now.

761
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:46,919
I'm working with
an anti-Castro group.

762
00:54:47,297 --> 00:54:48,913
I'm an organizer now.

763
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:51,294
I get a lot of
political contributions.

764
00:54:52,344 --> 00:54:53,835
Sure you do.

765
00:54:58,183 --> 00:55:01,267
A gun sticking
in somebody's face is how.

766
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:05,889
You know, all we hear about
in the papers

767
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:10,693
is animals like you
and the killings.

768
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:14,693
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people,

769
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:16,445
people who come here, work hard

770
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:18,116
and make a good name
for themselves.

771
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:20,160
People who send
their children to school.

772
00:55:20,246 --> 00:55:21,953
What are you saying?
That's your son...

773
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,124
Son? I wish I had one.

774
00:55:25,961 --> 00:55:26,961
- He's a bum.
- No.

775
00:55:27,087 --> 00:55:29,921
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

776
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:33,712
Who do you think you are?

777
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:35,710
Mmm?

778
00:55:36,262 --> 00:55:39,221
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

779
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:45,018
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around

780
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:47,563
and think you can get my respect.

781
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:50,892
You think you can
buy me with jewelry?

782
00:55:50,986 --> 00:55:54,570
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes

783
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:57,148
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

784
00:55:57,242 --> 00:55:59,154
You don't know what you're saying.

785
00:55:59,244 --> 00:56:01,406
That's not the way I am, Antonio!

786
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:04,071
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

787
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:08,664
You are not going to destroy her.

788
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:12,079
I don't need your money.

789
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:16,007
I work for my living.

790
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:19,132
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

791
00:56:19,597 --> 00:56:21,589
I don't want you around Gina.

792
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:25,183
So come on.
Get out!

793
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,359
Okay.

794
00:56:35,864 --> 00:56:36,980
Mama...

795
00:56:37,073 --> 00:56:41,067
And take this lousy money
with you. It stinks.

796
00:56:41,327 --> 00:56:42,443
Tony.

797
00:56:43,788 --> 00:56:46,622
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody, huh?

798
00:56:49,294 --> 00:56:50,956
I'm sorry, Tony.

799
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:54,038
Okay, Mama.

800
00:56:58,344 --> 00:56:59,835
No. Tony, wait a minute!

801
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:01,007
Don't go, please!

802
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:02,133
Gina, stay here!

803
00:57:02,348 --> 00:57:03,384
No, Mama.

804
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:04,475
He's no good. Gina!

805
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,642
Tony, wait, please!

806
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:10,346
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

807
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,682
Mama, ever since
Papa left, she's...

808
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:14,979
Forget Papa.
We never had one.

809
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:17,691
I know you did
some bad things back then.

810
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:20,652
In the Army, I know you got
into some trouble.

811
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:22,483
The Communists,

812
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:24,660
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

813
00:57:24,746 --> 00:57:26,282
Mama doesn't understand that.

814
00:57:26,372 --> 00:57:27,579
I know.

815
00:57:29,209 --> 00:57:31,792
I just...
I don't know.

816
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:34,495
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

817
00:57:34,756 --> 00:57:36,042
It doesn't matter to me how long

818
00:57:36,132 --> 00:57:38,670
you've been away,
five or ten years.

819
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,929
You're my blood, always.

820
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:47,679
I know.

821
00:57:56,778 --> 00:57:58,770
Come on.
I want you to take this.

822
00:57:58,863 --> 00:57:59,944
I gotta go back in.

823
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:01,314
No, Tony. Please.

824
00:58:01,407 --> 00:58:02,773
You need this.

825
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:04,199
What will I tell her?

826
00:58:04,285 --> 00:58:06,026
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

827
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:07,453
Don't tell her I gave it to you,

828
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:09,656
but give her some
from time to time.

829
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:12,366
And listen, you go out yourself.

830
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,874
Go ahead. Go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

831
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:18,209
You gotta get some fun out of life.

832
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:21,133
You gonna beat yourself
to death at 19?

833
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:23,711
A pussycat like you?
Come here.

834
00:58:28,143 --> 00:58:30,009
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

835
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:32,220
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

836
00:58:32,313 --> 00:58:33,804
I'll talk to her.

837
00:58:35,733 --> 00:58:37,144
- I'll talk to you.
- Okay.

838
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:40,360
Let's go.

839
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:43,651
She's beautiful.
How come you...

840
00:58:43,741 --> 00:58:44,982
Hey!

841
00:58:47,453 --> 00:58:51,493
Stay away from her.
You hear?

842
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:53,828
She's not for you.

843
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:54,954
Okay.

844
00:59:20,445 --> 00:59:22,232
So, this and my other factory,

845
00:59:22,322 --> 00:59:23,529
I can guarantee production

846
00:59:23,615 --> 00:59:27,700
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

847
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:30,361
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

848
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:33,869
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States

849
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:36,166
who can share the risk with me,

850
00:59:36,252 --> 00:59:37,368
somebody who can guarantee

851
00:59:37,462 --> 00:59:41,627
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

852
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:46,385
Oh, that's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

853
00:59:47,472 --> 00:59:49,805
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

854
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:51,803
It would've been nice if he'd come.

855
00:59:51,893 --> 00:59:52,974
He would like to come,

856
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:55,223
but with his trial coming up,

857
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:57,646
it's hard to leave the country.

858
00:59:57,732 --> 00:59:59,564
So he sent you instead?

859
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:01,142
Something like that.

860
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:03,478
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

861
01:00:04,113 --> 01:00:07,481
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

862
01:00:29,347 --> 01:00:33,091
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me

863
01:00:33,184 --> 01:00:34,516
every month of the year.

864
01:00:34,602 --> 01:00:35,763
He picks it up here.

865
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:38,140
I can sell it to him
for as little as

866
01:00:40,024 --> 01:00:43,517
7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

867
01:00:44,362 --> 01:00:47,196
But then we got to take
the risk of moving it.

868
01:00:47,365 --> 01:00:50,358
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

869
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:52,363
That means we have to
go to war with them.

870
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:56,037
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

871
01:00:56,124 --> 01:00:57,990
Why don't we split the risk?

872
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:03,208
You guarantee your delivery, say,
as far as Panama,

873
01:01:04,048 --> 01:01:05,789
we take it from there.

874
01:01:08,136 --> 01:01:11,550
Panama is risky.
It costs me more.

875
01:01:13,224 --> 01:01:17,468
Panama I can sell for 13.5 a key.

876
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,222
13.5?
What, are you nuts?

877
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:26,478
13.5? We still got to
take that shit to Florida.

878
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:28,654
Do you know what
that's like these days?

879
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,857
You got the Navy everywhere.

880
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:32,991
You got frogmen.

881
01:01:33,077 --> 01:01:35,364
You got EC2s with
the satellite-tracking shit.

882
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:39,240
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

883
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:42,243
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

884
01:01:43,212 --> 01:01:46,080
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

885
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:47,752
Forget about 13.5.

886
01:01:51,346 --> 01:01:54,089
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

887
01:01:59,687 --> 01:02:01,724
Excuse me.
One moment.

888
01:02:06,194 --> 01:02:08,527
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

889
01:02:08,613 --> 01:02:10,275
Are you negotiating
for Frank Lopez?

890
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:12,607
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.

891
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,738
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

892
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:19,121
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

893
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:20,784
We're doing this
one deal. That's it.

894
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,783
Fuck you.
How's that?

895
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:25,702
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

896
01:02:25,797 --> 01:02:28,540
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

897
01:02:28,633 --> 01:02:30,090
That's it.
Let it go at that.

898
01:02:30,176 --> 01:02:31,542
Don't worry about it.

899
01:02:31,636 --> 01:02:33,593
Your head's in the wrong place.

900
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:34,965
You must watch out for yourself.

901
01:02:35,056 --> 01:02:36,217
Why not talk to him?

902
01:02:36,307 --> 01:02:38,299
You think he wants
to give you the money?

903
01:02:38,393 --> 01:02:39,804
Shut the fuck up.

904
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:41,973
I'm doing
the talking here, not you.

905
01:02:42,814 --> 01:02:45,477
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

906
01:02:46,943 --> 01:02:48,900
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

907
01:02:48,986 --> 01:02:50,506
That's easier to watch.

908
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:51,982
Close your mouth.

909
01:02:52,323 --> 01:02:55,612
I can't wait to see what
Frank's gonna react to this one.

910
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,777
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.

911
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:01,238
Now where were we?

912
01:03:01,332 --> 01:03:02,493
Panama.

913
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:05,167
You're looking for a partner, right?

914
01:03:06,546 --> 01:03:08,082
Something like that.

915
01:03:08,172 --> 01:03:11,665
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

916
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:16,883
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

917
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:19,093
That's my limit.
I got no right.

918
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:20,452
Nobody got no right to negotiate...

919
01:03:20,476 --> 01:03:22,263
Let the man finish, okay?

920
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:25,061
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

921
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:27,146
You got no authority here.

922
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:30,021
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

923
01:03:30,153 --> 01:03:32,566
Frank is gonna love it.

924
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:34,146
That's up to Frank, not you!

925
01:03:37,702 --> 01:03:39,739
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

926
01:03:40,204 --> 01:03:41,740
No, it is all right.

927
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:45,540
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

928
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:49,537
Well, good.

929
01:03:50,882 --> 01:03:54,046
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

930
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:57,302
But as soon as I get back to Miami,

931
01:03:57,388 --> 01:03:59,220
I will talk to Frank personally.

932
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:01,391
Good.

933
01:04:02,185 --> 01:04:04,552
My associates can
escort you to my chopper

934
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:06,349
to take you to Santa Cruz.

935
01:04:06,439 --> 01:04:09,523
I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.

936
01:04:09,609 --> 01:04:12,602
You'll be back here
tomorrow in time for lunch.

937
01:04:14,238 --> 01:04:15,649
Good.

938
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:20,734
Good talking to you.

939
01:04:21,787 --> 01:04:23,904
Why not leave your friend here?

940
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,783
While you're gone,
he can tell me how to run my business.

941
01:04:26,918 --> 01:04:28,580
I think Frank wants to see him.

942
01:04:28,669 --> 01:04:29,955
No, that's okay.

943
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:33,751
You tell Frank I'm keeping
this guy on ice for him.

944
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:38,047
I guess so.

945
01:04:41,307 --> 01:04:43,139
Let's finish our lunch.

946
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:49,855
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

947
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:53,476
You got everything
a man could want.

948
01:04:55,446 --> 01:04:58,234
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

949
01:04:59,825 --> 01:05:01,612
Unfortunately,
I don't feel the same

950
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:03,989
about the rest of
your organization.

951
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:09,784
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

952
01:05:10,461 --> 01:05:12,874
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

953
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:19,084
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch

954
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:22,421
from several years ago in New York.

955
01:05:26,727 --> 01:05:28,844
He was an informer for the police.

956
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:50,996
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

957
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,424
So how do I know
you're not a <i>chivato,</i> too, Tony?

958
01:06:01,846 --> 01:06:02,846
Hey, Sosa.

959
01:06:05,474 --> 01:06:07,716
Let's get this straight now.

960
01:06:09,437 --> 01:06:13,602
I've never fucked anybody
over who didn't have it coming.

961
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:15,224
You got that?

962
01:06:16,193 --> 01:06:19,982
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

963
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:23,482
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

964
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:27,236
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him,

965
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,821
I never trusted him.

966
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,032
For all I know, he had me set up

967
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,492
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

968
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:35,999
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

969
01:06:36,088 --> 01:06:38,455
You want to go on with me, say it.

970
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:41,292
You don't, then you make a move.

971
01:06:46,974 --> 01:06:49,637
I think you speak
from the heart, Montana.

972
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,138
But I say to myself,

973
01:06:52,229 --> 01:06:54,221
"This Lopez, your boss,

974
01:06:55,274 --> 01:06:58,142
"he had <i>chivatos</i>
like that working for him."

975
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:00,686
His judgment stinks.

976
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:05,191
So I think to myself,

977
01:07:05,618 --> 01:07:08,611
"How many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

978
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,000
"How can I trust his organization?"
You tell me, Tony.

979
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:20,206
Frank is smart, you know?

980
01:07:22,677 --> 01:07:24,919
You can't blame him for that animal.

981
01:07:26,138 --> 01:07:28,926
It's a crazy business
we're in, you know?

982
01:07:29,016 --> 01:07:31,759
That could happen
to anyone, even you.

983
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:41,102
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank

984
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:43,562
and work it out?

985
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:46,405
I'll fix things between us.

986
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:49,943
You got my word on that.

987
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,448
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out,

988
01:07:55,084 --> 01:07:57,497
we do business
together a long time.

989
01:07:59,505 --> 01:08:00,837
Just remember,

990
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:04,003
I'll only tell you one time,

991
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:07,173
don't fuck me, Tony.

992
01:08:09,807 --> 01:08:11,799
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

993
01:08:25,656 --> 01:08:26,942
You what?

994
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,653
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million

995
01:08:32,747 --> 01:08:34,079
without even checking with me?

996
01:08:34,165 --> 01:08:36,248
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

997
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,120
- <i>Coño</i>. Take it easy.
- <i>Coño,</i> my ass!

998
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:41,328
At 10.5 a key, it's <i>puro.</i>

999
01:08:42,882 --> 01:08:45,215
You can't lose money.
No way.

1000
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:50,712
We make 75 million on this deal.

1001
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,761
75 million.

1002
01:08:54,977 --> 01:08:56,809
That is serious money.

1003
01:08:57,104 --> 01:08:58,936
What is Sosa going to do

1004
01:08:59,023 --> 01:09:01,310
when I don't come up
with the first 5 million?

1005
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,188
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

1006
01:09:04,278 --> 01:09:06,611
He'll send a hit squad up here!

1007
01:09:06,697 --> 01:09:07,799
There'll be a war in the street.

1008
01:09:07,823 --> 01:09:11,567
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

1009
01:09:13,412 --> 01:09:16,530
You short a couple of mil,
I go on the street for you.

1010
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:18,573
I make a couple of moves,

1011
01:09:19,293 --> 01:09:21,660
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.

1012
01:09:23,422 --> 01:09:24,538
Okay?

1013
01:09:27,426 --> 01:09:29,759
You've been making
moves on your own?

1014
01:09:31,972 --> 01:09:34,965
I got ears, you know.
I hear things.

1015
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:41,688
What do you hear about
Echevierra and the Diaz brothers?

1016
01:09:41,774 --> 01:09:43,982
What about Gomez?

1017
01:09:44,068 --> 01:09:46,401
What'll he do when you
start moving 2,000 keys...

1018
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:50,401
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and
fuck the Diaz brothers!

1019
01:09:50,491 --> 01:09:51,732
Fuck them all!

1020
01:09:52,493 --> 01:09:54,826
I'll bury those cockroaches!

1021
01:09:56,413 --> 01:09:58,154
What they ever do for us?

1022
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:08,958
Look, Frank, the time has come.

1023
01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:12,131
We gotta expand.

1024
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,798
The whole operation.
Distribution.

1025
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:20,139
New York, Chicago, LA.

1026
01:10:21,939 --> 01:10:24,682
We gotta set our own
mark and enforce it.

1027
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:27,271
We gotta think big now.

1028
01:10:31,949 --> 01:10:33,156
Think big.

1029
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:40,871
Like your friend Sosa.

1030
01:10:43,294 --> 01:10:46,628
Let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.

1031
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:49,789
He is a snake, that's what he is.

1032
01:10:51,635 --> 01:10:55,549
You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.

1033
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:58,473
You don't trust a guy like that.

1034
01:10:59,977 --> 01:11:02,219
You want me to believe

1035
01:11:02,938 --> 01:11:07,023
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

1036
01:11:07,526 --> 01:11:09,062
You bought that line?

1037
01:11:10,362 --> 01:11:13,196
Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.

1038
01:11:14,658 --> 01:11:17,867
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

1039
01:11:20,998 --> 01:11:22,159
Like what?

1040
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:24,786
Like what?

1041
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,537
You tell me, "Like what."

1042
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,298
You calling me a liar, Frank?

1043
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:38,088
That what you're calling me?

1044
01:11:44,104 --> 01:11:45,720
Let's just say I want things

1045
01:11:45,814 --> 01:11:47,851
to stay the way they are for now.

1046
01:11:51,195 --> 01:11:53,778
You stall your deal with Sosa.

1047
01:11:55,491 --> 01:11:56,777
Stall it?

1048
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:02,703
Okay, boss.

1049
01:12:03,374 --> 01:12:04,410
Come on.

1050
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:08,126
I am the boss.

1051
01:12:09,505 --> 01:12:10,666
Sure, you're the boss.

1052
01:12:10,756 --> 01:12:11,917
Hey, Tony.

1053
01:12:16,303 --> 01:12:18,886
Remember I told you
when you started,

1054
01:12:19,056 --> 01:12:21,548
the guys who last in this business

1055
01:12:22,434 --> 01:12:24,642
are the guys who fly straight,

1056
01:12:25,938 --> 01:12:27,429
low-key, quiet.

1057
01:12:28,732 --> 01:12:30,769
And the guys who want it all,

1058
01:12:31,485 --> 01:12:34,774
<i>chicas,</i> champagne, flash,

1059
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,197
they don't last.

1060
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:40,988
You finished?

1061
01:12:41,912 --> 01:12:43,119
Can I go now?

1062
01:13:05,436 --> 01:13:07,143
Hi, there.

1063
01:13:14,486 --> 01:13:16,102
You just missed Frank.

1064
01:13:19,283 --> 01:13:20,399
Too bad.

1065
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:24,869
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

1066
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:29,328
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

1067
01:13:29,835 --> 01:13:31,292
Next time, make an appointment.

1068
01:13:31,378 --> 01:13:32,414
That's okay.

1069
01:13:32,504 --> 01:13:35,622
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

1070
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:45,139
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks,

1071
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:46,967
act normal,

1072
01:13:49,313 --> 01:13:51,100
and just take it easy?

1073
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:53,806
Come on.
I like Scotch.

1074
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:00,105
Sure. Why not?

1075
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:01,986
Okay.
I won't bite you.

1076
01:14:04,661 --> 01:14:06,653
We're all normal here.

1077
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:14,127
I heard you and Frank aren't
working together anymore.

1078
01:14:14,505 --> 01:14:15,837
That's right.

1079
01:14:20,427 --> 01:14:22,669
I think it's easier, don't you?

1080
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,137
Makes things easier.

1081
01:14:27,684 --> 01:14:28,800
Thank you.

1082
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:32,262
Here's to the land of opportunity.

1083
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:34,772
For you, maybe.

1084
01:14:39,863 --> 01:14:41,024
You like kids?

1085
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,986
Kids?

1086
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:46,860
Kids. You know, kids.
Little kids.

1087
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,705
Sure. Why not?

1088
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,616
As long as there's a nurse.

1089
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:55,668
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

1090
01:14:57,631 --> 01:15:01,716
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

1091
01:15:05,055 --> 01:15:07,172
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

1092
01:15:07,724 --> 01:15:09,181
Come here.

1093
01:15:16,233 --> 01:15:17,233
Sit here.

1094
01:15:18,152 --> 01:15:19,563
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.

1095
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,394
I'm not gonna bite you.

1096
01:15:27,411 --> 01:15:29,198
Okay, here's the story.

1097
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:35,663
I come from the gutter.
I know that.

1098
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:42,086
I got no education,
but that's okay.

1099
01:15:43,427 --> 01:15:45,589
I know the street,

1100
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,171
and I'm making
all the right connections.

1101
01:15:49,266 --> 01:15:52,850
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

1102
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:55,721
I could go right to the top.

1103
01:15:57,858 --> 01:16:01,943
Anyway, what I got
to tell you is this,

1104
01:16:04,114 --> 01:16:05,696
I like you.

1105
01:16:08,952 --> 01:16:11,786
I liked you the first
time I laid eyes on you.

1106
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:17,701
I said, "She's a tiger.

1107
01:16:19,963 --> 01:16:21,955
"She'll belong to me."

1108
01:16:25,969 --> 01:16:27,380
Anyway,

1109
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:30,471
I want you to marry me.

1110
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,473
I want you to be the
mother of my children.

1111
01:16:39,316 --> 01:16:42,309
Me? Marry you?

1112
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:43,651
That's right.

1113
01:16:48,408 --> 01:16:50,149
What about Frank, Tony?

1114
01:16:50,827 --> 01:16:52,409
What will you do about Frank?

1115
01:16:52,496 --> 01:16:56,080
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

1116
01:16:58,418 --> 01:17:01,001
Just think about it, okay?

1117
01:17:02,297 --> 01:17:04,664
I want you to
really think about it.

1118
01:17:07,302 --> 01:17:10,295
I'll go now.
Take care.

1119
01:17:19,022 --> 01:17:20,638
All your enemies are gone.

1120
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:23,391
Mr. Montana.
How are you?

1121
01:17:23,485 --> 01:17:24,692
Hello.

1122
01:17:32,494 --> 01:17:34,406
What the fuck she doing here?

1123
01:17:34,538 --> 01:17:37,030
Come on, man.
She's just dancing.

1124
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:38,865
Come on.
Take it easy.

1125
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:54,263
It's just a disco.

1126
01:17:54,349 --> 01:17:55,556
Who's that guy she's with?

1127
01:17:56,768 --> 01:17:59,135
He's some guy who works for Luco.
He's nobody.

1128
01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:00,936
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?

1129
01:18:01,023 --> 01:18:03,481
Yeah. Forget him.

1130
01:18:05,402 --> 01:18:09,316
Hello, Tony.
You remember me?

1131
01:18:11,742 --> 01:18:15,611
Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?

1132
01:18:16,496 --> 01:18:18,613
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

1133
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:22,200
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

1134
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:25,495
Talk? What are we
going to talk about?

1135
01:18:26,048 --> 01:18:29,041
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

1136
01:18:29,468 --> 01:18:31,255
No, not lately.

1137
01:18:31,345 --> 01:18:35,089
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

1138
01:18:35,182 --> 01:18:38,346
Or a bunch of whacked-out
Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?

1139
01:18:39,936 --> 01:18:42,053
Whoever's giving
you your information

1140
01:18:42,147 --> 01:18:43,854
is taking you for a long ride.

1141
01:18:44,191 --> 01:18:45,352
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:47,809
Tony, baby, we gonna talk,

1143
01:18:47,903 --> 01:18:50,816
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls

1144
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:52,272
here and now?

1145
01:18:58,163 --> 01:18:59,745
Keep your eye on her.

1146
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:02,327
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

1147
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:06,078
- My office.
- Good.

1148
01:19:13,845 --> 01:19:17,464
The word on the street is you're bringing
in a lot of <i>yeyo.</i>

1149
01:19:17,724 --> 01:19:20,216
That means you're not a
small-time punk anymore,

1150
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,176
you're public property now.

1151
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:25,104
Supreme Court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

1152
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,931
Okay. How much?

1153
01:19:28,485 --> 01:19:29,851
How much?

1154
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:33,028
There's an answer to that, too.

1155
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:40,987
Here's how much.

1156
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:43,535
Can you see it?

1157
01:19:45,585 --> 01:19:47,451
- Big number.
- Yeah!

1158
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:50,542
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1159
01:19:51,007 --> 01:19:52,714
You know how this works?

1160
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:56,047
No. You tell me.

1161
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:59,051
We tell you who's
moving against you,

1162
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:02,221
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1163
01:20:03,103 --> 01:20:06,437
Let's say that you got a real
problem making a collection.

1164
01:20:07,816 --> 01:20:09,728
And then we step in for you.

1165
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:12,485
Got eight killers with
badges working for me.

1166
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:13,857
When they hit, it hurts.

1167
01:20:13,947 --> 01:20:15,654
Same thing works the other way.

1168
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,823
You feed me a bust now and then.

1169
01:20:18,201 --> 01:20:21,444
Some cowboy setting
himself up in business.

1170
01:20:22,122 --> 01:20:24,364
Small fry, you know?

1171
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,786
We like snacks.

1172
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:33,414
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

1173
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:38,845
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

1174
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:42,594
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

1175
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:45,518
Well, that's not my business, Tony.

1176
01:20:45,604 --> 01:20:46,890
We don't cross no lines.

1177
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:50,974
You think I want this conversation

1178
01:20:51,067 --> 01:20:52,854
going any farther than this table?

1179
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,563
My guys' got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1180
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:58,857
I don't want to see
them embarrassed.

1181
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:00,816
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1182
01:21:00,911 --> 01:21:03,619
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

1183
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:08,575
You understand
what I'm talking about?

1184
01:21:09,127 --> 01:21:10,243
Huh?

1185
01:21:19,262 --> 01:21:20,924
Thanks for the drink.

1186
01:21:23,808 --> 01:21:25,265
By the way,

1187
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:28,303
I got a vacation coming up.

1188
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:31,014
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1189
01:21:31,107 --> 01:21:32,564
We've never been there.

1190
01:21:32,651 --> 01:21:35,940
So throw in a couple of
round-trip tickets, first class.

1191
01:21:42,827 --> 01:21:46,070
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

1192
01:21:46,706 --> 01:21:49,119
Every day above
ground is a good day.

1193
01:22:01,888 --> 01:22:02,888
Hello.

1194
01:22:02,973 --> 01:22:03,973
Hello.

1195
01:22:05,392 --> 01:22:07,475
Yeah.
Now that's the idea.

1196
01:22:07,644 --> 01:22:09,351
Okay, Mel.

1197
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:13,647
You think about what I said?

1198
01:22:14,192 --> 01:22:15,478
About the kids?

1199
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:19,604
You know, you are really nuts.

1200
01:22:19,698 --> 01:22:21,360
I'm nuts about you.

1201
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,567
Why don't you find your own girl?

1202
01:22:24,828 --> 01:22:25,989
- My own girl?
- Yeah.

1203
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:27,195
That's what I'm doing.

1204
01:22:27,289 --> 01:22:29,121
Go do it somewhere else.
Get lost.

1205
01:22:29,207 --> 01:22:31,494
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

1206
01:22:31,585 --> 01:22:33,872
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

1207
01:22:34,004 --> 01:22:35,165
Will you do something?

1208
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:37,998
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

1209
01:22:39,259 --> 01:22:41,216
I'm giving you orders.
Blow!

1210
01:22:41,344 --> 01:22:45,008
Orders?
You giving me orders?

1211
01:22:50,604 --> 01:22:52,937
The only thing in this world

1212
01:22:53,023 --> 01:22:56,687
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

1213
01:22:58,194 --> 01:22:59,401
Balls.

1214
01:23:09,873 --> 01:23:11,034
Let's go.

1215
01:23:18,882 --> 01:23:19,963
Elvira.

1216
01:23:21,384 --> 01:23:24,218
When you gonna learn? Huh?

1217
01:23:25,889 --> 01:23:29,599
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

1218
01:23:31,394 --> 01:23:32,394
That cocksucker.

1219
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:33,504
What happened?

1220
01:23:34,397 --> 01:23:37,060
He put that prick Bernstein on me.

1221
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:38,231
Who? Lopez did?

1222
01:23:39,736 --> 01:23:40,817
How do you know?

1223
01:23:40,904 --> 01:23:43,396
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?

1224
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,652
He's fertilizer.

1225
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,742
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

1226
01:23:51,915 --> 01:23:53,531
I'll tell you what, man.

1227
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:56,584
You know our little trip
we've been planning to New York?

1228
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,411
It might be a good time.

1229
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,437
Wait.
Where you going?

1230
01:24:43,216 --> 01:24:44,957
Welcome to my private room.

1231
01:24:45,051 --> 01:24:46,383
Your private room.

1232
01:24:46,469 --> 01:24:47,755
This is my private room.

1233
01:24:47,846 --> 01:24:51,510
I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.

1234
01:24:56,646 --> 01:24:59,013
Gina, you taste so <i>muy bueno.</i>

1235
01:25:02,902 --> 01:25:03,902
Tony!

1236
01:25:04,487 --> 01:25:06,353
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1237
01:25:06,489 --> 01:25:08,731
What?
We wasn't doing nothing!

1238
01:25:08,825 --> 01:25:10,157
Fernando, wait!

1239
01:25:10,493 --> 01:25:11,825
Get out!

1240
01:25:14,664 --> 01:25:15,996
Damn you!

1241
01:25:16,082 --> 01:25:17,823
You think he's cute?

1242
01:25:17,917 --> 01:25:20,375
I saw him putting his
hand all over your ass.

1243
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:22,335
My kid sister in a toilet.

1244
01:25:22,422 --> 01:25:23,663
It's none of your business.

1245
01:25:23,757 --> 01:25:26,170
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

1246
01:25:26,259 --> 01:25:27,420
You can't tell me what to do!

1247
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:28,591
I am telling you!

1248
01:25:28,678 --> 01:25:30,670
Listen to me.
Come here.

1249
01:25:31,723 --> 01:25:35,558
I catch you here again,

1250
01:25:35,643 --> 01:25:37,329
I'm gonna wipe you all
over the fucking place.

1251
01:25:37,353 --> 01:25:40,266
Yeah? Go ahead! Do it now.
I want to see it.

1252
01:25:40,356 --> 01:25:41,542
I want to see it now, big shot.

1253
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:42,647
Don't push me.

1254
01:25:42,734 --> 01:25:43,895
I want to see it now!

1255
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:46,272
Don't push me!
Get outta here!

1256
01:25:46,529 --> 01:25:48,065
Go outside.

1257
01:25:48,156 --> 01:25:50,113
You got some nerve, Tony!

1258
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,238
You think you can
tell me what to do?

1259
01:25:53,369 --> 01:25:55,110
You can't tell me what to do.

1260
01:25:55,205 --> 01:25:56,321
I'm not a baby anymore.

1261
01:25:56,414 --> 01:25:59,282
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

1262
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,459
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

1263
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:06,751
Fucking, man!
Come on, man.

1264
01:26:10,929 --> 01:26:14,138
What the fuck you want?
You want something? Huh?

1265
01:26:14,474 --> 01:26:16,716
No. Don't touch me.

1266
01:26:18,895 --> 01:26:20,557
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

1267
01:26:20,647 --> 01:26:24,561
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

1268
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:27,630
<i>Another great night here at the Babylon, right?</i>

1269
01:26:27,654 --> 01:26:29,611
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

1270
01:26:29,906 --> 01:26:31,586
<i>Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.</i>

1271
01:26:33,493 --> 01:26:36,281
<i>Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?</i>

1272
01:26:36,412 --> 01:26:38,404
<i>A little bit of hope,
I'm sure, yes.</i>

1273
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:41,616
<i>I'm in a good mood. I was depressed
when I got up this morning.</i>

1274
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:44,619
<i>I had a dry dream,
but I'm better now.</i>

1275
01:26:59,936 --> 01:27:01,893
<i>I do Laurel and Hardy
in Spanish, too.</i>

1276
01:27:04,858 --> 01:27:06,975
<i>That's the height of culture,
I assure you.</i>

1277
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:09,648
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all
time has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

1278
01:27:10,822 --> 01:27:12,859
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

1279
01:27:12,949 --> 01:27:14,781
<i>He had the same
problem for 10 years.</i>

1280
01:27:14,868 --> 01:27:17,531
<i>"Lucy, don't come
down to the club."</i>

1281
01:27:49,444 --> 01:27:52,562
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

1282
01:27:52,655 --> 01:27:54,738
All right?
He cares about you.

1283
01:27:54,824 --> 01:27:57,407
To him, you're still his little sister.

1284
01:27:57,535 --> 01:28:00,949
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1285
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:02,575
I'm 20 years old now.

1286
01:28:02,665 --> 01:28:04,076
I'm not anybody's baby.

1287
01:28:04,167 --> 01:28:05,533
You're so grown-up.

1288
01:28:08,338 --> 01:28:11,672
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

1289
01:28:11,799 --> 01:28:15,418
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life,

1290
01:28:15,511 --> 01:28:19,425
the only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

1291
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:23,263
Of course he doesn't want
you mixing with those people,

1292
01:28:23,353 --> 01:28:24,685
growing up to be like him.

1293
01:28:26,022 --> 01:28:27,763
He has this father thing for you.

1294
01:28:27,857 --> 01:28:29,348
Feels like he has to protect you.

1295
01:28:29,442 --> 01:28:31,183
Protect me against what?

1296
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:33,728
Against guys like that asshole

1297
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:35,107
you were dancing with tonight.

1298
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:39,283
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1299
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:43,783
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

1300
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,872
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

1301
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,037
By taking her to the toilet
to make out?

1302
01:28:48,169 --> 01:28:50,286
<i>You've been a great audience.</i>

1303
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,212
<i>I got a special treat for you.</i>

1304
01:28:52,298 --> 01:28:53,880
<i>Here's a guy I found in the jungle</i>

1305
01:28:53,967 --> 01:28:55,083
<i>from Caracas, Venezuela.</i>

1306
01:28:55,176 --> 01:28:56,792
<i>He's unlike anything you've seen.</i>

1307
01:28:56,886 --> 01:29:00,505
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!</i>

1308
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:28,332
Look around.
Go out with someone

1309
01:29:28,418 --> 01:29:29,478
who has something on the ball,

1310
01:29:29,502 --> 01:29:30,993
who's going somewhere in life.

1311
01:29:31,087 --> 01:29:32,203
Like who?

1312
01:29:32,922 --> 01:29:36,256
For instance, someone who's
got a real job, like a banker.

1313
01:29:36,384 --> 01:29:37,966
Or... Or a doctor,
a lawyer...

1314
01:29:38,052 --> 01:29:39,259
What about you?

1315
01:29:41,681 --> 01:29:43,217
What are you talking about?

1316
01:29:43,307 --> 01:29:44,843
Why don't you take me out?

1317
01:29:44,934 --> 01:29:46,846
Are you crazy?

1318
01:29:46,936 --> 01:29:48,928
I see the way
you look at me, Manolo.

1319
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:50,721
Do you think I'm blind?
I see.

1320
01:29:50,815 --> 01:29:52,056
Come on.

1321
01:29:52,525 --> 01:29:54,437
- What?
- Look, Gina,

1322
01:29:55,945 --> 01:29:58,608
Tony and I are
like brothers, all right?

1323
01:29:58,948 --> 01:30:00,610
You're his kid sister.

1324
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,362
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

1325
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:04,280
That's where it stays.

1326
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:06,282
Are you afraid of Tony, huh?

1327
01:30:07,206 --> 01:30:08,538
You afraid of Tony's kid sister?

1328
01:30:08,624 --> 01:30:10,707
I'm not afraid of anybody!

1329
01:30:11,044 --> 01:30:12,956
That's not the point here!

1330
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:29,721
Oh, fuck.

1331
01:32:31,559 --> 01:32:33,516
It's not for me.
Don't look at me.

1332
01:32:33,603 --> 01:32:35,344
How do you know?

1333
01:32:35,438 --> 01:32:36,679
'Cause I'm not here.

1334
01:32:36,772 --> 01:32:38,638
Oh, really?
Then where are you?

1335
01:32:41,652 --> 01:32:43,188
Shit, you're weird.

1336
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:44,395
I'm weird?

1337
01:32:44,488 --> 01:32:45,604
Hello?

1338
01:32:45,698 --> 01:32:46,734
<i>Hello, Miriam?</i>

1339
01:32:46,824 --> 01:32:48,110
Tony!

1340
01:32:48,201 --> 01:32:50,033
<i>Put Manny on, okay?</i>

1341
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:51,451
Okay. Just a second.

1342
01:32:51,787 --> 01:32:53,073
It's Tony.

1343
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,325
What are you doing,
checking up on me?

1344
01:32:58,419 --> 01:33:00,251
Get your clothes on and meet me

1345
01:33:00,338 --> 01:33:02,250
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

1346
01:33:03,049 --> 01:33:04,631
What? What happened?

1347
01:33:04,717 --> 01:33:06,253
<i>Nothing we can't fix.</i>

1348
01:33:06,886 --> 01:33:09,253
All right.
I'll be there.

1349
01:33:09,347 --> 01:33:11,964
<i>You're still
on the phone. Let's go.</i>

1350
01:33:12,058 --> 01:33:13,174
Take it easy, okay?

1351
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:16,135
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1352
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:18,345
- Nick?
- Yeah, Tony.

1353
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:20,772
This is what I want
you to do for me,

1354
01:33:22,193 --> 01:33:23,980
you call Lopez.

1355
01:33:24,487 --> 01:33:28,151
Call him at his office
at 3:00 sharp.

1356
01:33:29,075 --> 01:33:31,988
And you tell him,

1357
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,282
"We fucked up, he got away."

1358
01:33:35,957 --> 01:33:37,073
Okay. Yeah.

1359
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:38,498
Got it? What are you going to say?

1360
01:33:38,584 --> 01:33:40,496
"We fucked up. He got away."

1361
01:33:42,338 --> 01:33:44,000
- What time?
- 3:00 sharp.

1362
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,008
So when are we gonna
make some money on this thing?

1363
01:33:49,136 --> 01:33:52,095
Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.

1364
01:33:52,682 --> 01:33:55,925
I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.

1365
01:33:57,603 --> 01:33:59,310
So you owe me.

1366
01:34:00,523 --> 01:34:03,015
Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight?

1367
01:34:03,484 --> 01:34:05,100
I couldn't make it.
I got things.

1368
01:34:05,194 --> 01:34:06,776
I'll tell you about them.

1369
01:34:07,697 --> 01:34:11,031
You're kidding. What was the score?
Three to two?

1370
01:34:12,368 --> 01:34:13,609
Mel, guess what.

1371
01:34:13,703 --> 01:34:15,535
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers,

1372
01:34:15,663 --> 01:34:17,370
they won the division tonight.

1373
01:34:17,498 --> 01:34:19,831
That's great.
Congratulations.

1374
01:34:20,209 --> 01:34:23,043
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

1375
01:34:25,965 --> 01:34:28,548
Jesus Christ.

1376
01:34:30,469 --> 01:34:32,381
Tony, what happened to you?

1377
01:34:35,224 --> 01:34:38,183
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

1378
01:34:39,228 --> 01:34:41,345
Who the fuck did this?

1379
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:44,644
Hitters. I don't know.

1380
01:34:45,735 --> 01:34:47,897
Somebody must've brought them in.

1381
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:50,361
I've never seen them before.

1382
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,151
Hello, Mel.

1383
01:34:53,534 --> 01:34:55,321
Got an answer to this, too?

1384
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:57,702
There always is, Tony.

1385
01:34:57,788 --> 01:34:59,745
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

1386
01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:02,662
They got a beef going
back to the Sun Ray thing.

1387
01:35:03,878 --> 01:35:07,872
Maybe you're right, you know?

1388
01:35:08,341 --> 01:35:12,881
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

1389
01:35:13,929 --> 01:35:17,013
We'll return the favor
for you in spades.

1390
01:35:17,099 --> 01:35:19,887
I'll take care of this myself.

1391
01:35:25,733 --> 01:35:27,599
What is the gun for, Tony?

1392
01:35:28,569 --> 01:35:31,277
What, this?
It's nothing.

1393
01:35:32,948 --> 01:35:37,238
I'm...
How do you say? Paranoid.

1394
01:35:51,634 --> 01:35:53,466
You gonna answer, Frank?

1395
01:35:55,638 --> 01:35:59,302
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

1396
01:36:02,478 --> 01:36:04,390
I'll tell her
you're not here, okay?

1397
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:08,315
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

1398
01:36:16,283 --> 01:36:17,490
Hello.

1399
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:27,750
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

1400
01:36:30,756 --> 01:36:33,965
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

1401
01:36:34,093 --> 01:36:36,301
What are you talking about?

1402
01:36:36,387 --> 01:36:37,719
You know what I'm talking about,

1403
01:36:37,805 --> 01:36:40,297
you fucking cockroach.

1404
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:43,346
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, huh.

1405
01:36:43,477 --> 01:36:45,685
You know what a <i>chazer</i> is, Frank?

1406
01:36:46,689 --> 01:36:49,682
That's a pig
that don't fly straight.

1407
01:36:50,818 --> 01:36:52,400
Neither do you, Frank.

1408
01:36:53,988 --> 01:36:56,822
Tony, why the fuck
would I hurt you?

1409
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:58,861
I brought you in.

1410
01:36:58,993 --> 01:37:01,531
So we had a few differences,
no big deal.

1411
01:37:02,872 --> 01:37:05,785
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1412
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:08,037
I stayed loyal to you.

1413
01:37:10,337 --> 01:37:12,044
I made what I could on the side,

1414
01:37:12,131 --> 01:37:13,838
but I never turned on you, Frank!

1415
01:37:14,508 --> 01:37:15,544
Never!

1416
01:37:19,263 --> 01:37:20,504
But you,

1417
01:37:24,059 --> 01:37:28,554
a man who ain't got his word
is a cockroach.

1418
01:37:32,193 --> 01:37:34,901
Mel. Do something, will you?

1419
01:37:39,241 --> 01:37:41,904
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

1420
01:37:49,752 --> 01:37:52,916
All right, Tony.
I was the one.

1421
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,087
Please, give me a second chance.

1422
01:38:03,933 --> 01:38:06,767
Will you do that?
Please?

1423
01:38:11,607 --> 01:38:15,351
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

1424
01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:19,146
Okay? $10 million.

1425
01:38:19,782 --> 01:38:22,991
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

1426
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:27,658
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1427
01:38:28,332 --> 01:38:31,666
Okay? All of it.
$10 million.

1428
01:38:32,586 --> 01:38:33,747
Okay, Tony?

1429
01:38:35,631 --> 01:38:36,838
Huh?

1430
01:38:37,841 --> 01:38:39,173
Please, Tony?

1431
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:44,179
Elvira?
You want Elvira?

1432
01:38:44,974 --> 01:38:48,012
You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.

1433
01:38:48,143 --> 01:38:49,975
You'll never see me again.

1434
01:38:50,062 --> 01:38:51,678
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

1435
01:38:51,814 --> 01:38:53,771
I never did nothing to nobody.

1436
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:56,809
No, you never did
nothing to nobody.

1437
01:38:57,111 --> 01:38:59,023
You had somebody
else do it for you.

1438
01:38:59,154 --> 01:39:00,440
Oh, Tony, I'm begging you.

1439
01:39:00,531 --> 01:39:02,147
Get up! Get up now!

1440
01:39:02,241 --> 01:39:04,324
Jesus!
No! God!

1441
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:12,995
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

1442
01:39:15,963 --> 01:39:17,374
I won't kill you.

1443
01:39:18,048 --> 01:39:20,040
- Oh, Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

1444
01:39:20,175 --> 01:39:21,632
Thank you.

1445
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:23,836
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

1446
01:39:24,096 --> 01:39:25,507
No, no!

1447
01:39:25,848 --> 01:39:27,259
No!

1448
01:39:45,826 --> 01:39:48,694
Every dog has his day, huh, Mel?

1449
01:39:48,829 --> 01:39:50,036
I told him

1450
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,406
it didn't make any sense

1451
01:39:53,542 --> 01:39:57,377
clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1452
01:39:58,172 --> 01:40:02,007
He got hot tonight about the broad.

1453
01:40:04,094 --> 01:40:05,551
He fucked up.

1454
01:40:06,347 --> 01:40:10,057
You, too, Mel.
You fucked up.

1455
01:40:11,268 --> 01:40:12,930
Don't go too far, Tony.

1456
01:40:14,563 --> 01:40:17,306
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1457
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:29,071
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

1458
01:40:30,621 --> 01:40:32,157
Whoever says you was one?

1459
01:40:32,247 --> 01:40:33,783
Wait a minute!

1460
01:40:35,918 --> 01:40:38,080
You let me go.
I'll fix this up.

1461
01:40:38,587 --> 01:40:42,672
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can handle yourself

1462
01:40:43,092 --> 01:40:46,426
one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

1463
01:40:46,929 --> 01:40:50,593
Fucking punk!
Son of a bitch!

1464
01:40:52,351 --> 01:40:54,013
So long, Mel.
Have a good trip.

1465
01:40:54,103 --> 01:40:55,139
Fuck you!

1466
01:41:01,944 --> 01:41:03,526
Okay, come on.

1467
01:41:03,612 --> 01:41:05,148
What about Ernie?

1468
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:16,952
You want a job, Ernie?

1469
01:41:20,504 --> 01:41:21,790
Sure, Tony.

1470
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,667
Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

1471
01:41:24,383 --> 01:41:26,215
Man, you got a job!

1472
01:41:27,136 --> 01:41:29,970
Tony! Thanks.

1473
01:41:59,918 --> 01:42:00,999
Tony.

1474
01:42:05,215 --> 01:42:07,047
God, what's happened?

1475
01:42:09,344 --> 01:42:10,710
Where's Frank?

1476
01:42:12,514 --> 01:42:14,221
Where do you think?

1477
01:42:19,521 --> 01:42:23,014
Come on.
Get your stuff.

1478
01:42:23,525 --> 01:42:25,061
You're coming with me.

1479
01:47:02,137 --> 01:47:05,596
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

1480
01:47:05,682 --> 01:47:07,674
You propose it, I talk to you.

1481
01:47:08,143 --> 01:47:11,432
But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.

1482
01:47:12,564 --> 01:47:15,557
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

1483
01:47:15,776 --> 01:47:19,144
We're doing 10 million,
15 million a month. Come on.

1484
01:47:19,321 --> 01:47:21,358
That's serious money.

1485
01:47:21,656 --> 01:47:23,443
You bank boys
gotta come down a bit.

1486
01:47:23,533 --> 01:47:24,569
No way.

1487
01:47:24,659 --> 01:47:26,901
That's crazy.
We can't do that.

1488
01:47:26,995 --> 01:47:28,452
Then that's too bad.

1489
01:47:28,747 --> 01:47:30,704
What am I gonna do?

1490
01:47:30,791 --> 01:47:32,032
We're not a wholesale operation.

1491
01:47:32,125 --> 01:47:35,789
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me,

1492
01:47:35,879 --> 01:47:38,121
the harder it is for me to rinse.

1493
01:47:38,632 --> 01:47:40,498
That's a problem.
I didn't know.

1494
01:47:40,592 --> 01:47:43,505
The fact is, I can't take
any more of your money

1495
01:47:43,595 --> 01:47:45,928
unless I raise the rates on you.

1496
01:47:47,557 --> 01:47:49,389
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.

1497
01:47:49,476 --> 01:47:50,637
The IRS is coming...

1498
01:47:50,727 --> 01:47:53,390
Don't give me that shit!
Let's talk.

1499
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,516
I'm talking.

1500
01:47:54,606 --> 01:47:57,098
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1501
01:47:57,192 --> 01:47:58,353
This is business talk.

1502
01:47:58,443 --> 01:47:59,729
Let me explain something.

1503
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:02,278
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

1504
01:48:02,364 --> 01:48:04,777
There was a <i>TIME</i> magazine story
that didn't help.

1505
01:48:04,866 --> 01:48:06,323
There's a recession.

1506
01:48:06,409 --> 01:48:08,742
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

1507
01:48:08,829 --> 01:48:09,945
I got to do it, Tony.

1508
01:48:10,038 --> 01:48:11,245
You'll learn from him.

1509
01:48:11,331 --> 01:48:14,699
I got to go 10 % on the first 12 million
in denominations of 20.

1510
01:48:14,793 --> 01:48:16,785
I'll go 8 % on your $10 bills,

1511
01:48:16,878 --> 01:48:17,914
6 % on your fives.

1512
01:48:18,004 --> 01:48:19,791
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

1513
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:22,043
There's no place else to go.

1514
01:48:22,134 --> 01:48:23,420
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

1515
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:26,503
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1516
01:48:26,847 --> 01:48:29,385
Once, maybe.
Then what?

1517
01:48:30,016 --> 01:48:32,303
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank

1518
01:48:32,394 --> 01:48:34,477
with 20 million of
your hard-earned dollars?

1519
01:48:34,563 --> 01:48:36,395
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.

1520
01:48:36,773 --> 01:48:38,059
Who else can you trust?

1521
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:40,938
That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.

1522
01:48:41,736 --> 01:48:42,852
Huh?

1523
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:47,481
Did you hear that guy?

1524
01:48:47,868 --> 01:48:50,531
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1525
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:51,827
Stay with us.

1526
01:48:51,913 --> 01:48:54,997
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1527
01:48:57,419 --> 01:48:58,580
And I got to run.

1528
01:48:58,670 --> 01:48:59,786
I'm safe but poor.

1529
01:49:01,214 --> 01:49:03,171
How's married life treating you?

1530
01:49:03,258 --> 01:49:04,339
Better than you are.

1531
01:49:05,886 --> 01:49:09,050
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

1532
01:49:09,139 --> 01:49:11,677
I'll see you.
Take care.

1533
01:49:11,766 --> 01:49:12,847
You, too.

1534
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:27,696
That prick!

1535
01:49:29,326 --> 01:49:30,942
Fucking WASP whore.

1536
01:49:31,995 --> 01:49:35,204
Talking to me like I'm some <i>maricón</i>
who came over on a boat.

1537
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:40,209
I tell you what. We don't need that
smiling motherfucker.

1538
01:49:40,295 --> 01:49:43,788
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1539
01:49:44,132 --> 01:49:48,092
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4 % at the most.

1540
01:49:48,803 --> 01:49:50,339
And he's connected.

1541
01:49:51,556 --> 01:49:55,800
Fuck them.
Mob guys. Guineas.

1542
01:49:57,062 --> 01:49:58,598
I don't trust them.

1543
01:50:17,916 --> 01:50:20,750
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1544
01:50:21,211 --> 01:50:24,830
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1545
01:50:26,007 --> 01:50:27,589
Look at that.

1546
01:50:27,676 --> 01:50:28,837
What?

1547
01:50:29,427 --> 01:50:31,043
That cable truck there.

1548
01:50:31,137 --> 01:50:34,050
Since when does it take
three days to rig a cable?

1549
01:50:36,351 --> 01:50:38,934
What? You been watching
it for three days?

1550
01:50:40,897 --> 01:50:43,139
The thing has been
there for three days.

1551
01:50:43,233 --> 01:50:45,020
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

1552
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:47,272
What, you think it's cops, right?

1553
01:50:47,362 --> 01:50:48,478
I don't know.

1554
01:50:48,697 --> 01:50:51,986
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1555
01:50:53,827 --> 01:50:56,740
Maybe.
I'll check it out, okay?

1556
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:57,911
You check it out.

1557
01:50:57,998 --> 01:51:01,491
Then we're gonna blow that
fucking truck back to Colombia!

1558
01:51:01,793 --> 01:51:06,128
Come on. We're not the only
dopers living on the block.

1559
01:51:06,214 --> 01:51:07,546
Okay? Remember that.

1560
01:51:07,632 --> 01:51:10,625
That truck could be
anybody and anything.

1561
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:12,085
It could be a cable company...

1562
01:51:12,178 --> 01:51:14,511
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1563
01:51:14,597 --> 01:51:17,260
For someone who's in
charge of my security...

1564
01:51:17,684 --> 01:51:20,722
Here are the keys
to the front door.

1565
01:51:20,812 --> 01:51:22,678
Go down there.
Give them the keys!

1566
01:51:22,772 --> 01:51:24,479
I'm just trying to say something.

1567
01:51:24,566 --> 01:51:27,604
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1568
01:51:27,694 --> 01:51:28,810
I don't give a fuck.

1569
01:51:28,903 --> 01:51:31,520
It's 12 % of our adjusted gross.

1570
01:51:31,614 --> 01:51:32,821
12 % isn't peanuts.

1571
01:51:32,907 --> 01:51:34,068
I don't give a fuck!

1572
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:36,617
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

1573
01:51:36,703 --> 01:51:37,944
Okay?
You worry about it.

1574
01:51:38,038 --> 01:51:39,074
I am worried about it.

1575
01:51:39,164 --> 01:51:41,907
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1576
01:51:42,417 --> 01:51:46,001
Our thinking,
our fucking attitude, you know?

1577
01:51:46,212 --> 01:51:47,999
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

1578
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:50,707
<i>Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.</i>

1579
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,712
<i>New construction.
New jobs.</i>

1580
01:51:52,927 --> 01:51:55,761
<i>Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.</i>

1581
01:51:55,847 --> 01:51:58,464
<i>We've put your money
to work for 75 years,</i>

1582
01:51:58,558 --> 01:52:00,595
<i>building a more prosperous Miami.</i>

1583
01:52:01,019 --> 01:52:03,056
<i>Count on us being here tomorrow.</i>

1584
01:52:03,146 --> 01:52:06,310
That's because for 75 years,
you been fucking everybody.

1585
01:52:06,608 --> 01:52:10,272
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1586
01:52:10,612 --> 01:52:13,195
I mean, charging me
10 points on my money.

1587
01:52:13,281 --> 01:52:15,568
They're getting away with it.

1588
01:52:15,658 --> 01:52:17,069
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1589
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,617
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

1590
01:52:18,703 --> 01:52:20,569
They been around 1,000 years.

1591
01:52:20,663 --> 01:52:22,780
They got all the
angles figured out.

1592
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:26,284
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1593
01:52:26,419 --> 01:52:28,536
True capitalist
if ever I met one.

1594
01:52:29,255 --> 01:52:30,336
Uh-oh.

1595
01:52:30,423 --> 01:52:32,164
Did you hear that?

1596
01:52:33,468 --> 01:52:35,460
How would you know, bubblehead?

1597
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:38,762
You ever do nothing
besides get your hair fixed

1598
01:52:38,848 --> 01:52:40,089
and powder your nose?

1599
01:52:40,266 --> 01:52:42,804
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1600
01:52:42,894 --> 01:52:45,011
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1601
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:47,893
You should know that, Tony.

1602
01:52:47,982 --> 01:52:49,018
I should know what?

1603
01:52:50,276 --> 01:52:51,767
What should I know?

1604
01:52:51,903 --> 01:52:54,520
Why do you have to talk to
me like that all the time,

1605
01:52:54,614 --> 01:52:56,071
like I got to know something?

1606
01:52:56,157 --> 01:52:57,523
Let me talk to you.

1607
01:52:57,826 --> 01:52:59,158
- Listen.
- What time is it?

1608
01:52:59,244 --> 01:53:00,530
This Seidelbaum...

1609
01:53:00,912 --> 01:53:02,153
6:55.

1610
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:03,411
Okay.

1611
01:53:03,498 --> 01:53:04,767
I met with this guy Seidelbaum...

1612
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:08,250
<i>The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...</i>

1613
01:53:08,711 --> 01:53:10,998
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1614
01:53:11,089 --> 01:53:15,299
<i>With a small law-enforcement budget,
how can you put a dent</i>

1615
01:53:15,385 --> 01:53:19,971
<i>on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

1616
01:53:20,682 --> 01:53:22,548
<i>It seems at times all you can do</i>

1617
01:53:22,642 --> 01:53:24,679
<i>is put your finger
in the dike and pray.</i>

1618
01:53:24,769 --> 01:53:26,601
Put your fingers in a dyke?

1619
01:53:26,938 --> 01:53:29,180
The only place you
can get your fingers

1620
01:53:29,274 --> 01:53:30,640
is in some dyke.

1621
01:53:31,484 --> 01:53:33,692
<i>...not by outlawing the substances,</i>

1622
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:36,278
<i>but by legalizing and taxing them.</i>

1623
01:53:36,614 --> 01:53:41,734
<i>These voices say that will drive
out the organized crime element.</i>

1624
01:53:42,412 --> 01:53:44,574
<i>I am not one of those voices.</i>

1625
01:53:44,664 --> 01:53:46,371
I know that.
But you know why?

1626
01:53:46,458 --> 01:53:49,292
'Cause you got your head
up your <i>culo,</i> that's why.

1627
01:53:49,377 --> 01:53:51,710
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1628
01:53:51,796 --> 01:53:54,880
<i>...splendor of our city at its best.</i>

1629
01:53:55,175 --> 01:53:56,837
It's those guys, man!

1630
01:53:56,926 --> 01:53:59,088
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians,

1631
01:53:59,179 --> 01:54:01,421
they're the ones that
wanna make coke illegal

1632
01:54:01,514 --> 01:54:03,176
so they can make the fucking money

1633
01:54:03,266 --> 01:54:04,928
and then get the fucking votes!

1634
01:54:05,018 --> 01:54:08,227
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1635
01:54:08,521 --> 01:54:10,387
They fuck anything and anyone.

1636
01:54:10,482 --> 01:54:13,566
Can't you stop saying
"fuck" all the time?

1637
01:54:13,735 --> 01:54:16,398
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1638
01:54:16,488 --> 01:54:20,528
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1639
01:54:20,658 --> 01:54:22,240
- You're boring.
- Oh.

1640
01:54:22,702 --> 01:54:25,945
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

1641
01:54:26,206 --> 01:54:29,199
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

1642
01:54:29,292 --> 01:54:30,328
Here it is.

1643
01:54:30,418 --> 01:54:31,954
Frank never talked about money.

1644
01:54:36,341 --> 01:54:38,799
That's 'cause he was so smart.

1645
01:54:46,059 --> 01:54:47,721
You know what you're becoming?

1646
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:51,224
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1647
01:54:51,314 --> 01:54:54,682
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1648
01:54:54,776 --> 01:54:56,267
Get out of the way of the TV!

1649
01:54:56,361 --> 01:54:59,104
Dig a hole in the garden, bury it,
and forget about it.

1650
01:54:59,364 --> 01:55:02,607
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1651
01:55:06,588 --> 01:55:08,955
Somebody should've given it to you.

1652
01:55:08,998 --> 01:55:10,455
You would've been a nicer person.

1653
01:55:12,585 --> 01:55:14,622
Know what your problem is, pussycat?

1654
01:55:14,712 --> 01:55:16,294
What is my problem?

1655
01:55:17,048 --> 01:55:19,540
You got nothing to
do with your life.

1656
01:55:20,677 --> 01:55:23,420
Why don't you get
a job or something?

1657
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:25,842
Do something.
Be a nurse.

1658
01:55:26,683 --> 01:55:29,551
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1659
01:55:30,979 --> 01:55:33,141
Anything beats lying around all day

1660
01:55:33,231 --> 01:55:34,722
waiting for me to fuck you!

1661
01:55:35,358 --> 01:55:37,850
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1662
01:55:37,944 --> 01:55:40,061
No? Frank was better?

1663
01:55:41,364 --> 01:55:42,855
You're an asshole!

1664
01:55:43,741 --> 01:55:45,698
Where you going?
Come here!

1665
01:55:46,369 --> 01:55:48,611
Elvie!

1666
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:50,662
I was kidding!

1667
01:55:52,166 --> 01:55:53,702
I was only kidding!

1668
01:55:53,793 --> 01:55:56,080
I guess sometimes married life

1669
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:58,036
is not all it's cracked up to be.

1670
01:55:58,256 --> 01:55:59,713
Where you going?

1671
01:55:59,799 --> 01:56:00,799
I got a date.

1672
01:56:01,676 --> 01:56:03,292
- You got a date? Come here.
- Yeah.

1673
01:56:08,433 --> 01:56:10,516
What?

1674
01:56:10,602 --> 01:56:11,638
This Seidelbaum thing.

1675
01:56:12,353 --> 01:56:13,935
Yeah, it's all set up.

1676
01:56:14,397 --> 01:56:16,309
Yeah, well, you forget it.

1677
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:18,391
Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.

1678
01:56:18,484 --> 01:56:21,227
Stay out of it?
It's my deal. I set it up.

1679
01:56:21,529 --> 01:56:23,896
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1680
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:26,403
You like the ladies
more than the money.

1681
01:56:26,492 --> 01:56:27,528
That's your problem.

1682
01:56:27,619 --> 01:56:30,532
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1683
01:56:30,622 --> 01:56:33,035
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing,

1684
01:56:33,124 --> 01:56:34,660
who're you gonna trust?

1685
01:56:34,751 --> 01:56:35,992
Junior partner.

1686
01:56:37,462 --> 01:56:38,543
Bullshit, man.

1687
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:40,997
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

1688
01:56:41,716 --> 01:56:44,174
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1689
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:45,967
You are an asshole, man!

1690
01:56:46,929 --> 01:56:49,262
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1691
01:56:50,475 --> 01:56:51,932
Fuck you, man!

1692
01:56:53,019 --> 01:56:56,512
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1693
01:56:57,690 --> 01:56:59,898
Who do I trust? Me!

1694
01:57:00,526 --> 01:57:02,563
Fuck him. "Trust."

1695
01:57:05,365 --> 01:57:08,449
Asshole.
Fuck called me an asshole.

1696
01:57:09,369 --> 01:57:10,735
I need that shit.

1697
01:57:12,413 --> 01:57:13,904
I don't need him.

1698
01:57:14,916 --> 01:57:18,751
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1699
01:57:20,254 --> 01:57:22,462
Back then I worked in
pictures down in Colombia.

1700
01:57:22,548 --> 01:57:25,291
I was in that movie <i>Burn.</i>
You ever see it?

1701
01:57:25,718 --> 01:57:27,960
You saw me with Marlon Brando?

1702
01:57:28,054 --> 01:57:29,174
You know, we're good friends.

1703
01:57:29,263 --> 01:57:30,424
I was his driver.

1704
01:57:30,515 --> 01:57:31,631
No shit?

1705
01:57:31,766 --> 01:57:32,847
Brando.

1706
01:57:32,934 --> 01:57:35,802
They shot it there.
Cartagena.

1707
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:38,102
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

1708
01:57:38,231 --> 01:57:39,312
Italian guy.

1709
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,227
Tell me about him.

1710
01:57:41,317 --> 01:57:43,104
I also know Paul Newman.

1711
01:57:43,569 --> 01:57:44,630
I worked with him in Tucson.

1712
01:57:44,654 --> 01:57:45,654
No kidding?

1713
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:48,614
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

1714
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:50,657
In Tucson.
Benny Alvarez?

1715
01:57:50,743 --> 01:57:52,029
Subtotal.

1716
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:53,452
No?

1717
01:57:56,124 --> 01:57:57,581
He's a nice guy.

1718
01:57:58,126 --> 01:58:02,120
$283,107.65.

1719
01:58:04,966 --> 01:58:06,958
You want a company check here?

1720
01:58:08,428 --> 01:58:12,342
I got 284.6.

1721
01:58:12,473 --> 01:58:14,305
That's just not possible.

1722
01:58:14,392 --> 01:58:15,928
The machine don't make mistakes.

1723
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,561
Let's count it again.

1724
01:58:20,648 --> 01:58:21,648
No. Come on.

1725
01:58:21,774 --> 01:58:23,561
Business is business.
Come on.

1726
01:58:23,651 --> 01:58:25,142
You're talking $1,500 here.

1727
01:58:26,195 --> 01:58:29,313
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1728
01:58:31,117 --> 01:58:32,177
I'll count it again for you.

1729
01:58:32,201 --> 01:58:33,362
No, come on.

1730
01:58:33,494 --> 01:58:36,282
This check here,
where does this check go?

1731
01:58:39,667 --> 01:58:41,078
Montana Realty Company.

1732
01:58:41,169 --> 01:58:42,169
Montana what?

1733
01:58:42,628 --> 01:58:44,290
Montana Realty Company.

1734
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:48,124
Montana Realty Company.

1735
01:58:48,342 --> 01:58:49,958
That's 284.

1736
01:58:50,052 --> 01:58:52,009
284,600.

1737
01:58:52,972 --> 01:58:55,464
How come you don't
know Benny Alvarez?

1738
01:58:55,558 --> 01:58:57,766
Me and Benny have lunch together.

1739
01:58:57,852 --> 01:59:00,014
He probably knows me.

1740
01:59:00,563 --> 01:59:02,145
You ask him.

1741
01:59:20,166 --> 01:59:21,702
We're up to what?

1742
01:59:23,252 --> 01:59:29,374
Seven checks.
$1,325,623.

1743
01:59:32,178 --> 01:59:34,215
200,000 more.

1744
01:59:34,347 --> 01:59:35,428
We ought to take a leak.

1745
01:59:35,515 --> 01:59:36,515
Freeze!

1746
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:37,931
Get your hands up!

1747
01:59:38,059 --> 01:59:39,595
Go against the wall, turn around.

1748
01:59:39,727 --> 01:59:40,727
You're not kidding.

1749
01:59:40,853 --> 01:59:44,017
You're under arrest for
violation of the RICO Statute.

1750
01:59:44,106 --> 01:59:45,768
You have the right to remain silent.

1751
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:48,438
Anything you say can and
will be taken against you.

1752
01:59:48,569 --> 01:59:50,276
How do I know you guys are cops?

1753
01:59:50,363 --> 01:59:52,025
What's that say, asshole?

1754
01:59:53,449 --> 01:59:56,442
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1755
01:59:56,577 --> 01:59:57,988
You call yourself a Cuban?

1756
01:59:58,079 --> 01:59:59,911
You make a real Cuban throw up!

1757
02:00:00,039 --> 02:00:02,201
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

1758
02:00:02,583 --> 02:00:03,915
I want to call my lawyer.

1759
02:00:04,001 --> 02:00:05,742
Lot of good he's gonna do you.

1760
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,128
You see that eye
there in the clock?

1761
02:00:08,464 --> 02:00:10,421
Say, "Hi, honey."

1762
02:00:11,467 --> 02:00:13,504
<i>That's pretty cute.
Look at that.</i>

1763
02:00:13,594 --> 02:00:15,802
<i>You jerk off in front of us,
Seidelbaum?</i>

1764
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:18,217
<i>I was supposed
to meet this chick at 3:00.</i>

1765
02:00:18,307 --> 02:00:20,139
<i>You're a fucking pain in the ass.</i>

1766
02:00:20,476 --> 02:00:22,263
<i>All right, Benny, kill it.</i>

1767
02:00:23,271 --> 02:00:25,809
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1768
02:00:25,982 --> 02:00:28,144
I know all that bullshit, Seidelbaum!

1769
02:00:28,276 --> 02:00:29,608
Save your breath.

1770
02:00:29,944 --> 02:00:32,652
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1771
02:00:33,155 --> 02:00:35,488
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

1772
02:00:35,867 --> 02:00:39,281
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

1773
02:00:39,954 --> 02:00:43,823
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer

1774
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:48,210
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

1775
02:00:49,964 --> 02:00:51,296
So dress warm.

1776
02:00:55,344 --> 02:00:59,429
<i>Give me a check
for 100 grand, plus 300 in cash.</i>

1777
02:00:59,974 --> 02:01:02,717
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1778
02:01:03,644 --> 02:01:06,637
They're gonna come back
at us on a tax evasion,

1779
02:01:07,732 --> 02:01:09,519
and they'll get it.

1780
02:01:13,487 --> 02:01:15,820
So, what am I looking at here?

1781
02:01:18,075 --> 02:01:20,283
Five years.
You'll be out in three.

1782
02:01:20,369 --> 02:01:23,032
Maybe less, if I can make a deal.

1783
02:01:24,665 --> 02:01:26,201
Three fucking years!

1784
02:01:28,586 --> 02:01:29,872
For what?

1785
02:01:30,922 --> 02:01:32,788
Washing money?

1786
02:01:32,882 --> 02:01:34,484
The fucking country was
built on washed money.

1787
02:01:34,508 --> 02:01:35,874
Can't be that bad.

1788
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:37,091
It's not like Cuba.

1789
02:01:37,178 --> 02:01:38,419
What the fuck you talking?

1790
02:01:38,512 --> 02:01:40,253
The jails are like hotels.

1791
02:01:40,348 --> 02:01:41,714
You kidding me or what?

1792
02:01:41,849 --> 02:01:43,260
You fucking high or what?

1793
02:01:43,351 --> 02:01:44,683
I'll delay the trial.

1794
02:01:44,894 --> 02:01:47,978
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1795
02:01:48,064 --> 02:01:49,225
Fuck you, man!

1796
02:01:49,357 --> 02:01:51,314
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1797
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,232
No way. I been there.

1798
02:01:58,866 --> 02:02:00,232
Okay, look.

1799
02:02:02,536 --> 02:02:06,780
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1800
02:02:07,249 --> 02:02:10,413
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1801
02:02:13,047 --> 02:02:16,540
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1802
02:02:17,468 --> 02:02:19,881
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.

1803
02:02:19,971 --> 02:02:21,633
But when you got 1.3 million

1804
02:02:21,764 --> 02:02:24,973
undeclared staring into
a videotape camera,

1805
02:02:25,643 --> 02:02:27,976
honey baby,
it's hard to convince a jury

1806
02:02:28,062 --> 02:02:29,644
you found it in a taxicab.

1807
02:02:53,254 --> 02:02:55,792
I'm so glad you could
come on such short notice.

1808
02:02:55,923 --> 02:02:57,004
I really appreciate it.

1809
02:02:57,091 --> 02:02:58,798
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

1810
02:02:59,093 --> 02:03:01,005
Oh, great.
How's your wife?

1811
02:03:01,095 --> 02:03:02,176
Three more months.

1812
02:03:02,346 --> 02:03:03,507
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.

1813
02:03:03,597 --> 02:03:04,758
How about you?

1814
02:03:04,849 --> 02:03:07,557
When you gonna have another
Tony to take your place?

1815
02:03:07,643 --> 02:03:08,724
I'm working on it.

1816
02:03:08,811 --> 02:03:10,643
You have to work harder. Come.

1817
02:03:10,813 --> 02:03:13,180
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

1818
02:03:18,112 --> 02:03:19,398
This is Pedro Quinn,

1819
02:03:19,488 --> 02:03:21,480
chairman of the Andes
Sugar Corporation.

1820
02:03:21,615 --> 02:03:22,901
Pleasure meeting you.

1821
02:03:22,992 --> 02:03:24,073
Nice to meet you.

1822
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:27,528
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

1823
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,247
Pleasure.

1824
02:03:30,332 --> 02:03:32,369
This is Ariel Bleyer,

1825
02:03:32,501 --> 02:03:35,460
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1826
02:03:37,631 --> 02:03:41,545
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.

1827
02:03:41,844 --> 02:03:42,880
Nice to meet you.

1828
02:03:42,970 --> 02:03:44,461
How do you do, Mr. Montana?

1829
02:03:45,514 --> 02:03:47,005
Sit here, Tony.

1830
02:03:50,811 --> 02:03:52,052
Gentlemen.

1831
02:03:55,983 --> 02:03:57,895
I would like to discuss something

1832
02:03:57,985 --> 02:03:59,977
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1833
02:04:01,322 --> 02:04:03,029
You have a problem, Tony.

1834
02:04:03,866 --> 02:04:07,075
We have a problem.

1835
02:04:08,245 --> 02:04:10,988
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

1836
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:15,788
We all know you have tax
troubles in your country

1837
02:04:15,878 --> 02:04:18,586
and that you may have
to do a little time.

1838
02:04:19,215 --> 02:04:20,797
We have friends in Washington

1839
02:04:20,883 --> 02:04:23,967
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1840
02:04:24,053 --> 02:04:27,592
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine,

1841
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:30,507
but there will be no prison.

1842
02:04:31,185 --> 02:04:32,185
Okay.

1843
02:04:33,104 --> 02:04:35,061
So what's your problem, Alex?

1844
02:04:36,107 --> 02:04:37,894
I'll show you my problem.

1845
02:04:38,442 --> 02:04:41,606
<i>I've heard about financial
support your government receives</i>

1846
02:04:41,695 --> 02:04:43,527
<i>from the drug industry in Bolivia.</i>

1847
02:04:43,614 --> 02:04:46,903
<i>Well, the irony of this
is that this money,</i>

1848
02:04:47,034 --> 02:04:48,525
<i>which is in the billions,</i>

1849
02:04:48,744 --> 02:04:50,485
<i>is coming from your country.</i>

1850
02:04:50,579 --> 02:04:54,414
<i>You are the major purchaser
of our national product,</i>

1851
02:04:54,542 --> 02:04:56,283
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

1852
02:04:56,377 --> 02:04:58,688
<i>On one hand,
you're saying the U.S. government</i>

1853
02:04:58,712 --> 02:05:00,829
<i>is spending millions to eliminate</i>

1854
02:05:00,923 --> 02:05:03,040
<i>the flow of drugs onto our streets.</i>

1855
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,916
<i>At the same time,</i>

1856
02:05:05,052 --> 02:05:07,886
<i>we are doing business
with the same government</i>

1857
02:05:08,097 --> 02:05:10,635
<i>that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.</i>

1858
02:05:10,975 --> 02:05:13,558
<i>Let me show you a few
of the other characters</i>

1859
02:05:13,644 --> 02:05:15,886
<i>that are involved
in this tragic comedy.</i>

1860
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:18,393
<i>My organization just recently traced</i>

1861
02:05:18,482 --> 02:05:21,270
<i>a large purchase by this man.</i>

1862
02:05:21,944 --> 02:05:25,563
<i>This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

1863
02:05:25,823 --> 02:05:29,066
<i>He is the Minister of the
Defense of Bolivia, my country.</i>

1864
02:05:29,577 --> 02:05:31,990
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago</i>

1865
02:05:32,079 --> 02:05:36,915
<i>bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

1866
02:05:37,418 --> 02:05:38,728
<i>Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be</i>

1867
02:05:38,752 --> 02:05:39,912
<i>the Bolivian Defense Minister,</i>

1868
02:05:39,962 --> 02:05:42,204
<i>what is he doing
living in Switzerland?</i>

1869
02:05:42,298 --> 02:05:43,789
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

1870
02:05:44,925 --> 02:05:47,884
<i>This man here, Alejandro Sosa,</i>

1871
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:49,256
<i>a very interesting character.</i>

1872
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:51,133
<i>He's a wealthy landowner,</i>

1873
02:05:51,265 --> 02:05:53,803
<i>educated in England,
very good family.</i>

1874
02:05:54,101 --> 02:05:58,095
<i>But this man is the business
brain and drug overlord</i>

1875
02:05:58,355 --> 02:06:01,098
<i>of an empire that
stretches across the Andes.</i>

1876
02:06:01,192 --> 02:06:03,775
<i>He's not your ordinary drug dealer.</i>

1877
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,357
<i>Well,
discussing it openly...</i>

1878
02:06:08,115 --> 02:06:10,528
He's scheduled for <i>60 Minutes</i> next.

1879
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:16,659
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1880
02:06:17,249 --> 02:06:20,162
People everywhere are
starting to listen to him.

1881
02:06:20,628 --> 02:06:22,335
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1882
02:06:24,548 --> 02:06:26,835
That is our problem.

1883
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:31,712
You remember Alberto, don't you?

1884
02:06:33,057 --> 02:06:34,764
How could I forget him?

1885
02:06:35,476 --> 02:06:38,844
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1886
02:06:39,855 --> 02:06:42,222
He's going to help
us fix our problem.

1887
02:06:44,026 --> 02:06:45,983
But he doesn't speak English.

1888
02:06:46,737 --> 02:06:49,730
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1889
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:51,947
He needs a little help.

1890
02:06:54,161 --> 02:06:56,073
Is that a problem, Tony?

1891
02:07:02,002 --> 02:07:03,618
No problem.

1892
02:07:06,173 --> 02:07:07,289
Good.

1893
02:07:22,606 --> 02:07:26,600
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1894
02:07:26,986 --> 02:07:29,979
You gonna tell me what
happened with Sosa, or what?

1895
02:07:30,197 --> 02:07:33,486
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

1896
02:07:34,368 --> 02:07:35,529
Politics.

1897
02:07:40,332 --> 02:07:43,621
I want you to stay
down here for a while.

1898
02:07:44,837 --> 02:07:46,544
Run things for me.

1899
02:07:47,298 --> 02:07:49,460
I gotta go to New York next week.

1900
02:07:55,806 --> 02:07:57,047
Fuck this, man.

1901
02:07:57,182 --> 02:08:00,050
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

1902
02:08:00,185 --> 02:08:01,847
You don't like it?

1903
02:08:04,898 --> 02:08:08,141
You got me into this
mess in the first place.

1904
02:08:08,235 --> 02:08:11,979
With that fucking
Seidelbaum, that right?

1905
02:08:12,072 --> 02:08:13,404
With Seidelbaum?

1906
02:08:13,532 --> 02:08:15,740
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

1907
02:08:15,826 --> 02:08:18,569
How do you connect those two?

1908
02:08:18,996 --> 02:08:21,579
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

1909
02:08:21,707 --> 02:08:23,744
I'm not hungry.

1910
02:08:24,418 --> 02:08:25,499
You're not hungry?

1911
02:08:25,586 --> 02:08:27,418
Do you even know about the trial?

1912
02:08:27,588 --> 02:08:29,295
What did you order it for, then?

1913
02:08:29,381 --> 02:08:31,714
I lost my appetite.

1914
02:08:36,889 --> 02:08:38,425
Do you even know
that Sheffield said

1915
02:08:38,515 --> 02:08:40,677
he can get you a postponement?

1916
02:08:48,067 --> 02:08:52,232
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

1917
02:08:55,449 --> 02:08:58,863
Eating, drinking,

1918
02:08:59,370 --> 02:09:01,532
fucking, sucking...

1919
02:09:01,622 --> 02:09:02,954
Come on, man.

1920
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:04,372
Snorting?

1921
02:09:04,458 --> 02:09:05,619
Then what?

1922
02:09:07,294 --> 02:09:09,126
Tell me. Then what?

1923
02:09:10,089 --> 02:09:14,584
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

1924
02:09:15,969 --> 02:09:18,757
You got tits, you need a bra.

1925
02:09:19,598 --> 02:09:21,134
They got hair on them.

1926
02:09:22,393 --> 02:09:25,727
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it

1927
02:09:25,813 --> 02:09:27,896
and you're eating this fucking shit

1928
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:31,938
and you're looking like these
rich fucking mummies in here.

1929
02:09:32,152 --> 02:09:34,815
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

1930
02:09:35,489 --> 02:09:36,821
Is this what it's all about?

1931
02:09:36,907 --> 02:09:37,988
Forget it.

1932
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:41,151
This what I work for?
Tell me.

1933
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:47,991
Look at that.

1934
02:09:49,086 --> 02:09:50,418
A junkie.

1935
02:09:52,172 --> 02:09:56,542
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

1936
02:09:57,719 --> 02:10:01,508
Sleeps all day with
them black shades on.

1937
02:10:03,183 --> 02:10:04,469
Wakes up with a Quaalude...

1938
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:05,846
Don't pick on her, man.

1939
02:10:05,978 --> 02:10:09,688
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

1940
02:10:11,358 --> 02:10:13,771
I can't even have a kid with her.

1941
02:10:13,861 --> 02:10:16,569
Her womb is so polluted,

1942
02:10:16,697 --> 02:10:19,656
I can't even have a fucking
little baby with her!

1943
02:10:19,741 --> 02:10:22,074
You son of a bitch!

1944
02:10:23,036 --> 02:10:24,698
You fuck!

1945
02:10:25,038 --> 02:10:26,449
You shouldn't talk like that.

1946
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:28,748
How dare you talk to me like that!

1947
02:10:30,043 --> 02:10:32,410
What makes you so
much better than me?

1948
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,166
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

1949
02:10:34,256 --> 02:10:36,498
You deal drugs and you kill people.

1950
02:10:36,592 --> 02:10:37,878
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.

1951
02:10:38,552 --> 02:10:40,885
Real contribution to human history.

1952
02:10:41,013 --> 02:10:42,379
Go ahead.
Tell everybody.

1953
02:10:42,473 --> 02:10:43,805
You want a kid?

1954
02:10:43,891 --> 02:10:45,223
Tell the world.

1955
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:48,218
What kind of a father
would you make?

1956
02:10:49,563 --> 02:10:52,021
Gonna drive him to
school in the mornings?

1957
02:10:52,107 --> 02:10:55,726
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

1958
02:10:57,237 --> 02:10:59,103
You don't know how to be a husband!

1959
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:00,198
Sit down before I...

1960
02:11:00,282 --> 02:11:02,774
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs

1961
02:11:02,910 --> 02:11:04,572
hanging around all the time?

1962
02:11:04,953 --> 02:11:08,697
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

1963
02:11:10,209 --> 02:11:13,202
What kind of life is that?

1964
02:11:17,633 --> 02:11:19,090
Can't you see

1965
02:11:21,428 --> 02:11:24,136
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

1966
02:11:25,098 --> 02:11:27,385
We're not winners, we're losers.

1967
02:11:28,393 --> 02:11:30,134
Go home.
You're stoned.

1968
02:11:30,229 --> 02:11:32,437
I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

1969
02:11:32,731 --> 02:11:33,812
Get her out of here.

1970
02:11:33,899 --> 02:11:35,106
Come on.

1971
02:11:37,486 --> 02:11:39,398
I'm not going home with you.

1972
02:11:40,906 --> 02:11:42,943
I'm not going home with anybody.

1973
02:11:44,785 --> 02:11:46,321
I'm going home alone.

1974
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,332
I'm leaving you.

1975
02:11:55,837 --> 02:11:57,829
I don't need this shit anymore.

1976
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:00,127
Okay, but I'll walk you out.

1977
02:12:00,217 --> 02:12:01,424
I'll take her home in a cab.

1978
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:03,752
Let her go.

1979
02:12:04,346 --> 02:12:07,180
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

1980
02:12:14,731 --> 02:12:16,313
What're you looking at?

1981
02:12:23,282 --> 02:12:25,649
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

1982
02:12:26,994 --> 02:12:28,485
You know why?

1983
02:12:30,372 --> 02:12:33,615
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

1984
02:12:37,170 --> 02:12:39,503
You need people like me.

1985
02:12:45,178 --> 02:12:46,714
You need people like me

1986
02:12:46,805 --> 02:12:49,513
so you can point
your fucking fingers

1987
02:12:50,058 --> 02:12:52,391
and say, "That's the bad guy."

1988
02:12:55,355 --> 02:12:59,099
So, what does that make you?

1989
02:12:59,735 --> 02:13:00,771
Good?

1990
02:13:03,655 --> 02:13:05,396
You're not good.

1991
02:13:07,618 --> 02:13:09,530
You just know how to hide,

1992
02:13:11,246 --> 02:13:12,532
how to lie.

1993
02:13:15,208 --> 02:13:18,622
Me, I don't have that problem.

1994
02:13:20,339 --> 02:13:23,548
Me, I always tell the truth.

1995
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:26,967
Even when I lie.

1996
02:13:36,146 --> 02:13:38,684
So say good night to the bad guy!

1997
02:13:39,316 --> 02:13:40,557
Come on.

1998
02:13:42,778 --> 02:13:45,646
The last time you gonna see
a bad guy like this again,

1999
02:13:45,739 --> 02:13:47,105
let me tell you.

2000
02:13:48,325 --> 02:13:51,693
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

2001
02:13:53,163 --> 02:13:55,655
There's a bad guy coming through!

2002
02:13:56,416 --> 02:13:58,078
Better get out of his way!

2003
02:15:25,589 --> 02:15:29,299
No. You tell
Sheffield to keep his nose out of it.

2004
02:15:29,509 --> 02:15:30,841
There's gonna be no trial.

2005
02:15:30,927 --> 02:15:32,839
I got it all under control now.

2006
02:15:33,263 --> 02:15:35,346
Just tell him to stay out of it!

2007
02:15:35,891 --> 02:15:38,304
Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?

2008
02:15:41,688 --> 02:15:43,099
Yeah, all right.

2009
02:15:58,538 --> 02:16:00,279
Tony, everything go okay?

2010
02:16:00,624 --> 02:16:02,411
Yeah, everything is roses.

2011
02:16:06,296 --> 02:16:08,128
Ernie, what time do you got?

2012
02:16:08,298 --> 02:16:10,164
Ten to.

2013
02:16:10,258 --> 02:16:11,294
Ten to.

2014
02:16:11,384 --> 02:16:12,625
Where is this guy, man?

2015
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:13,960
I gotta call Manny again.

2016
02:16:15,555 --> 02:16:17,091
You don't tell me what to do here!

2017
02:16:17,182 --> 02:16:18,182
He's coming out.

2018
02:16:18,266 --> 02:16:19,427
He's coming.

2019
02:16:20,769 --> 02:16:21,930
I don't give a fuck.

2020
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:23,136
It's him, man.

2021
02:16:30,654 --> 02:16:32,862
I don't care where you blow him up.

2022
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:34,981
Tell me when, okay?

2023
02:16:36,785 --> 02:16:39,619
You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.

2024
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,957
I heard you the first time.

2025
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:54,337
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

2026
02:16:58,223 --> 02:17:00,465
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

2027
02:17:03,103 --> 02:17:04,844
Look.
Here he comes.

2028
02:17:07,774 --> 02:17:09,857
Where's he going?

2029
02:17:10,068 --> 02:17:11,775
What's he doing that way?

2030
02:17:23,164 --> 02:17:24,826
What the fuck he doing?

2031
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:40,721
What the fuck is that?
Come here.

2032
02:17:40,807 --> 02:17:42,890
You said she took the
kids in the other car!

2033
02:17:42,976 --> 02:17:45,309
She did, every fucking day.

2034
02:17:45,395 --> 02:17:46,852
I don't know what's going on.

2035
02:17:49,274 --> 02:17:53,109
No fucking way. No fucking way.
That's it!

2036
02:18:05,749 --> 02:18:07,706
This fucking guy.

2037
02:18:44,955 --> 02:18:46,947
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

2038
02:18:51,086 --> 02:18:55,126
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

2039
02:18:55,966 --> 02:18:57,958
This is so fucking bad.

2040
02:19:01,846 --> 02:19:03,929
I see them, all right?
I see them!

2041
02:19:09,646 --> 02:19:11,228
Shut the fuck up, okay?

2042
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:27,574
You don't have the guts to look
them in the eye when you kill them.

2043
02:19:27,747 --> 02:19:29,204
You gotta hide with that shit...

2044
02:19:30,417 --> 02:19:32,124
He's getting up.
Let's do it.

2045
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:33,826
Make you feel good?

2046
02:19:34,337 --> 02:19:36,545
Make you feel good
to kill a mama and her kids?

2047
02:19:36,631 --> 02:19:37,792
Make you feel big.

2048
02:19:39,217 --> 02:19:41,083
Like you, big man!
Fuck you!

2049
02:19:41,803 --> 02:19:43,214
What do you think I am?

2050
02:19:43,304 --> 02:19:45,466
You think I kill two
kids and a woman?

2051
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:49,054
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!

2052
02:19:51,396 --> 02:19:53,353
You die, motherfucker!

2053
02:19:58,319 --> 02:19:59,810
What do you think I am, huh?

2054
02:19:59,904 --> 02:20:02,066
You think I'm a
fucking worm like you?

2055
02:20:02,365 --> 02:20:05,904
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

2056
02:20:06,119 --> 02:20:08,406
I told you, no fucking kids!

2057
02:20:08,538 --> 02:20:10,120
No, but you wouldn't listen!

2058
02:20:10,206 --> 02:20:12,664
You stupid fuck!
Look at you now.

2059
02:20:18,173 --> 02:20:20,460
Nick, where the fuck you been?

2060
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:23,171
On a delivery?

2061
02:20:24,012 --> 02:20:25,969
Where the hell is Manny?

2062
02:20:26,056 --> 02:20:27,922
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

2063
02:20:28,016 --> 02:20:30,429
I don't know, Tony.

2064
02:20:30,518 --> 02:20:32,350
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

2065
02:20:32,437 --> 02:20:33,644
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>

2066
02:20:33,730 --> 02:20:34,891
He's gone?
What? Where?

2067
02:20:34,981 --> 02:20:38,895
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

2068
02:20:39,027 --> 02:20:41,360
You can't trust nobody anymore!

2069
02:20:41,446 --> 02:20:44,860
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

2070
02:20:44,949 --> 02:20:46,065
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>

2071
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:47,195
He took off?

2072
02:20:47,994 --> 02:20:49,235
<i>Are you all right?</i>

2073
02:20:49,329 --> 02:20:51,366
No, I'm not all right!
I'm pissed!

2074
02:20:51,456 --> 02:20:52,617
When I get back there,

2075
02:20:52,707 --> 02:20:54,744
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

2076
02:20:54,834 --> 02:20:56,245
<i>When you coming back?</i>

2077
02:20:56,336 --> 02:20:57,668
I'm coming back tonight!

2078
02:20:58,004 --> 02:21:00,087
This fucking cocksucker.

2079
02:21:00,715 --> 02:21:05,085
Tony, your mama called.
Gina's gone.

2080
02:21:06,888 --> 02:21:08,129
Gone? Where?

2081
02:21:08,223 --> 02:21:10,089
<i>She got to see you right away.</i>

2082
02:21:10,183 --> 02:21:13,893
Tell her I'll call her tonight.

2083
02:21:14,104 --> 02:21:17,268
Listen to me. What about Elvie?
She call?

2084
02:21:17,398 --> 02:21:18,514
<i>No.</i>

2085
02:21:18,608 --> 02:21:19,689
No.

2086
02:21:19,776 --> 02:21:21,517
Okay, listen to me.

2087
02:21:21,611 --> 02:21:23,944
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

2088
02:21:24,030 --> 02:21:26,192
Okay?
Just tell her that.

2089
02:21:50,014 --> 02:21:51,846
- You hear from Manny?
- No.

2090
02:21:51,933 --> 02:21:53,799
Your mama called,
she gotta see you.

2091
02:21:53,893 --> 02:21:58,012
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

2092
02:21:58,106 --> 02:21:59,813
Get him on the phone.
Elvie call?

2093
02:21:59,899 --> 02:22:00,899
No.

2094
02:22:03,945 --> 02:22:06,904
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

2095
02:22:06,990 --> 02:22:08,071
I want him here now!
Okay?

2096
02:22:08,158 --> 02:22:09,194
Okay.

2097
02:22:09,284 --> 02:22:12,448
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

2098
02:22:27,135 --> 02:22:31,550
Yeah? Mama.
Yeah, I know.

2099
02:22:32,473 --> 02:22:35,136
They told me.

2100
02:22:35,226 --> 02:22:37,183
Okay. I'm coming over.

2101
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:41,935
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

2102
02:22:44,235 --> 02:22:46,192
Put it on the speaker.

2103
02:22:56,247 --> 02:22:58,364
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

2104
02:22:59,334 --> 02:23:00,745
Alex, how you doing?

2105
02:23:00,835 --> 02:23:02,246
<i>What happened?</i>

2106
02:23:02,587 --> 02:23:04,920
Oh, we had some problems.

2107
02:23:07,175 --> 02:23:08,175
Alex?

2108
02:23:08,259 --> 02:23:09,591
<i>Tony, what happened?</i>

2109
02:23:13,097 --> 02:23:14,213
We had a little problem.

2110
02:23:14,307 --> 02:23:15,343
<i>I heard.</i>

2111
02:23:15,433 --> 02:23:16,594
How you hear that?

2112
02:23:16,684 --> 02:23:18,846
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

2113
02:23:18,937 --> 02:23:21,896
He was not supposed
to give that speech.

2114
02:23:24,192 --> 02:23:27,526
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

2115
02:23:27,612 --> 02:23:29,854
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen,

2116
02:23:29,948 --> 02:23:31,439
so I canceled his contract.

2117
02:23:31,532 --> 02:23:33,990
My partners and I are pissed off.

2118
02:23:34,535 --> 02:23:36,322
That's okay.
No big deal.

2119
02:23:36,537 --> 02:23:39,575
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

2120
02:23:39,832 --> 02:23:41,869
No, Tony, you can't do that.

2121
02:23:42,418 --> 02:23:45,411
They found what was under the car.

2122
02:23:46,297 --> 02:23:48,960
Now our friend has got
security up the ass.

2123
02:23:49,259 --> 02:23:52,798
<i>The heat will come down hard
on my partners and me.</i>

2124
02:23:53,596 --> 02:23:55,553
There's not gonna be a next time,

2125
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:57,472
<i>you dumb cocksucker!
You blew it!</i>

2126
02:23:57,558 --> 02:23:59,345
Take it easy when you talk to me.

2127
02:23:59,477 --> 02:24:04,313
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

2128
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:06,356
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to, huh?

2129
02:24:06,442 --> 02:24:07,649
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

2130
02:24:08,027 --> 02:24:11,441
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

2131
02:24:12,115 --> 02:24:15,028
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

2132
02:24:16,786 --> 02:24:19,199
Alex, you there? Hey!

2133
02:24:19,289 --> 02:24:22,748
He's not there.
<i>Cálmate,</i> man.

2134
02:24:24,168 --> 02:24:28,037
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

2135
02:24:28,256 --> 02:24:30,589
One night, I follow her in a taxi.

2136
02:24:30,717 --> 02:24:33,380
She goes to a fancy
house in Coconut Grove.

2137
02:24:34,429 --> 02:24:36,216
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

2138
02:24:36,347 --> 02:24:37,713
You were giving her the money!

2139
02:24:37,849 --> 02:24:39,306
You see what you do to her?

2140
02:24:39,392 --> 02:24:40,619
I don't give her that much money.

2141
02:24:40,643 --> 02:24:41,759
You did!

2142
02:24:41,894 --> 02:24:43,681
One time, $1,000 you gave her.

2143
02:24:43,771 --> 02:24:45,012
Was a guy with her?

2144
02:24:45,732 --> 02:24:47,689
I don't know.

2145
02:24:47,942 --> 02:24:50,150
There was this car in the driveway.

2146
02:24:50,236 --> 02:24:51,977
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

2147
02:24:52,071 --> 02:24:53,107
She's like you.

2148
02:24:53,197 --> 02:24:54,859
Where's the place?
Where is it?

2149
02:24:55,074 --> 02:24:58,033
400 something...

2150
02:24:58,119 --> 02:24:59,280
Citrus Drive.

2151
02:24:59,412 --> 02:25:01,745
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

2152
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:05,204
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

2153
02:25:05,293 --> 02:25:07,125
She says to me, <i>"Mira,</i> shut up!

2154
02:25:07,253 --> 02:25:08,460
"Mind your own business."

2155
02:25:08,588 --> 02:25:10,420
Exactly like you do to me.

2156
02:25:10,548 --> 02:25:13,291
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

2157
02:25:13,426 --> 02:25:14,507
I gotta go.

2158
02:25:14,594 --> 02:25:16,085
Why do you have to hurt everything?

2159
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:18,212
Why do you have to destroy

2160
02:25:18,306 --> 02:25:20,593
everything that comes your way?

2161
02:25:24,645 --> 02:25:26,011
409 Citrus Drive.

2162
02:25:26,105 --> 02:25:27,141
Okay.

2163
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:29,477
Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.

2164
02:25:29,567 --> 02:25:30,603
Fuck!

2165
02:25:30,985 --> 02:25:33,773
Okay. Listen, boss,
I'll try again.

2166
02:26:06,813 --> 02:26:10,102
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

2167
02:26:56,362 --> 02:26:57,478
Tony.

2168
02:28:09,602 --> 02:28:12,436
We got married just yesterday.

2169
02:28:12,522 --> 02:28:14,229
We were gonna surprise you.

2170
02:28:19,946 --> 02:28:21,437
Jesus, Tony.

2171
02:28:21,948 --> 02:28:24,110
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.

2172
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:25,407
We gotta get outta here.

2173
02:28:25,952 --> 02:28:27,614
Go get Gina.

2174
02:28:35,795 --> 02:28:36,956
No!

2175
02:28:43,636 --> 02:28:46,504
No, Gina.
Come on, Gina. No!

2176
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:48,255
God!

2177
02:28:56,607 --> 02:28:58,314
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

2178
02:28:58,442 --> 02:29:00,308
We gotta get out of here.

2179
02:29:40,192 --> 02:29:41,558
Come on, Gina.

2180
02:29:45,197 --> 02:29:47,405
Here we go.
It's gonna be okay.

2181
02:29:47,533 --> 02:29:49,650
- You got her?
- I got her.

2182
02:30:17,063 --> 02:30:20,932
No! This is Tony's place!
Let me go!

2183
02:31:05,945 --> 02:31:07,436
We put some pills into her.

2184
02:31:07,530 --> 02:31:08,862
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

2185
02:31:08,948 --> 02:31:10,655
She's cooling down.
Right?

2186
02:31:10,741 --> 02:31:12,528
She's gonna be fine.
Just fine.

2187
02:31:12,618 --> 02:31:13,699
Right.

2188
02:31:16,330 --> 02:31:18,162
What are we gonna do now?

2189
02:31:22,628 --> 02:31:23,835
Do?

2190
02:31:28,676 --> 02:31:30,338
We're going to war.

2191
02:31:31,554 --> 02:31:33,716
That's what we're gonna do.

2192
02:31:37,268 --> 02:31:40,352
We're gonna eat that
Sosa for breakfast!

2193
02:31:42,690 --> 02:31:45,307
Close that fucker down.

2194
02:31:51,198 --> 02:31:53,235
Tony, take it easy.

2195
02:32:00,958 --> 02:32:02,165
All right, Ernie.
Let's go.

2196
02:32:02,251 --> 02:32:04,288
We'll take care of the house.

2197
02:33:15,324 --> 02:33:17,190
Come on.

2198
02:33:17,284 --> 02:33:19,776
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

2199
02:33:36,554 --> 02:33:39,467
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.

2200
02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:51,062
We gotta get organized here.

2201
02:34:02,246 --> 02:34:05,489
Fuck! Manny.

2202
02:34:12,298 --> 02:34:14,290
How the fuck I do that?

2203
02:34:18,429 --> 02:34:20,842
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

2204
02:35:32,336 --> 02:35:33,452
Tony.

2205
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:43,680
Gina.

2206
02:36:01,115 --> 02:36:03,232
Is this what you want, Tony?

2207
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:17,333
You can't stand for another
man to be touching me.

2208
02:36:19,758 --> 02:36:21,624
So you want me, Tony, huh?

2209
02:36:22,511 --> 02:36:23,592
Huh?

2210
02:36:25,389 --> 02:36:26,880
What are you talking about?

2211
02:36:27,016 --> 02:36:28,427
Ah.

2212
02:36:28,517 --> 02:36:29,974
Is that it?

2213
02:36:33,856 --> 02:36:35,222
Here I am, Tony.

2214
02:36:40,195 --> 02:36:42,403
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

2215
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:46,816
I'm all yours now.

2216
02:36:47,786 --> 02:36:48,786
Gina.

2217
02:36:49,538 --> 02:36:51,780
You better come and get me now.

2218
02:36:52,708 --> 02:36:54,620
- All right. Come on.
- Come and get me.

2219
02:36:54,710 --> 02:36:56,167
Come and get me.

2220
02:36:57,171 --> 02:36:59,083
You do it now before it's too late.

2221
02:37:02,634 --> 02:37:03,841
Oh, come on, Tony.

2222
02:37:06,013 --> 02:37:07,174
Fuck me.

2223
02:37:11,226 --> 02:37:13,639
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

2224
02:37:30,537 --> 02:37:31,573
Die!

2225
02:37:45,719 --> 02:37:48,427
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

2226
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:58,940
Gina.

2227
02:38:11,829 --> 02:38:15,994
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

2228
02:38:33,559 --> 02:38:35,141
Please talk to me.

2229
02:38:36,979 --> 02:38:38,515
Don't be mad at me.

2230
02:38:38,772 --> 02:38:42,106
Please. Gina, come on.

2231
02:38:43,902 --> 02:38:47,566
I love Manny, you know?

2232
02:38:47,906 --> 02:38:49,147
I love him.

2233
02:38:51,201 --> 02:38:53,693
And I love you, too, you know?

2234
02:39:20,439 --> 02:39:21,725
Give me a smile.

2235
02:39:21,815 --> 02:39:23,181
They're coming from everywhere!

2236
02:39:23,275 --> 02:39:26,109
Tony, open up!
Open the fucking door!

2237
02:39:27,738 --> 02:39:29,730
Please! Tony!

2238
02:39:29,823 --> 02:39:31,815
Let me in, boss!
Please!

2239
02:39:32,034 --> 02:39:34,071
Tony, open the fucking door!

2240
02:39:55,974 --> 02:40:01,094
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.

2241
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:06,941
You wait for me.
I'm coming back.

2242
02:40:10,822 --> 02:40:13,235
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?

2243
02:40:17,871 --> 02:40:19,453
You're fucking with the best!

2244
02:40:24,253 --> 02:40:25,960
You want to fuck with me?

2245
02:40:27,756 --> 02:40:29,543
You cockroaches.

2246
02:40:32,886 --> 02:40:35,629
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

2247
02:40:40,435 --> 02:40:42,051
You wanna play rough?

2248
02:40:43,563 --> 02:40:45,725
Say hello to my little friend!

2249
02:40:49,069 --> 02:40:50,651
You want to play rough?

2250
02:40:51,822 --> 02:40:54,656
There! You like that?

2251
02:40:56,535 --> 02:40:57,821
You want more?

2252
02:41:04,918 --> 02:41:06,125
You whores!

2253
02:41:07,546 --> 02:41:08,662
Cowards!

2254
02:41:56,303 --> 02:41:57,794
Want to fuck with me?

2255
02:42:14,654 --> 02:42:16,395
Go ahead!

2256
02:42:17,866 --> 02:42:18,902
Come on!

2257
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:24,328
How do you like that, huh?

2258
02:42:24,581 --> 02:42:26,538
You fucking <i>maricón!</i>

2259
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:30,667
You think you can take me?

2260
02:42:30,754 --> 02:42:32,996
You need a fucking army
if you gonna take me!

2261
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:37,425
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

2262
02:42:43,266 --> 02:42:46,475
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

2263
02:42:47,396 --> 02:42:49,979
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

2264
02:42:54,194 --> 02:42:55,776
I'm still standing.

02:43:00,075 --> 02:43:02,567
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

2266
02:43:04,162 --> 02:43:06,074
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

2267
02:43:06,164 --> 02:43:07,905
You think you kill me with bullets?

2268
02:43:07,999 --> 02:43:09,991
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!

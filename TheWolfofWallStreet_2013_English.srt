One!

Two!

20
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:38,582

<i>as the head of my
own brokerage firm,</i>

28
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:56,740
<i>I made $49 million,</i>

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,316
<i>which really pissed me off because it
was three shy of a million a week.</i>

30
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:06,500
<i>No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,</i>

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,279
<i>like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.</i>

32

<i>Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.</i>

52
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,251
Okay.

53
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:10,394
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:12,047
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,065
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

56
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,525
Relax!

57
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:30,486
Just relax.

58
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,494
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

59
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:45,211
Good job.

60
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,878
You get in there safe, all right?

61
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:49,796
Till the next time, brother.

62
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,381
Till next time.

63
00:03:57,074 --> 00:04:00,235
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

64
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:05,859
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

65
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,734
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

66
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:11,579
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times
a day for my "back pain,"

67
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,527
Adderall to stay focused,

68
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:16,458
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

69
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:19,579
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

70
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,078
because it's awesome.

71
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,240
Good morning, Nathan.

72
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,544
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

73
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,926
there is one that is
my absolute favorite.

74
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,219
You see,

75
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,423
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

76
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:42,483
Able to conquer the world,

77
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,261
and eviscerate your enemies.

78
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,413
Ah!

79
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:49,691
And I'm not talking about this.

80
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,860
I'm talking about this.

81
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,748
<i>See, money doesn't just
buy you a better life,</i>

82
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,293
<i>better food, better
cars, better pussy.</i>

83
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:02,670
<i>It also makes you a better person.</i>

84
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,463
<i>You can give generously
to the church</i>

85
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:06,382
<i>or political party of your choice.</i>

86
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:09,082
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

87
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:16,627
<i>I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.</i>

88
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:19,061
<i>I'm 22 years old, newly married,</i>

89
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,596
<i>and already a
money-crazed little shit.</i>

90
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,857
<i>So what do I do?</i>

91
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,358
<i>I go to the one place on Earth</i>

92
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,807
<i>that befit my
high-minded ambitions.</i>

93
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,097
I love you.

94
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,611
<i>You are lower than pond scum.</i>

95
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,618
You got a problem with that,

96
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,407
Jordan?

97
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,667
No. No problem at all.

98
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,260
Good. Because that is what you are.

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,628
Pond scum.

100
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,221
Your job is connector,

101
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:59,098
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

102
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:02,060
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

103
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,103
And until you pass your Series 7,

104
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:06,397
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

105
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:07,674
Sit!

106
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:12,195
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

107
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:15,600
The other guy you'll be working
for, he made over a million.

108
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,533
<i>A million dollars?</i>

109
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,187
<i>I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.</i>

110
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:23,384
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,322
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

112
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,986
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

113
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:29,711
Smile and dial.

114
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,240
And don't pick up your
fucking head until 1:00.

115
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,799
Hey, fuck him.

116
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,578
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

117
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,045
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

118
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:41,753
Now did you really pitch a stock
in your job interview?

119
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:43,710
I had to do something to stand out.
Right, sir?

120
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:46,213
I fucking love that.

121
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:48,764
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:51,692
We don't start dialing at 9:30

123
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,611
because our clients are
already answering the phone.

124
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:57,239
Three. Two. One.

125
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,391
Let's fuck!

126
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:02,077
<i>You want to know
what money sounds like?</i>

127
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:04,121
<i>Go to a trading floor
on Wall Street.</i>

128
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,664
<i>"Fuck" this, "shit" that.</i>

129
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:07,165
<i>"Cunt, " "cock," "asshole. "</i>

130
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:09,459
<i>I couldn't believe how these
guys talked to each other.</i>

131
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,836
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

132
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:12,660
<i>I was hooked in seconds.</i>

133
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:15,742
<i>It was like mainlining adrenaline.</i>

134
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,248
Yeah. Fuckface, look at where
the stock's at today, huh?

135
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:20,913
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

136
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:23,499
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

137
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:28,319
You are such a fucking
douchebag, Hanna.

138
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,272
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

139
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:34,013
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

140
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:35,428
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

141
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,913
Done!

142
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,281
Time to paint the tape. Whoo!

143
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:44,811
2,000. Microsoft.
Going in the hole!

144
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:46,319
Come on.

145
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:50,111
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

146
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,792
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.

147
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:54,075
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

148
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,328
Sold!

149
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:14,803
Yeah.

150
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:23,223
Tootski?

151
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:25,295
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

152
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:28,319
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

153
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:30,780
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

154
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:33,332
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

155
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:35,084
You know howl like them.
Straight up.

156
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,795
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

157
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,254
you're gonna bring us two more.

158
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:42,591
Then two more after that
every five minutes

159
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:44,836
until one of us
passes the fuck out.

160
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:47,504
Excellent strategy, sir.

161
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,382
I'm good with water for now.

162
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:50,841
Thank you.

163
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:53,837
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

164
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:56,639
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,932
Mr. Hanna?

166
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,069
You're able to do
drugs during the day

167
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,643
and then still function,
still do your job?

168
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,032
How the fuck else would
you do this job?

169
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,026
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

170
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:10,816
Right.

171
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:13,871
Well, I got to say,
I'm incredibly excited

172
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,195
to be a part of your firm.
I mean...

173
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,751
The clients you have
are absolutely...

174
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,199
Fuck the clients.

175
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:24,035
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

176
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,205
You got a girlfriend?

177
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,883
I'm married. I have a wife.

178
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,042
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

179
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:31,428
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

180
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:32,922
Think about Teresa.

181
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,140
Name of the game.

182
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,028
Move the money from your client's
pocket into your pocket.

183
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,186
Right.

184
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:40,938
But if you make your clients money
at the same time,

185
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,387
it's advantageous to
everyone. Correct?

186
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:45,184
No.

187
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,013
Number one rule of Wall Street.

188
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:50,186
Nobody...

189
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,533
I don't care if you're Warren
Buffett or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

190
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,244
Nobody knows if a
stock is gonna go up,

191
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,246
down, sideways,
or in fucking circles.

192
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,415
- Least of all stockbrokers, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,959
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

194
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,118
Uh. Fugayzi. It's a fake.

195
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:06,964
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy,
it's a woozy, it's...

196
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,424
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

197
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:11,426
It's never landed. It is no matter.

198
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:12,886
It's not on the elemental chart.

199
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,971
It's not fucking real.

200
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:16,419
- Right?
- Right.

201
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:18,379
- Stay with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

202
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,094
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

203
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:22,190
No.

204
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,231
So if you got a client
who bought stock at 8

205
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:27,765
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

206
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,194
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

207
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,945
take his fucking
money and run home.

208
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,979
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

209
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,941
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

210
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,284
No. What do you do?

211
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,187
You get another brilliant idea.

212
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,829
A special idea.

213
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:42,332
Another "situation." Another stock

214
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,459
to reinvest his
earnings and then some.

215
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,787
And he will, every single time.

216
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:48,868
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

217
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,925
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

218
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,886
Meanwhile,
he thinks he's getting shit rich,

219
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,914
which he is, on paper.

220
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,806
But you and me, the brokers,

221
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,683
we're taking home cold hard cash

222
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:03,087
via commission, motherfucker.

223
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,761
Right.

224
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,980
That's incredible, sir.

225
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,470
I can't tell you how excited I am.

226
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,765
You should be.

227
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:14,681
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

228
00:11:14,913 --> 00:11:16,139
First of all...

229
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,227
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:21,944
Do you jerk off?

231
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:24,872
Do I... Do I jerk off?

232
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:27,242
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

233
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,656
How many times a week?

234
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:31,504
Like, um, three or four.

235
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:32,838
Three or four times, maybe five.

236
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:33,909
Gotta pump those numbers up.

237
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,217
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

238
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:40,168
I myself, I jerk off
at least twice a day.

239
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:41,847
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

240
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:44,342
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

241
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,961
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:48,631
I want to. That's not why I do it.

243
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,970
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

244
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:53,526
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

245
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,570
All day long,
decimal points, high frequencies.

246
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,722
Bang, bang, bang.

247
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:00,266
Fucking digits.

248
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,493
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

249
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:04,858
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

250
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,204
It kind of wigs some people out.

251
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,330
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right.

252
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,707
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

253
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:09,778
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:11,584
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

255
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:12,877
Done.

256
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,462
This is not a tip, this
is a prescription.

257
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:15,702
- Trust me.
- Mmm-hmm.

258
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,300
If you don't, you will
fall out of balance,

259
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,510
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

260
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,886
Or worse yet,

261
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:23,755
I've seen this happen, implode.

262
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:25,807
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

263
00:12:25,907 --> 00:12:27,017
No. No, you don't.

264
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:28,310
I'm in it for the
long run, you know?

265
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,946
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:32,230
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

267
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,322
When you get really good at it,

268
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:36,390
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

269
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,698
Second key to success
in this racket

270
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,033
is this little baby right here.

271
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,561
It's called cocaine.

272
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,994
Right.

273
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:47,954
It'll keep you sharp
between the ears.

274
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:50,030
It'll also help your
fingers dial faster.

275
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,315
And guess what?

276
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:53,234
That's good for me.

277
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:54,739
Yes, sir.

278
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,242
Revolutions. You follow?

279
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:58,387
Revolutions.

280
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,630
Keep the clients on
the Ferris wheel.

281
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,259
And it goes. The park
is open 24/7, 365,

282
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:07,294
every decade, every
goddamn century.

283
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,752
That's it.

284
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:10,629
The name of the game.

285
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,257
Halkidiki?

286
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:14,963
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

287
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,767
Come on.

288
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:34,652
We're the common denominator.

289
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:39,786
Ah.

290
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:42,123
Ah.

291
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,059
Keep it up for me.

292
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,010
<i>You've seen the echo</i>

293
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,754
<i>And the money comes in</i>

294
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,181
<i>The parade comes to town</i>

295
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:53,015
<i>Going down Broadway</i>

296
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,683
<i>It's a one-way street</i>

297
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,131
<i>Whichever way I go</i>

298
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,315
<i>The next six months,</i>

299
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,734
<i>I got to know the ins and outs
of Wall Street.</i>

300
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:07,480
<i>Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.</i>

301
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,318
Oh!

302
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,479
Oh, fuckers.

303
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,824
Oh!

304
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:25,506
<i>Then I was a licensed
broker at last,</i>

305
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:27,591
<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

306
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:32,339
<i>My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.</i>

307
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,888
I have Exxon at 86
1/4 six months ago.

308
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:44,315
Today it is trading at 36 1/2.

309
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:45,638
Mr...

310
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,947
<i>They called it Black Monday.</i>

311
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,240
<i>No shit.</i>

312
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,369
<i>By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.</i>

313
00:14:57,469 --> 00:15:00,322
<i>The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.</i>

314
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:01,790
I know your family, you know mine.

315
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,877
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

316
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,295
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

317
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:07,629
Our market's solid.

318
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:09,369
This is not something
that you want to sell.

319
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,165
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

320
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:12,301
I think you're making
a big mistake.

321
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:13,886
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

322
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:15,596
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

323
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,014
A lot of people are
gonna be calling you,

324
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,215
trying to get your dirty laundry.

325
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:19,475
We don't know what's going on here.

326
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:20,878
I know. I know.

327
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,306
Holy

328
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,226
fucking shit!

329
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:39,578
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

330
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:42,122
<i>My first shitty day as a broker.</i>

331
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:44,582
<i>Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,</i>

332
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:49,489
<i>an institution since
1899, closed its doors.</i>

333
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,923
<i>Wall Street had swallowed me up</i>

334
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:54,452
<i>and shit me right back out again.</i>

335
00:15:57,563 --> 00:16:00,056
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

336
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:01,641
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

337
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:02,808
If we needed to, I'm saying...

338
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,435
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

339
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,697
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

340
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,105
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

341
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:09,356
You're gonna be a millionaire.

342
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:11,844
That's right. Okay?
Just let me look.

343
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,141
We'll find something.

344
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:14,820
- How about this?
- What?

345
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,363
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

346
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:18,731
Stock boy. What do you think?

347
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,272
You're not gonna
work at that place.

348
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:21,369
Yeah, but, you know,
you start off...

349
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,535
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

350
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:23,627
- if you go there.
- I know.

351
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:24,870
It's sales. You work your way up,

352
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,080
you'll be a general manager.

353
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,790
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

354
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,363
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

355
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,199
You understand that nobody's
hiring stockbrokers right now?

356
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,614
You understand that?

357
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:35,285
Okay?

358
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,290
Ah. This place is.

359
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,581
- What?
- What's that say?

360
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:44,957
"Stockbrokers."

361
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:47,850
In Long Island?
Stockbrokers in Long Island?

362
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,127
Yeah.

363
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:51,297
<i>It's in Long Island. So what?</i>

364
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,115
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for Investor's Center.

365
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:16,034
What's that? You want to invest?

366
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:17,839
No. Investor's Center.

367
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,122
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

368
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:21,801
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

369
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:22,872
Oh.

370
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,512
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

371
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,506
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

372
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,129
I'm Jordan Belfort.

373
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:30,469
I'm the broker from Rothschild
in New York.

374
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:32,345
Yes, yeah. Have a seat.
How are you?

375
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:33,855
We had a conversation...

376
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,189
We spoke on the phone
earlier, right?

377
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,607
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

378
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:37,759
Yeah.

379
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:41,852
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

380
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,739
It's 3 cents a share, that's $3!

381
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,358
You cheap fuck!

382
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,242
So, uh...

383
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:50,021
So where are your Quotrons here?

384
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,247
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

385
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:53,624
No, no.
We don't even need computers here.

386
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,472
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

387
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:57,328
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

388
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,252
You know, uh, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

389
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:00,535
they don't have enough capital?

390
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:01,713
Their shares trade here.

391
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,497
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

392
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:06,468
This one, uh, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

393
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:07,927
Or Aerotyne...

394
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:09,546
Aerotyne, yeah.

395
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:11,257
Aero... Aerotyne...

396
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,641
Aerotyne. Yeah.

397
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:13,850
Very hot stock right now.

398
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,942
Oh, yeah?

399
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,227
They're just a couple of brothers
that are making

400
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:17,646
radar detectors out
of their garage.

401
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:18,738
They're out in Dubuque.

402
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,065
Maybe it's microwaves.
I'm not sure.

403
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,566
But you call the
company's main line,

404
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,485
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

405
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,487
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

406
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,658
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

407
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,063
Six cents a share?

408
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,878
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

409
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,108
Well, I mean...

410
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:35,454
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

411
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:37,569
Postmen, there's always postmen.

412
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,541
Uh, plumbers. Um...

413
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,085
They see our ads in
the back of, uh,

414
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,670
<i>Hustler and Popular Mechanics.</i>

415
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,644
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

416
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:46,882
<i>- Hustler?</i>
- Yeah.

417
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,175
You know, those girlie magazines.

418
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:49,752
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

419
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:50,928
- A lot.
- Yeah.

420
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,638
We're helping them finance houses,

421
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:54,598
we're helping them buy
their wife a diamond ring...

422
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:55,766
A boat maybe.

423
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:58,719
Is this... Is this stuff
regulated or are you guys...

424
00:18:58,819 --> 00:18:59,970
What are you doing here?

425
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:02,048
Uh...

426
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:03,849
Sort of.

427
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,093
Sort of?

428
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,279
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

429
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,656
Yeah. And that's
the point, that's...

430
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:11,824
What's your name again?

431
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:13,253
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

432
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,232
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

433
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:18,319
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

434
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,324
Pink sheets, it's 50.

435
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,488
It's 50%?

436
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,702
50% commission?

437
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:28,291
- Yup.
- For what?

438
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,667
It's our markup for our services.

439
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,428
And so if I... If I...

440
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:37,709
if I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

441
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:40,184
If you sell $10,000
worth of this stock,

442
00:19:40,284 --> 00:19:42,506
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

443
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:45,946
And I hope it happens.

444
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,009
<i>Hello, John,
how are you doing today?</i>

445
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:52,653
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

446
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:54,447
requesting information
on penny stocks

447
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:56,574
that had huge upside potential

448
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:58,325
with very little downside risk.

449
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,327
- Does that ring a bell?
<i>- Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

450
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:03,539
Okay, great. The reason for
the call today, John, is,

451
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,280
something just came
across my desk, John.

452
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,668
It is perhaps the best thing

453
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:09,170
I've seen in the last six months.

454
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,046
If you have 60 seconds,
I'd like to share

455
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:12,339
the idea with you.
You got a minute?

456
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,466
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

457
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:16,010
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

458
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,415
It is a cutting edge high-tech firm
out of the Midwest

459
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:21,432
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i>

460
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,018
on the next generation
of radar detectors

461
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:28,635
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

462
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,023
Right now, John,

463
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:32,484
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

464
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:34,861
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

465
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,238
it could go a heck of
a lot higher than that.

466
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:40,283
Your profit on a mere
$6,000 investment

467
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:43,358
would be upwards of $60,000!

468
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:44,913
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i>

469
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:46,581
Exactly.
You could pay off your mortgage.

470
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,166
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i>

471
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,043
John, one thing I can promise you,

472
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:51,369
even in this market,

473
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:53,171
is that I never ask my clients

474
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:54,699
to judge me on my winners.

475
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:58,627
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

476
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,261
And in the case of Aerotyne,

477
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:02,972
based on every technical
factor out there, John,

478
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:06,252
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

479
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:09,145
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do 4 grand.</i>

480
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:11,494
$4,000? That'd be
40,000 shares, John.

481
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:12,982
Let me lock in that trade right now

482
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,359
and get back to you
with my secretary

483
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,361
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

484
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:17,747
<i>- Yeah, sounds good.</i>
- Great.

485
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:18,947
Hey, John.

486
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,645
Thank you for your
vote of confidence.

487
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:22,574
And welcome to the
Investor's Center.

488
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:23,772
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i>

489
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:25,194
Bye-bye.

490
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:30,256
How'd you fucking do that?

491
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:34,961
<i>Just like that, I made 2 grand.</i>

492
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,911
<i>The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.</i>

493
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:40,665
Great! Even better!

494
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:42,760
<i>I was selling garbage
to garbage men</i>

495
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,413
<i>and making cash hand over fist.</i>

496
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:47,168
The only problem you're gonna
have is that you didn't buy more.

497
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,016
Boom shocka locka!

498
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:51,060
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i>

499
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,564
<i>But the way I looked at it, their
money was better off in my pocket.</i>

500
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,558
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i>

501
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:59,307
<i>Excuse me.
Is that your car in the lot?</i>

502
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:00,811
Yeah.

503
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:02,848
<i>- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.</i>

504
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:04,084
Donnie Azoff.

505
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:05,199
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

506
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,569
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

507
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,452
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

508
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:10,236
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

509
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:12,123
I think we live in
the same building.

510
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:13,291
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

511
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:15,118
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

512
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:16,294
Fourth floor.

513
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:18,287
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

514
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,286
What do you do, bro?

515
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:24,249
What do you mean, what do I do?

516
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,510
For work, what do you do?

517
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,787
I'm a stockbroker.

518
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:28,669
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

519
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,337
Children's furniture.

520
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:31,641
Oh, good for you.

521
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:33,135
It's all right.

522
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:34,713
You make a lot of money?

523
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,806
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

524
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:39,141
I'm trying to put it together.

525
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,609
You got your fucking nice car,

526
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,152
we live in the same
building. I just...

527
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:44,897
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

528
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,776
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

529
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:50,653
Get the fuck...

530
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,483
Get the fuck out of here.

531
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:53,820
No, I'm serious.

532
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,153
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

533
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,318
Seriously,
how much money do you make?

534
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,658
I told you. $70,000.

535
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:02,308
Well, technically, $72,000.

536
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:04,333
Last month. Something like that.

537
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,344
You made 72 grand in one month?

538
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,665
Yeah.

539
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:14,381
I'll tell you what.

540
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:17,517
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

541
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:19,921
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

542
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,395
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i>

543
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,771
No, yeah, yeah.
No, everything's fine.

544
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:32,309
Hey, listen, I quit.

545
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,231
<i>And he did quit his job.</i>

546
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,494
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.</i>

547
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,318
<i>I mean, I just met
this fucking guy.</i>

548
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:39,238
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

549
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:40,624
<i>There were other
things about him, too.</i>

550
00:23:40,724 --> 00:23:42,834
<i>Like his phosphorescent
white teeth.</i>

551
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:44,086
wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

552
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:46,338
<i>The fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lenses</i>

553
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:48,241
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i>

554
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:51,377
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i>

555
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:54,054
I heard some stupid shit.
I don't know.

556
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:56,503
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

557
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:58,509
- it's stupid.
- Shit with me?

558
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,727
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

559
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:03,301
I don't even listen
to it half the time.

560
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,966
What are they saying?

561
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,402
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

562
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:09,735
I don't even listen to it.

563
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:12,395
Oh, bro, it's not like that.

564
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:13,773
It's not like that.

565
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:16,776
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

566
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:18,703
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

567
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,621
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

568
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:23,275
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

569
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,410
Is she like a first
cousin, or is she...

570
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,585
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

571
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:28,659
Her... Her father

572
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:31,579
is the brother of my mom.

573
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,251
It's not like, what... You know.

574
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,627
Look, we grew up together.

575
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:37,263
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

576
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:39,098
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

577
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:40,842
And I'm not gonna let someone...

578
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:42,768
You know, one of these
assholes fuck my cousin,

579
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:44,854
so, you know, I used
the cousin thing

580
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:46,344
as like an in with her.

581
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,899
I'm not gonna let someone
else fuck my cousin.

582
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,651
You know,
if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

583
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,610
it's gonna be me, out of respect.
You know?

584
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,778
No, I get it. Yeah.

585
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:56,106
I mean, you're not afraid of
like the whole kid thing, right?

586
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:57,365
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

587
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:58,733
No. We have two kids.

588
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,201
And they're... I mean...

589
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,871
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

590
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,094
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

591
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:07,074
But there's a big
chance, right, if...

592
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,460
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

593
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,077
60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna
be fucking retarded or whatever.

594
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:14,290
That'd scare the shit
out of me, buddy.

595
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,675
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

596
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:18,469
whether you're fucking
cousins or not.

597
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:21,305
What if something
like that happened?

598
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:22,973
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

599
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:26,393
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

600
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:28,145
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

601
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:30,469
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

602
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:31,966
You know?

603
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:38,247
You're completely fucking with me.

604
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,775
That's horrible.
You're not gonna...

605
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,453
You look like you've... No.

606
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:46,371
We would take it to,
like, an institution or somewhere

607
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:47,623
that's handled to, like, you know,

608
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:49,321
raise the kid or whatever.

609
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:51,877
You know what? If you're
happy, God bless you, buddy.

610
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:53,045
No, I'm not fucking happy.

611
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:55,307
No one who's married
is fucking happy.

612
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:56,992
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, buddy.

613
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:59,218
Listen, I'm really, you know...

614
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:01,647
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

615
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:02,887
I'm really enjoying it.

616
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:04,388
I'm really happy with
what you're doing.

617
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:06,587
Actually, I got you
a little present.

618
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,267
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

619
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,653
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

620
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:10,936
Yeah. It's in the back though.

621
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,511
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

622
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,850
Like it's wrapped up or something?

623
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,401
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

624
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,611
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

625
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,230
Let's fucking go. Come on.

626
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,369
Your turn.

627
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:23,457
I'm not fucking doing this.

628
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:24,607
You're out of your fucking mind.

629
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,619
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

630
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,704
No one's fucking here, bro.

631
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:29,902
Get the fuck...

632
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,707
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

633
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:32,875
I'm not fucking doing it.

634
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:35,709
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

635
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:38,204
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

636
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,198
Fucking nut job.

637
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:03,979
Wow!

638
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,732
Wow.

639
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:12,780
Let's go run, huh?

640
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:14,986
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

641
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,750
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

642
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,371
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

643
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:23,911
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

644
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,001
Let's fucking run! Go!

645
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,477
Go, go, go, go!

646
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,889
<i>You've reached
Frank's Best Auto Body.</i>

647
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:32,432
<i>We're closed right now.</i>

648
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:34,547
<i>So please leave us a message.</i>

649
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:36,311
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

650
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:39,772
<i>My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.</i>

651
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:42,358
<i>Donnie and I were
going out on our own.</i>

652
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,777
<i>And the first thing
we needed was brokers.</i>

653
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,779
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i>

654
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:48,781
<i>So I recruited some
of my hometown boys.</i>

655
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:50,825
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat</i>

656
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:52,035
<i>and weed.</i>

657
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:54,328
<i>Chester, who sold tires</i>

658
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:55,495
<i>and weed.</i>

659
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:58,490
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.</i>

660
00:27:58,591 --> 00:27:59,863
<i>Mostly weed.</i>

661
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:02,491
Can you bring me some ketchup?
Okay?

662
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:03,921
<i>This is Brad.</i>

663
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:05,672
<i>And Brad's the guy
I really wanted.</i>

664
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:07,007
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i>

665
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:09,635
<i>He was already making so much
money selling Quaaludes,</i>

666
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:12,471
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.</i>

667
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:13,639
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

668
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:14,710
Yeah, man, of course.

669
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,642
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

670
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,017
Let 'em watch.

671
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:20,011
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

672
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:24,099
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

673
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:27,345
Why don't you bring me a pair of her
panties next time you come through.

674
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:30,264
Yeah, man. She said she don't
want to talk to you anymore, man.

675
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:31,695
Get the fuck out of here.

676
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:34,817
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

677
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:36,903
Ma!

678
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,526
You listening?
It's easier than you think.

679
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:40,998
Every person you're
on the phone with,

680
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,626
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

681
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:44,835
They all want something
for nothing.

682
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:47,421
There was this one time that I was
selling pot to this Amish dude.

683
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:48,881
You know those guys
who got like the beard

684
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:51,079
with like no mustache
or some bullshit?

685
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,004
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

686
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:56,558
I don't understand.

687
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:57,858
What's that
got to do with anything?

688
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,838
What the fuck are
you talking about?

689
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:01,726
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

690
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:04,989
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

691
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:07,550
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

692
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:09,859
What the fuck are
you talking about?

693
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,027
Yeah, like Buddhists.

694
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:12,098
They don't give a shit about money.

695
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:14,155
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

696
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:15,991
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

697
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,450
I'm talking about normal people,

698
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,827
working-class, everyday people.

699
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:20,829
Everyone wants to
get rich. Am I crazy?

700
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,205
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

701
00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:24,199
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

702
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:26,501
Can we get some ketchup, please?

703
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:27,961
Do you guys not want to make money?

704
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:29,754
I want to make some money.

705
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:31,172
I want to make some
fucking money, okay.

706
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:32,520
I can sell anything.

707
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,551
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

708
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,573
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

709
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,503
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

710
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:40,181
Sell me this fucking
pen right here.

711
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,933
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

712
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,256
Sell me the pen.

713
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:46,028
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

714
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:48,470
Brad, show them how
it's done. Boom.

715
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,034
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

716
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:51,650
You want me to sell
this fucking pen?

717
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,054
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

718
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:55,237
Why don't you do me a favor.

719
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,954
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

720
00:29:57,054 --> 00:29:58,115
I don't have a pen.

721
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,213
Exactly. Supply and
demand, my friend.

722
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:01,325
Holy shit.

723
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,617
See what I'm saying?
He's creating urgency.

724
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,036
Get them to want to buy the stock.

725
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,912
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

726
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,315
And that's the thing.

727
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:09,050
All nuns are lesbians.

728
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,876
What the fuck are you
talking about, Otter?

729
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,502
Think about it.
They can't keep a dude

730
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,754
so they're gonna start
fucking chicks.

731
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,038
Four fucking times,
Kimmie! Four times.

732
00:30:16,138 --> 00:30:17,507
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

733
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,959
Now she runs.

734
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:21,920
<i>But look. I knew these
guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i>

735
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,597
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,</i>

736
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,891
<i>took five years to
finish high school.</i>

737
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,726
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,</i>

738
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,969
<i>didn't even graduate.</i>

739
00:30:29,112 --> 00:30:31,104
<i>Chester Ming, the
depraved Chinaman,</i>

740
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,303
<i>thought jujitsu was in Israel.</i>

741
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:35,776
<i>Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.</i>

742
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,527
<i>He actually went to law school.</i>

743
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,103
<i>I called him Rugrat because of
his piece of shit hairpiece.</i>

744
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,950
<i>Still, give them to me young,
hungry and stupid</i>

745
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,150
<i>and in no time,
I'll make them rich.</i>

746
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:51,570
Oh, my God.

747
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:52,950
Jordan, that...

748
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:54,293
You like it, baby?

749
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:56,196
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

750
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,631
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

751
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,659
but I promise they're
really high quality.

752
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:01,914
It's beautiful.

753
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,996
They're so beautiful.

754
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,710
Oh, boy.

755
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:07,139
What?

756
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,725
I know that look.
What is it? Go ahead.

757
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,503
I don't know, it's... You know...

758
00:31:12,028 --> 00:31:14,426
These stocks... These companies...

759
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,482
They're like crappy companies.

760
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:17,890
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

761
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,394
Yeah, they're terrible.

762
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:21,487
Don't worry about it. I told you,

763
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:22,897
what I'm doing is completely legal.

764
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:23,993
Yeah, I know.

765
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:26,313
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

766
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:29,120
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

767
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,648
You know how it goes.

768
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:33,249
Wouldn't you feel better if you
sold that stuff to rich people

769
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,653
who can, like,
afford to lose all that money?

770
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:38,658
Of course.

771
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:41,786
But rich people don't
buy penny stocks.

772
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:43,743
They just don't.

773
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:45,369
Why not?

774
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,179
<i>Because they're too smart,</i>

775
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,544
<i>that's why not.</i>

776
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:53,559
<i>I mean, what person with
a college education</i>

777
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:54,935
<i>would trust this
bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

778
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:56,186
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

779
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:57,354
I got 5 fucking grand
on the phone right now!

780
00:31:57,454 --> 00:31:58,605
Hey!

781
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:01,650
<i>But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

782
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,000
<i>What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?</i>

783
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,601
<i>Real money.</i>

784
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:09,108
<i>So I decided to
reinvent the company.</i>

785
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:11,528
Gentlemen, welcome

786
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:14,440
to Stratton Oakmont.

787
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,323
You schnooks will now be targeting

788
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:19,577
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

789
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:21,704
We're talking about whales here.

790
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:23,660
Moby fucking Dicks.

791
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,885
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

792
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:30,095
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

793
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,874
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

794
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:34,589
Get it? Huh?

795
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:35,876
Captain who?

796
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:37,545
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

797
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,181
The book, motherfucker.
From the book.

798
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:43,232
Turn your fucking brain on.

799
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:44,650
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

800
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,729
Listen to me. We're a
new company with a new name.

801
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:50,858
A company that our
clients can believe in.

802
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,936
A company that our
clients can trust.

803
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:58,664
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

804
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:02,168
that our very founders sailed over
on the Mayflower

805
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:04,077
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

806
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:06,535
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

807
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,225
You got it?

808
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:10,092
What we're gonna do is this.

809
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:13,387
First we pitch 'em
Disney, AT&T, IBM,

810
00:33:13,487 --> 00:33:15,348
blue chip stocks exclusively.

811
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:17,672
Companies these people know.

812
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:21,743
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

813
00:33:21,843 --> 00:33:23,898
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,

814
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:25,596
where we make the money.

815
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:27,801
- 50% commission, baby.
- Ooh.

816
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:30,860
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

817
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,015
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

818
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:36,950
Because by the time you read about
it in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

819
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,944
it's already too late.

820
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,120
Then you wait.

821
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,288
You wait.

822
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,033
And whoever speaks first loses.

823
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:48,265
<i>Sorry, uh...</i>

824
00:33:48,365 --> 00:33:49,827
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

825
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,257
<i>I really have to give
this some thought</i>

826
00:33:52,357 --> 00:33:54,092
<i>and talk to my wife about it.</i>

827
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:55,335
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

828
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,886
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

829
00:33:56,986 --> 00:33:59,305
they gotta talk to their fucking
wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

830
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,224
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

831
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:04,811
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

832
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:06,521
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

833
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:08,492
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

834
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:11,109
So, what do you say?

835
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:14,362
You mean to tell me that if I put
you in at Union Carbide at 7

836
00:34:14,462 --> 00:34:15,916
and took you out at 32...

837
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:18,533
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

838
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:21,202
U.S. Steel at 16,
took you out at 41...

839
00:34:21,302 --> 00:34:22,829
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

840
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,706
"pick me up a few thousand
shares of Disney

841
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:26,483
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

842
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:28,333
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly?
Seriously?

843
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,751
<i>I don't know you.</i>

844
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:32,155
<i>You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.</i>

845
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:33,297
I am in complete
agreement with you.

846
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:35,102
You don't know me,
I don't know you.

847
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:36,300
Let me introduce myself to you.

848
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,759
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

849
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,211
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

850
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,096
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

851
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,598
and I plan on being one of the...

852
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,975
top brokers in my firm next year.

853
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:47,038
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

854
00:34:47,138 --> 00:34:49,062
<i>I do wanna say that
you sound like a...</i>

855
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:50,897
<i>You sound like a
pretty sincere guy.</i>

856
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:52,065
<i>It's not gonna make you rich</i>

857
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:53,191
<i>and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>

858
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,769
But what this trade
will do is serve as...

859
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:58,143
a benchmark
for future business, Kevin.

860
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:00,032
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

861
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,366
And then you'll know for sure

862
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,535
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

863
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,162
that you can trust,

864
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:08,887
and who can consistently
make you money.

865
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:10,409
Sound fair enough?

866
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:14,403
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>

867
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,031
<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i>

868
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:20,133
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

869
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:21,285
Kevin.

870
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:23,761
You give me one shot here

871
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:26,472
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

872
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:28,724
and believe me, Kevin,

873
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:31,352
the only problem you're gonna have

874
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:33,907
is that you didn't buy more.

875
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,556
Sound fair enough?

876
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,142
<i>Shit. My...</i>

877
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:41,558
<i>Uh...</i>

878
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:43,644
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>

879
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,899
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

880
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:47,951
Excellent choice, Kevin.

881
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:49,900
How much do you
want to go for this time?

882
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,914
<i>Let's do 5... $5,000.</i>

883
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:53,165
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

884
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:54,659
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>

885
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:55,918
<i>- Ten.
- You want to do that?</i>

886
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:57,010
Excellent choice!

887
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,504
Kevin, let me lock in
that trade right now

888
00:35:58,604 --> 00:35:59,797
and get back to you
in a few minutes

889
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:01,256
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

890
00:36:01,356 --> 00:36:03,926
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

891
00:36:04,026 --> 00:36:06,231
<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i>

892
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,429
<i>This is fun.</i>

893
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:08,733
Take it easy, Kev.

894
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,758
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...</i>

895
00:36:11,443 --> 00:36:13,466
Fuck that motherfucker!

896
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,422
That's what I'm talking about!

897
00:36:18,782 --> 00:36:20,179
What a fucking idiot.

898
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,725
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

899
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:27,145
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

900
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:28,399
Get in now or...

901
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,118
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

902
00:36:30,218 --> 00:36:31,411
and I'm a Senior Vice President

903
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:32,779
with Stratton Oakmont.

904
00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:37,034
Judy, I am so, so, so
sorry for your loss.

905
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:38,501
When did he pass?

906
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:39,593
Just say I'm wrong, right.

907
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:40,712
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

908
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,296
and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

909
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:45,174
God rest his soul,
"A shit ton of money."

910
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:46,384
It's like getting in
on fucking sunlight

911
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:48,082
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

912
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:49,929
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i>

913
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:51,548
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i>

914
00:36:53,317 --> 00:36:54,598
That's a very intelligent decision.

915
00:36:54,698 --> 00:36:56,409
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

916
00:36:57,194 --> 00:36:58,295
Rhonda!

917
00:36:58,945 --> 00:37:00,271
- Rhonda!
- ...put you through to Andrea.

918
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:02,140
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

919
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:09,822
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i>

920
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:11,065
Yeah!

921
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,492
<i>The end of the month.</i>

922
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:17,162
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i>

923
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:20,032
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i>

924
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:24,711
<i>And to celebrate with our
weekly act of debauchery,</i>

925
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:26,546
<i>I have offered our
lovely sales assistant,</i>

926
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,548
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i>

927
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:32,343
<i>$10,000 to shave her fucking head!</i>

928
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:33,620
Yeah!

929
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:37,153
Yeah, you want this?

930
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:38,317
You want this?

931
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,844
<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i>

932
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:43,238
Let the scalping begin!

933
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:48,352
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

934
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:52,447
<i>FYI, boys, Danielle has promised</i>

935
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:55,492
<i>to use this $10,000
for breast implants!</i>

936
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:56,910
<i>She's already got C cups,</i>

937
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,046
<i>but now she wants
fucking double D's!</i>

938
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:01,778
<i>Is this a great fucking
company or what?</i>

939
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,113
<i>Is this the greatest company
in the world?</i>

940
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,517
<i>Donnie!</i>

941
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:15,044
<i>Blow the roof off
this motherfucker!</i>

942
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,319
- Champagne?
- Whoo!

943
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:51,700
<i>Send in the stripees!</i>

944
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:27,106
Mine!

945
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:45,765
<i>Word about us
spread throughout Wall Street.</i>

946
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:47,793
<i>Even the places I
didn't want it to.</i>

947
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,821
<i>It wasn't long before
Forbes magazine,</i>

948
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:02,656
<i>the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.</i>

949
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:06,076
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

950
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:07,399
One word?

951
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:11,195
Diversification.

952
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:13,208
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

953
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:14,300
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

954
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,445
Can we get a quick picture?

955
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:19,975
<i>A total fucking hatchet job.</i>

956
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:22,204
<i>This conniving little twat!
Look at this!</i>

957
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,165
"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.

958
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:26,335
Your hair looks good.

959
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:27,888
- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

960
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:29,348
"Jordan Belfort,

961
00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:31,934
"sounding like a kind
of twisted Robin Hood

962
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:34,675
"who takes from the rich

963
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:36,521
"and his merry little
band of brokers."

964
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:38,049
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

965
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:41,902
There is no such thing as
bad publicity, sweetheart.

966
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:43,396
Read the article, babe.

967
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:46,061
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

968
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:47,476
Big fucking deal I look great.

969
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:50,327
Mr. Belfort!
Can you look at my resume, please?

970
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:52,401
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

971
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:56,276
Calm the fuck down!

972
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:58,156
What the hell's all this?

973
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:01,037
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

974
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:02,213
Hey! What did I say?

975
00:41:02,313 --> 00:41:03,581
I'm just trying to be nice.

976
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,501
Hey, you want a job,
you talk to me!

977
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:07,852
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

978
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:10,585
Forbes made me a superstar.

979
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,637
<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.</i>

980
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:20,564
<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight</i>

981
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:22,274
<i>and spent whatever
allowance they had</i>

982
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,777
<i>on a new suit from
our Stratton tailor.</i>

983
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:26,475
Are you fucking serious right now?

984
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:30,607
<i>I mean, we were literally putting
clothes on these kids' backs.</i>

985
00:41:30,707 --> 00:41:33,270
<i>And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.</i>

986
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,914
<i>But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,</i>

987
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:40,444
<i>there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.</i>

988
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,910
<i>Within months, we doubled in size,</i>

989
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,790
<i>moved to even bigger offices.</i>

990
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:54,458
<i>It was a madhouse.</i>

991
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:56,047
<i>A greed-fest,</i>

992
00:41:56,147 --> 00:42:00,088
<i>with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.</i>

993
00:42:00,446 --> 00:42:01,672
Yes!

994
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:06,233
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone</i>

995
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,223
<i>between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.</i>

996
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:10,946
<i>But I'm telling you,
even that didn't help.</i>

997
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:14,116
<i>Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,</i>

998
00:42:14,216 --> 00:42:15,659
<i>when one of our
brokers, Ben Jenner,</i>

999
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:17,870
<i>christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob</i>

1000
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,455
<i>from a sales assistant.</i>

1001
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:21,457
<i>Her name was Pam,
and to her credit,</i>

1002
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:23,792
<i>she did have this
amazing technique,</i>

1003
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:26,617
<i>with this wild twist
and jerk motion.</i>

1004
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:28,088
<i>About a month later,</i>

1005
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:30,090
<i>Donnie and I decided
to double-team her</i>

1006
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,341
<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i>

1007
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:34,245
<i>while our wives were out shopping
for Christmas dresses.</i>

1008
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:35,846
<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i>

1009
00:42:35,946 --> 00:42:38,390
<i>which was pretty amazing
considering she blew</i>

1010
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,839
<i>every single guy in the office.</i>

1011
00:42:40,985 --> 00:42:44,180
<i>Then he got depressed and killed
himself three years later.</i>

1012
00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:48,650
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i>

1013
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,802
<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>

1014
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:55,281
<i>We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>

1015
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:56,741
<i>which could be set off by something</i>

1016
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,793
<i>as innocuous as a
ringing telephone.</i>

1017
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,081
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

1018
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,860
to call this house
on a Tuesday night?

1019
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:08,044
God damn it!

1020
00:43:08,144 --> 00:43:09,170
You're gonna miss it!

1021
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,089
Ooh, please, tell me
something I don't know.

1022
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,925
I wait all week for
the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>

1023
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,302
and they have to fucking... Hello.

1024
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:18,096
<i>But as soon as
he picked up the phone...</i>

1025
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,504
Gene. How are you, Gene?

1026
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:21,516
<i>he'd affect this weird
British accent.</i>

1027
00:43:21,616 --> 00:43:23,419
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

1028
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:25,103
Cheerio.

1029
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,195
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>

1030
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:27,855
The fucking halfwit!

1031
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:28,981
<i>- He'd hang up...</i>
- You missed it!

1032
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:31,055
<i>and then he's Mad
Max all over again.</i>

1033
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,473
Damn it!

1034
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:34,434
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

1035
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:36,948
Well, he discovered it
was the mother's sister.

1036
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,449
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

1037
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,118
The main guy.
You know who the main...

1038
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,285
The main guy...

1039
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,780
it was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

1040
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,704
<i>Of course, Mad
Max didn't have to know</i>

1041
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:48,573
<i>everything we were
doing at Stratton.</i>

1042
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:50,697
And then there's a
big target and we...

1043
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:52,680
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

1044
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,879
<i>There's a bull's-eye
and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>

1045
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:56,047
<i>Whoever gets closer
to the dollar sign...</i>

1046
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:57,118
gets the most points.

1047
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,384
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

1048
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:01,386
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

1049
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:02,720
'Cause we're gonna
get fucking nuts.

1050
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,055
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

1051
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:05,932
They got like superhuman strength.

1052
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:07,225
I think he's gonna be fine.

1053
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:09,227
You can't look him
right in the eyes.

1054
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:10,478
You can't look him in the eye?

1055
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:12,283
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

1056
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,190
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

1057
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,817
You gotta look at their chin.

1058
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:16,943
Like it looks like
I'm looking at you

1059
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:18,035
but I'm looking at your chin.

1060
00:44:18,135 --> 00:44:20,238
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

1061
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:22,240
They're like <i>the Mona Lisa.</i>
They find eye contact,

1062
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,919
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

1063
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:25,227
And they lock in.

1064
00:44:25,336 --> 00:44:27,736
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

1065
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:29,080
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

1066
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,582
We're allowed to
throw food? Bananas.

1067
00:44:30,682 --> 00:44:32,083
Any food. Correct.

1068
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:33,251
But, for example,
what I wouldn't do is

1069
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,086
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out

1070
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:36,891
and like get some of the girls to,
you know,

1071
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,047
fondle him and shit like that.

1072
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:39,139
That would be...
That's unacceptable?

1073
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:40,224
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1074
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:42,302
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1075
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:43,415
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1076
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,845
The thing is, this
is their gift, okay.

1077
00:44:44,945 --> 00:44:46,972
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1078
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:48,265
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1079
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:49,357
So they're built for accuracy.

1080
00:44:49,457 --> 00:44:51,404
Oh, my God. Can we
bowl with this guy?

1081
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:52,561
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1082
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:53,979
His brother's the bowling ball.

1083
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,772
The brother,
you put a skateboard on him,

1084
00:44:55,872 --> 00:44:57,107
you strap him to a skateboard,

1085
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:58,609
you toss him down an
alley at some pins.

1086
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:00,319
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1087
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:02,404
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1088
00:45:02,504 --> 00:45:04,573
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1089
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:05,908
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1090
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:07,284
They are very ornery by the way,

1091
00:45:07,384 --> 00:45:08,785
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1092
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:09,877
Safety first.

1093
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,038
Safety is first, all right?

1094
00:45:11,138 --> 00:45:12,956
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1095
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:14,708
ready to knock this fucker out.

1096
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:16,960
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1097
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,052
A pellet gun maybe?

1098
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:19,254
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1099
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:20,746
I just want him out.
Knocked out cold.

1100
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:23,410
But I say we stick with
the loophole. Right? Okay?

1101
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,302
If we don't consider him a human,

1102
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:27,554
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1103
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:28,680
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1104
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,723
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1105
00:45:30,823 --> 00:45:32,558
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1106
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:34,510
is that these things gossip.

1107
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,145
They get together and they gossip.

1108
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:37,647
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1109
00:45:37,747 --> 00:45:39,898
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1110
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:41,566
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1111
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:43,235
Like, it's gonna make
Stratton look bad.

1112
00:45:43,335 --> 00:45:45,403
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1113
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:48,558
When they come in, we treat
it just like one of us. Okay?

1114
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:51,899
One of us.
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1115
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,589
We accept them, one of us!

1116
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:55,360
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1117
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,748
We accept them, one of us.

1118
00:45:56,848 --> 00:45:57,874
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1119
00:45:57,974 --> 00:45:59,251
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1120
00:45:59,351 --> 00:46:00,849
Something about the
American Express bill.

1121
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:02,079
Can you get him out of here?

1122
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,309
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1123
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:04,661
No, I'm serious!

1124
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:07,050
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1125
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,669
You got any fucking stock forms?

1126
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,220
He's coming, he's coming.

1127
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,497
Make some shit up.

1128
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:13,628
I think if we short Pfizer...

1129
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:18,634
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1130
00:46:18,738 --> 00:46:23,984
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1131
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,194
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1132
00:46:26,294 --> 00:46:27,529
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1133
00:46:27,629 --> 00:46:29,030
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1134
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:33,006
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1135
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:34,858
Okay. No, no.
This could be explained.

1136
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:37,364
Dad, we had clients.
The Pfizer clients.

1137
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:39,248
Right. The porterhouse
from Argentina.

1138
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:41,542
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1139
00:46:41,642 --> 00:46:43,157
And you ordered all
the fucking sides.

1140
00:46:43,257 --> 00:46:45,212
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1141
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:48,833
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1142
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:51,210
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1143
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:53,137
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1144
00:46:53,237 --> 00:46:54,710
That's why they were expensive.

1145
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,695
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1146
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:58,726
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1147
00:46:58,826 --> 00:47:00,550
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1148
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,397
Well, that's, uh...

1149
00:47:03,497 --> 00:47:04,606
Yeah, Jordy,
what's EJ Entertainment?

1150
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:05,733
How do I describe this?

1151
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:06,859
Jord, what is that?

1152
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:09,062
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1153
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:11,205
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1154
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:13,280
Isn't that the perfect
description for it?

1155
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,949
That is what it is. But none
of these were charged to me.

1156
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:17,378
This is all of them.

1157
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:19,244
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1158
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:21,217
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1159
00:47:21,317 --> 00:47:23,775
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1160
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,418
The IRS, they allow
for T&A. It's fine.

1161
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:27,711
T&E!

1162
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:28,869
T&E!

1163
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:30,005
Yeah. I said T&E.

1164
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:31,380
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1165
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,472
Yeah, you did.

1166
00:47:32,572 --> 00:47:34,842
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1167
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:36,218
I know you're upset
about the dinner,

1168
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,598
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1169
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:42,308
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1170
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:43,684
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1171
00:47:43,784 --> 00:47:45,102
Absolutely, no question.

1172
00:47:45,202 --> 00:47:46,354
I'm trying to...

1173
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:47,480
I'm getting this close!

1174
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,773
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1175
00:47:48,873 --> 00:47:51,317
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1176
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:52,443
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1177
00:47:52,543 --> 00:47:54,101
Why do you hold it in?
Why do you...

1178
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:55,863
Max, why do you hold it in?

1179
00:47:55,963 --> 00:47:57,690
That's it. Get the
fuck out of here!

1180
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,147
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1181
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,235
What kind of hooker
takes credit cards?

1182
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:03,371
A rich one.

1183
00:48:03,471 --> 00:48:05,790
<i>At Stratton,
there were three kinds of hookers.</i>

1184
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,167
<i>The Blue Chips, top of the line,
model material.</i>

1185
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:09,752
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>

1186
00:48:09,852 --> 00:48:11,128
<i>and you had to wear a condom</i>

1187
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:12,630
<i>unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>

1188
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,603
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>

1189
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:18,302
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.</i>

1190
00:48:18,402 --> 00:48:20,721
<i>They cost between
200 and 300 bucks.</i>

1191
00:48:20,821 --> 00:48:23,299
<i>Finally, there were the
Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i>

1192
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:26,268
<i>They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,</i>

1193
00:48:26,368 --> 00:48:27,602
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i>

1194
00:48:27,702 --> 00:48:30,063
<i>the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.</i>

1195
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:32,057
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i>

1196
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:33,968
<i>Believe me, we did.</i>

1197
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:36,808
Ow! It's that slipped
disc thing again.

1198
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:39,356
I know what it is.
You know, too much...

1199
00:48:39,665 --> 00:48:41,116
with EJ Entertainment.

1200
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:42,208
Pops.

1201
00:48:42,308 --> 00:48:43,673
How are things at home?

1202
00:48:43,773 --> 00:48:45,354
Well, not the best.

1203
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:47,982
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1204
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,499
It's like the smell...

1205
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,201
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1206
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:53,837
After a while it kind of fades away
a little bit.

1207
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:55,588
Yeah, well. It's
supposed to fade away.

1208
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:57,621
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1209
00:48:57,721 --> 00:49:00,334
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1210
00:49:00,434 --> 00:49:01,552
What do you think? We're, we're...

1211
00:49:01,652 --> 00:49:03,504
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1212
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:05,006
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1213
00:49:05,148 --> 00:49:07,250
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1214
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:08,600
It's crazy out there.

1215
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,185
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1216
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:11,588
Oh, my God!

1217
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:13,188
They're fucking...

1218
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:15,190
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1219
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,643
I mean... I mean, it's
on a whole other level.

1220
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:19,309
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1221
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:20,873
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1222
00:49:20,973 --> 00:49:22,312
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1223
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:24,670
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1224
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,733
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1225
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:30,413
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1226
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:31,505
It's a new world.

1227
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:33,541
They're bald from
the eyebrows down.

1228
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,195
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1229
00:49:36,303 --> 00:49:37,620
Wow. A new world.

1230
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:40,741
I was born too... Too early.

1231
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:43,043
I've never been a fan of the bush,
to be honest.

1232
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:44,385
- Really?
- Yeah.

1233
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:45,628
I don't mind it.

1234
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:46,997
Dad.

1235
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:49,541
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1236
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,850
How can I not get stressed out?

1237
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,310
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1238
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,561
I know they're knuckleheads

1239
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:55,965
but I need them to want to
live like me, you get it?

1240
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:57,382
To live like me.

1241
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:58,806
Jordy.

1242
00:49:58,906 --> 00:50:02,688
One of these days, the chickens are
gonna come home to roost.

1243
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,517
You're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

1244
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:09,987
Crazy? This is obscene.

1245
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:11,564
<i>It was obscene.</i>

1246
00:50:11,797 --> 00:50:13,319
<i>In the normal world.</i>

1247
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:15,822
<i>But who the fuck
wanted to live there?</i>

1248
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:19,658
<i>Go party your fucking cocks off!</i>

1249
00:50:22,306 --> 00:50:26,563
<i>We are about to
become fucking legends</i>

1250
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:28,587
<i>on Wall Street!</i>

1251
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,099
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

1252
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,220
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

1253
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:40,923
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1254
00:50:44,952 --> 00:50:46,749
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1255
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:49,280
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1256
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,573
This way we become
the underwriters.

1257
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,200
<i>It was our next big move.</i>

1258
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,870
<i>Finding companies to
take public. IPOs.</i>

1259
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,747
<i>It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks</i>

1260
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:01,543
<i>would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.</i>

1261
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:02,890
We got Arncliffe International.

1262
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,462
<i>See, we were a little different.</i>

1263
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,132
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows</i>

1264
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,677
<i>in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,</i>

1265
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,832
<i>which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.</i>

1266
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,961
Steve Madden.

1267
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,600
We own the fucking companies...

1268
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,477
We own the companies...

1269
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,532
<i>Don't know what
a lude is? I'll tell you.</i>

1270
00:51:22,632 --> 00:51:24,618
<i>Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

1271
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:29,475
<i>Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.</i>

1272
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:04,229
The Quaalude,

1273
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,190
<i>or lude, as it is
commonly referred to,</i>

1274
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,818
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i>

1275
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,570
<i>by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,</i>

1276
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,071
<i>as a sedative,</i>

1277
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:18,068
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.</i>

1278
00:52:18,585 --> 00:52:20,870
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i>

1279
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:24,705
<i>that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for just 15 minutes,</i>

1280
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:27,234
<i>you got a pretty
kick-ass high from it.</i>

1281
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:31,162
<i>Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes, of course.</i>

1282
00:52:31,262 --> 00:52:34,495
<i>And in 1982, the U-S.
government Schedule 1'd them.</i>

1283
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:36,701
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i>

1284
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:40,130
<i>Which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left.</i>

1285
00:52:40,313 --> 00:52:43,166
<i>No shit,
you can't even buy 'em anymore.</i>

1286
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:45,695
<i>You people are all
shit out of luck.</i>

1287
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,269
What are you saying? What is it?

1288
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:48,552
Steve Madden.

1289
00:52:48,652 --> 00:52:50,590
Steve Madden.

1290
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,928
Steve.

1291
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:53,217
Steve.

1292
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,902
<i>You remember those ads?</i>

1293
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:57,363
<i>Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes</i>

1294
00:52:57,463 --> 00:52:59,141
<i>wearing those big clunky shoes?</i>

1295
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:01,367
My friend from school,
Steve Madden.

1296
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:02,826
His friend from
school, Steve Madden.

1297
00:53:02,926 --> 00:53:05,704
<i>Steve Madden was the name in
women's shoes at the moment.</i>

1298
00:53:05,804 --> 00:53:09,499
<i>And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.</i>

1299
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,833
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1300
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:12,210
<i>Except, guess who grew up with him?</i>

1301
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,087
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1302
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:16,787
<i>My very own Vice President.</i>

1303
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:18,633
Women's shoes!

1304
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:20,582
<i>Diamond Donnie Azoff.</i>

1305
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,221
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1306
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:24,639
Steve.

1307
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:25,765
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1308
00:53:25,865 --> 00:53:27,048
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1309
00:53:27,148 --> 00:53:28,961
Look at this. Look.

1310
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:36,859
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1311
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:39,433
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1312
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:41,770
You want to see
the Wolf handle this?

1313
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:45,728
She's hot.

1314
00:53:46,044 --> 00:53:47,566
Cristy.

1315
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:54,494
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1316
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:57,130
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1317
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,766
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1318
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:00,667
You got an awesome place here.

1319
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:02,969
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1320
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:04,291
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1321
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:05,583
Beautiful beach out there.

1322
00:54:05,683 --> 00:54:06,870
Blair Hollingsworth.

1323
00:54:07,813 --> 00:54:09,130
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1324
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,862
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1325
00:54:10,962 --> 00:54:12,258
You like to Jet Ski?

1326
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:13,852
I've never done it before.

1327
00:54:13,952 --> 00:54:14,944
You've never
Jet Ski'd in your life?

1328
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,007
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1329
00:54:16,107 --> 00:54:17,522
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1330
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:18,773
How many times are
you gonna ask her?

1331
00:54:18,873 --> 00:54:20,301
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1332
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,974
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1333
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:25,648
Okay. Sure.

1334
00:54:26,207 --> 00:54:28,533
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1335
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:30,652
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1336
00:54:30,795 --> 00:54:32,109
Yeah, I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.

1337
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:33,496
Just tell her I'll be out
in a couple of minutes.

1338
00:54:33,596 --> 00:54:35,039
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1339
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,131
I might do that, but I'm having

1340
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,625
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1341
00:54:37,725 --> 00:54:39,669
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1342
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:40,998
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1343
00:54:41,098 --> 00:54:42,558
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1344
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:44,333
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1345
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:46,666
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1346
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:47,844
But we can stay for a drink...

1347
00:54:47,944 --> 00:54:49,212
She's

1348
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:51,002
perfect.

1349
00:54:51,102 --> 00:54:52,599
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1350
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:53,691
She's perfect.

1351
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,185
Donnie, what the
fuck are you doing?

1352
00:54:55,285 --> 00:54:57,009
You piece of...

1353
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:07,347
You're gonna have to excuse my friend.
He gets...

1354
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,697
Get the fuck out!

1355
00:55:08,797 --> 00:55:10,549
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1356
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:12,018
Yeah, Donnie!

1357
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:15,120
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1358
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,898
That's fucking rude.

1359
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:18,820
Have some fucking manners.

1360
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:24,745
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1361
00:55:24,845 --> 00:55:27,204
Brooklyn, across the
Verrazano Bridge.

1362
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,832
<i>Saturday Night Fever</i> territory.

1363
00:55:28,932 --> 00:55:30,495
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1364
00:55:30,603 --> 00:55:32,805
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1365
00:55:32,905 --> 00:55:33,972
Right.

1366
00:55:34,072 --> 00:55:35,750
So I presume you're Italian?

1367
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:36,975
On my dad's side.

1368
00:55:37,075 --> 00:55:40,346
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1369
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:41,927
I'm a mutt.

1370
00:55:42,115 --> 00:55:43,390
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1371
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,847
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1372
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:48,570
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1373
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,614
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1374
00:55:51,714 --> 00:55:53,032
That explains it then.

1375
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:54,124
Explains what?

1376
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:57,025
It explains you.
I mean, you're a duchess, right?

1377
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,234
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1378
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:03,625
Excuse me.

1379
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:05,744
Could I get a straw, please?

1380
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:08,414
Thank you.

1381
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:14,211
So I was, um, a little surprised

1382
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:16,668
you asked Cristy for my number.

1383
00:56:17,648 --> 00:56:19,000
Why is that?

1384
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:22,719
Aren't you married?

1385
00:56:23,821 --> 00:56:26,189
Well... Yeah, but what?

1386
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,263
Married people can't have friends?

1387
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:32,104
We're gonna be friends?

1388
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:36,268
Yeah. You don't want
to be my friend?

1389
00:56:40,338 --> 00:56:42,361
We're not gonna be friends.

1390
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:53,291
And at night I work on my designs.

1391
00:56:53,558 --> 00:56:56,010
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1392
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:59,040
You know, camisoles,
bustiers, panties.

1393
00:57:00,023 --> 00:57:02,391
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>

1394
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:04,260
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1395
00:57:14,371 --> 00:57:17,224
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.</i>

1396
00:57:22,212 --> 00:57:24,815
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1397
00:57:26,049 --> 00:57:27,776
Tea? Yeah.

1398
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:29,710
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1399
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,139
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1400
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,538
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah,
I wanted to come up for tea.</i>

1401
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:36,632
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1402
00:57:36,732 --> 00:57:37,703
Sure.

1403
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:38,997
This is Rocky.

1404
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:41,504
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1405
00:57:41,646 --> 00:57:42,942
Hi, sweetheart.

1406
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,169
Okay.

1407
00:57:44,732 --> 00:57:47,335
Why don't you light a fire or
something and I'll be right out.

1408
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,757
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1409
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:54,720
I like your painting here.
It's, uh...

1410
00:58:01,373 --> 00:58:04,477
<i>God, help me.
How do I fuck this girl?</i>

1411
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:09,038
You all right?

1412
00:58:09,138 --> 00:58:11,533
Yeah, yeah.
Just trying to light the fire here.

1413
00:58:17,305 --> 00:58:18,673
<i>That's it. That's it,
you're leaving.</i>

1414
00:58:18,773 --> 00:58:20,701
<i>Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.</i>

1415
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:32,395
<i>As you can probably guess,</i>

1416
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:35,140
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>

1417
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:36,949
Jesus Lord!

1418
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:41,430
<i>For 11 seconds.</i>

1419
00:58:52,173 --> 00:58:53,780
Did you just come?

1420
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,864
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1421
00:58:56,802 --> 00:58:58,224
Did you? Did you come?

1422
00:58:58,324 --> 00:58:59,921
- No.
- No?

1423
00:59:00,021 --> 00:59:01,160
Okay.

1424
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,417
I'm still hard so
just give me a sec.

1425
00:59:04,393 --> 00:59:05,915
Sure.

1426
00:59:06,145 --> 00:59:07,872
Come on, baby, come on.

1427
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:12,593
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1428
00:59:18,364 --> 00:59:19,841
Oh, God!

1429
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,843
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1430
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:23,110
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1431
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,262
It's okay.

1432
00:59:24,496 --> 00:59:25,988
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1433
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:28,016
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1434
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:31,785
You're crazy.

1435
00:59:31,885 --> 00:59:33,120
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

1436
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,581
<i>I mean, her pussy was
like heroin to me.</i>

1437
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:38,417
<i>And it wasn't just
about the sex, either.</i>

1438
00:59:38,517 --> 00:59:40,460
<i>Naomi and I got along.
I mean, we...</i>

1439
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,488
<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i>

1440
00:59:47,726 --> 00:59:49,453
Ooh. Choo-choo train.

1441
00:59:49,645 --> 00:59:50,837
Yeah.

1442
00:59:57,903 --> 01:00:01,724
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1443
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:11,021
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1444
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,700
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1445
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,228
Oh, shit!

1446
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:25,922
You!

1447
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,049
Get out of the fucking car!

1448
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:29,467
Jesus Christ.

1449
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,167
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1450
01:00:33,355 --> 01:00:35,298
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1451
01:00:35,774 --> 01:00:38,016
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1452
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:39,510
Okay, babe, stop!

1453
01:00:39,777 --> 01:00:41,800
- Please.
- Bitch!

1454
01:00:42,363 --> 01:00:44,147
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1455
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:45,732
Jesus Christ!

1456
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:46,858
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1457
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:48,235
I thought you were at
the fucking beach!

1458
01:00:48,335 --> 01:00:49,729
I didn't know you were here!

1459
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:51,279
That's where you've fucking been?

1460
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:53,031
With that fucking
whore from the party?

1461
01:00:53,131 --> 01:00:54,574
I thought you were
at the beach house.

1462
01:00:54,674 --> 01:00:56,034
How could you do this to me?

1463
01:00:56,134 --> 01:00:58,868
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1464
01:00:58,968 --> 01:01:01,746
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1465
01:01:01,846 --> 01:01:05,026
I made a mistake. I don't know
what to tell you, babe. I...

1466
01:01:05,426 --> 01:01:06,698
I'm sorry.

1467
01:01:07,052 --> 01:01:09,405
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1468
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:21,209
Do you love her?

1469
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,382
Answer me.

1470
01:01:49,886 --> 01:01:52,034
<i>I felt horrible.</i>

1471
01:01:52,805 --> 01:01:54,756
<i>Three days later,
I filed for a divorce</i>

1472
01:01:54,856 --> 01:01:56,909
<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i>

1473
01:02:01,189 --> 01:02:02,347
<i>Say what you will,</i>

1474
01:02:02,447 --> 01:02:04,600
<i>but the Duchess did have style.</i>

1475
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,853
<i>She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.</i>

1476
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:09,980
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>

1477
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,941
<i>This guy was smart,</i>
<i>sophisticated, professional</i>

1478
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:14,719
<i>Really, really great.</i>

1479
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:16,141
Is that jasmine?

1480
01:02:16,412 --> 01:02:19,140
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1481
01:02:19,332 --> 01:02:21,033
Very good. Great nose.

1482
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:22,857
<i>Except for that one time.</i>

1483
01:02:28,174 --> 01:02:29,274
Oh, my God!

1484
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:32,452
Oh, hey.

1485
01:02:32,803 --> 01:02:34,246
Is it Wednesday already?

1486
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:36,464
- Uh...
- Oh, don't stop.

1487
01:02:36,564 --> 01:02:37,707
What the fuck!

1488
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:39,793
That is fucked up!

1489
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:41,427
He must have thought we were still

1490
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:43,094
at the Hamptons this weekend,
you know.

1491
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:44,554
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1492
01:02:44,654 --> 01:02:47,307
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1493
01:02:47,407 --> 01:02:48,642
There were more over here.

1494
01:02:48,742 --> 01:02:50,185
- There were four right here.
- Ugh!

1495
01:02:50,285 --> 01:02:51,937
Are you fucking serious?
Right there?

1496
01:02:52,037 --> 01:02:54,864
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1497
01:02:56,325 --> 01:02:58,934
After they left,
I checked the apartment.

1498
01:02:59,034 --> 01:03:00,142
Right. What?

1499
01:03:00,371 --> 01:03:02,348
What is it, babe? What?

1500
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:03,698
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1501
01:03:03,798 --> 01:03:04,790
I don't know where your money...

1502
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,868
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1503
01:03:06,968 --> 01:03:08,912
I don't know where your money is,
Mr. Belfort.

1504
01:03:09,012 --> 01:03:11,248
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1505
01:03:11,348 --> 01:03:12,624
He's lying through
his fucking teeth.

1506
01:03:12,724 --> 01:03:13,875
Let's start from the beginning.

1507
01:03:13,975 --> 01:03:15,168
Let's start from the
beginning, all right?

1508
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:16,912
You invited some
friends over, right?

1509
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,797
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1510
01:03:18,897 --> 01:03:20,340
We understand that, we do.

1511
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,884
We do blow all the time. We're
fucking degenerates ourselves.

1512
01:03:22,984 --> 01:03:24,052
Look at us, right?

1513
01:03:24,152 --> 01:03:25,719
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1514
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:27,346
Right from my sock drawer.
All right?

1515
01:03:27,446 --> 01:03:29,556
Like I said,
I don't know where your money is.

1516
01:03:29,656 --> 01:03:31,016
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1517
01:03:31,116 --> 01:03:32,142
It was just a normal day.

1518
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:33,519
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1519
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:35,896
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1520
01:03:35,996 --> 01:03:37,856
I got a little high at breakfast.

1521
01:03:37,956 --> 01:03:39,775
So I got a little happy.
I had some eggs,

1522
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:40,867
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1523
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:42,778
And then I said, "Who do I
know that likes ice cream?"

1524
01:03:42,878 --> 01:03:44,321
It's my friend, Rudy.
So I called Rudy.

1525
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:46,941
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1526
01:03:48,376 --> 01:03:51,704
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1527
01:03:51,804 --> 01:03:52,955
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1528
01:03:53,055 --> 01:03:54,081
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1529
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:55,207
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1530
01:03:55,307 --> 01:03:56,792
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1531
01:03:56,892 --> 01:03:58,991
You know who Rudy is?

1532
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:01,380
I don't fucking know any...

1533
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,451
What do you mean?

1534
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:03,590
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1535
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,259
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1536
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:06,885
On the stage, grinding
with everybody.

1537
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:08,583
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1538
01:04:09,105 --> 01:04:10,556
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1539
01:04:10,656 --> 01:04:12,334
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1540
01:04:12,525 --> 01:04:14,059
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1541
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:15,394
from my fucking sock drawer!

1542
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:16,979
All my girlfriend's
jewelry is gone.

1543
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:18,981
- Where the fuck is it?
- ...Rudy. What the fuck?

1544
01:04:19,081 --> 01:04:21,107
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1545
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:22,931
Did he? Answer me!

1546
01:04:23,118 --> 01:04:25,514
Okay. Now I get it.
Now I get why I'm...

1547
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:26,766
- This is a gay thing.
- Oh!

1548
01:04:26,912 --> 01:04:28,654
See, all of you...

1549
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:30,225
You think this is
'cause you're a fag?

1550
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,158
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1551
01:04:32,258 --> 01:04:34,577
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1552
01:04:34,677 --> 01:04:35,828
You were in charge, right?

1553
01:04:35,928 --> 01:04:37,580
I will not be stolen from.
You get that?

1554
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,874
I fucking like gay people.
I don't like you.

1555
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:41,250
He should've hired
a fucking Mexican

1556
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:42,653
like I have in my fucking house.

1557
01:04:44,304 --> 01:04:45,872
Shit! What the fuck...

1558
01:04:49,976 --> 01:04:51,385
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1559
01:04:51,485 --> 01:04:52,595
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1560
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:54,013
Where is it?

1561
01:04:54,113 --> 01:04:57,058
<i>Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i>

1562
01:04:57,158 --> 01:04:58,225
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i>

1563
01:04:58,325 --> 01:04:59,423
I don't know!

1564
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:03,095
<i>I had to call the cops just to
keep them from killing the poor guy.</i>

1565
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,607
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks</i>

1566
01:05:04,707 --> 01:05:06,852
<i>and told them what
Nicholas had done.</i>

1567
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:08,512
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i>

1568
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:10,351
Thanks again, Officer.

1569
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,282
<i>It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.</i>

1570
01:05:13,382 --> 01:05:14,950
<i>I was making that much
almost every day</i>

1571
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:17,327
<i>through one rathole or another.</i>

1572
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:20,163
<i>Now a rathole is a
friend, like Brad here,</i>

1573
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:22,791
<i>who held stock in his name for me.</i>

1574
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:25,126
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1575
01:05:25,226 --> 01:05:27,754
<i>I'd drive the price up
then he'd sell</i>

1576
01:05:27,854 --> 01:05:29,964
<i>and kick most of the
profits back to...</i>

1577
01:05:30,064 --> 01:05:31,992
<i>You guessed it, me.</i>

1578
01:05:34,645 --> 01:05:37,222
<i>All cash. None of
it's on the books.</i>

1579
01:05:37,322 --> 01:05:39,626
<i>A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.</i>

1580
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:43,679
<i>Enter our new securities attorney,
Manny Riskin.</i>

1581
01:05:44,155 --> 01:05:47,357
<i>700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.</i>

1582
01:05:47,457 --> 01:05:49,150
Listen to me.
You piss up the SEC's leg,

1583
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,485
you end up with your
tits in a ringer.

1584
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:53,640
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1585
01:05:53,914 --> 01:05:56,441
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1586
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:57,867
Hey! Hey!

1587
01:05:57,967 --> 01:05:59,327
What are you doing? Hey!

1588
01:05:59,427 --> 01:06:00,821
We got the SEC in here.

1589
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,456
<i>The Securities
and Exchange Commission</i>

1590
01:06:03,556 --> 01:06:06,126
<i>sent two lawyers down
to review our files.</i>

1591
01:06:06,226 --> 01:06:08,128
<i>So I set them up in
our conference room</i>

1592
01:06:08,227 --> 01:06:09,294
<i>and I had it bugged</i>

1593
01:06:09,394 --> 01:06:11,588
<i>and the air conditioning
turned up so high</i>

1594
01:06:11,688 --> 01:06:13,172
<i>that it felt like
Antarctica in there.</i>

1595
01:06:13,272 --> 01:06:15,258
Is it always this cold in here?

1596
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:16,350
I don't know.

1597
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,635
<i>Then, while they were looking</i>

1598
01:06:17,735 --> 01:06:19,137
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i>

1599
01:06:19,237 --> 01:06:21,086
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1600
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:24,350
<i>I was gonna fire off
a bazooka in here,</i>

1601
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,686
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i>

1602
01:06:26,786 --> 01:06:29,272
An IPO is an initial
public offering.

1603
01:06:29,372 --> 01:06:33,109
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1604
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:35,027
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1605
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:36,821
we set the initial sales price

1606
01:06:36,921 --> 01:06:39,691
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1607
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,367
Look.

1608
01:06:41,467 --> 01:06:43,357
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1609
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,371
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1610
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:47,290
The real question is this.

1611
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:49,250
"Was all this legal?"

1612
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,278
Absolutely fucking not.

1613
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:54,031
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1614
01:06:58,477 --> 01:06:59,510
<i>And what do you do
when you're making</i>

1615
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,334
<i>more money than you
know what to do with?</i>

1616
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,549
Oh, my God!

1617
01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:10,546
Will you marry me?

1618
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,397
Oh, my God.

1619
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:14,550
Is that a yes?

1620
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:16,234
Are you sure?

1621
01:07:16,334 --> 01:07:18,262
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1622
01:07:18,454 --> 01:07:20,022
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1623
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:34,203
<i>I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i>

1624
01:07:34,303 --> 01:07:36,639
<i>The flight there alone
was a bacchanal.</i>

1625
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:38,757
<i>One last blowout for the gods</i>

1626
01:07:38,857 --> 01:07:40,876
<i>before I settled down for good.</i>

1627
01:07:41,143 --> 01:07:42,594
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i>

1628
01:07:42,694 --> 01:07:45,589
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more
waiting once we landed.</i>

1629
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,224
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i>

1630
01:07:47,324 --> 01:07:51,221
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.</i>

1631
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,958
<i>All told, the weekend
cost me 2 million bucks,</i>

1632
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:29,080
<i>including the cost of refurbishing
the entire 28th floor.</i>

1633
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:31,481
kiss the bride.

1634
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,768
<i>Ah! But the wedding</i>

1635
01:08:34,868 --> 01:08:37,047
<i>was something out of a fairy tale.</i>

1636
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,148
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i>

1637
01:08:40,248 --> 01:08:41,733
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i>

1638
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:44,933
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.</i>

1639
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:58,584
<i>Of course, after the bachelor
party, me, the Duke,</i>

1640
01:08:58,684 --> 01:09:01,419
<i>needed a few penicillin shots
so he could</i>

1641
01:09:01,519 --> 01:09:03,698
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i>

1642
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:10,829
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1643
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,336
A few words for your son?

1644
01:09:12,436 --> 01:09:15,057
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1645
01:09:15,157 --> 01:09:18,269
It involves your penis
and her vagina.

1646
01:09:18,369 --> 01:09:21,390
And you know,
you know what you can do, Jordy.

1647
01:09:38,755 --> 01:09:40,122
Oh, my God!

1648
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:41,650
Aunt Emma?

1649
01:09:45,637 --> 01:09:47,739
I can't believe you came!

1650
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:51,413
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1651
01:09:52,102 --> 01:09:53,203
It's Aunt Emma.

1652
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,377
Aunt Emma.

1653
01:09:55,477 --> 01:09:57,881
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1654
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:01,423
It's a pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

1655
01:10:01,735 --> 01:10:03,353
Into the donuts, I see.

1656
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:05,730
Oh, I... I...

1657
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:06,882
Well...

1658
01:10:07,825 --> 01:10:10,193
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1659
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:11,812
Enjoy the day.

1660
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:14,310
She surprised me.
I didn't even know.

1661
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,088
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1662
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:31,756
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1663
01:10:31,856 --> 01:10:33,250
One, two, three!

1664
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:36,745
What is this?

1665
01:10:36,937 --> 01:10:37,933
It's your wedding present.

1666
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,055
What?

1667
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:41,425
It's your wedding present,
sweetheart.

1668
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:43,211
What?

1669
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:45,728
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1670
01:10:45,828 --> 01:10:46,926
A fucking yacht?

1671
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:49,941
<i>For millionaires
whose ships have come in,</i>

1672
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:52,777
<i>pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.</i>

1673
01:10:52,877 --> 01:10:55,987
<i>It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull</i>

1674
01:10:56,087 --> 01:10:58,240
<i>is the color of cash.
Anchors aweigh!</i>

1675
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,644
Oh, my God! Baby!

1676
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:04,538
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1677
01:11:04,638 --> 01:11:06,111
- You like it?
- Yes!

1678
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,506
<i>For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,</i>

1679
01:11:14,606 --> 01:11:16,591
<i>eventually taking her home
to Long Island,</i>

1680
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:17,757
<i>where we bought a house.</i>

1681
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,460
<i>Seven acres on the Gold Coast
of Long Island.</i>

1682
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,012
<i>The most expensive real estate
in the world.</i>

1683
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,765
<i>With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.</i>

1684
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,309
<i>We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.</i>

1685
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:29,803
<i>Both named Rocco.</i>

1686
01:11:33,574 --> 01:11:35,768
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

1687
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:39,988
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1688
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,823
- Ow!
- Who's Venice?

1689
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,241
- Huh?
"Who?

1690
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:44,333
Who? Who?

1691
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,077
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1692
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,370
Who is she?

1693
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,830
Some little hooker you
were fucking last night?

1694
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,831
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1695
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:52,541
No way, baby, no!

1696
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,950
You were calling her
name in your sleep!

1697
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,739
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I don't...

1698
01:11:58,181 --> 01:11:59,840
I don't even know who Venice is.

1699
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,176
What the fuck does that even mean?
Venice.

1700
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,080
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1701
01:12:08,733 --> 01:12:11,052
Venice...

1702
01:12:11,402 --> 01:12:13,630
Venice, baby, where are you?

1703
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,636
Venice!

1704
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:17,843
Venice!

1705
01:12:18,076 --> 01:12:19,576
Where'd you go?

1706
01:12:23,623 --> 01:12:26,366
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1707
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:28,710
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1708
01:12:30,922 --> 01:12:33,176
I like it. I like it. Ow.

1709
01:12:33,276 --> 01:12:35,000
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1710
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,071
Wolfie?

1711
01:12:36,171 --> 01:12:37,586
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1712
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,296
I don't give a fuck
about your safe word!

1713
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,256
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1714
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:43,785
- Ahh!
- Shut up, you little bitch!

1715
01:12:44,102 --> 01:12:46,260
You're a fucking
dirty little birdy!

1716
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,412
Owie!

1717
01:12:48,188 --> 01:12:49,460
That's right.

1718
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:50,807
That's right! I forgot.

1719
01:12:50,907 --> 01:12:52,384
I forgot, baby.

1720
01:12:52,484 --> 01:12:54,560
Donnie and I were investing

1721
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,771
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1722
01:12:56,871 --> 01:12:57,980
That's why all this confusion.

1723
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,565
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1724
01:12:59,665 --> 01:13:01,399
Not Italy. California.

1725
01:13:01,499 --> 01:13:02,984
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1726
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:04,194
You're a lying piece of shit!

1727
01:13:04,294 --> 01:13:05,445
Duchess, baby, come on.

1728
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:07,103
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1729
01:13:07,203 --> 01:13:08,740
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1730
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,857
Do you really think that I
don't know what you're up to?

1731
01:13:11,957 --> 01:13:13,829
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1732
01:13:13,929 --> 01:13:15,330
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1733
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:17,082
And you're still
acting like an infant!

1734
01:13:17,182 --> 01:13:19,907
God damn it!

1735
01:13:20,136 --> 01:13:22,910
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1736
01:13:23,306 --> 01:13:25,257
Who is the one who flew in here

1737
01:13:25,357 --> 01:13:28,218
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1738
01:13:28,318 --> 01:13:30,345
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1739
01:13:30,445 --> 01:13:33,124
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1740
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:45,144
<i>Does it even matter to you</i>

1741
01:13:45,244 --> 01:13:47,929
that I just had that driving range

1742
01:13:48,038 --> 01:13:51,156
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1743
01:13:51,256 --> 01:13:53,075
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1744
01:13:53,175 --> 01:13:55,024
No, you didn't research
the whole thing

1745
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:57,288
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1746
01:13:57,388 --> 01:13:58,539
Oh, my God,

1747
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:01,125
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1748
01:14:01,225 --> 01:14:03,953
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1749
01:14:04,053 --> 01:14:06,922
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1750
01:14:07,022 --> 01:14:08,215
What a fucking burden.

1751
01:14:08,315 --> 01:14:10,259
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1752
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:12,469
my fucking credit
card all day, huh?

1753
01:14:12,569 --> 01:14:15,264
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1754
01:14:15,364 --> 01:14:17,224
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1755
01:14:17,324 --> 01:14:19,310
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1756
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:21,103
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1757
01:14:21,203 --> 01:14:23,188
Don't fucking dare throw that

1758
01:14:23,288 --> 01:14:25,808
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1759
01:14:26,618 --> 01:14:28,140
All right, honey?

1760
01:14:28,453 --> 01:14:29,695
Now will you just...

1761
01:14:29,795 --> 01:14:31,655
We could talk this out, all right?

1762
01:14:31,755 --> 01:14:34,108
We just use our words. You know?

1763
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:35,284
Communicate.

1764
01:14:35,384 --> 01:14:36,652
Okay?

1765
01:14:37,087 --> 01:14:38,483
Come on, sweetheart.

1766
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:40,488
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1767
01:14:40,588 --> 01:14:42,624
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1768
01:14:42,724 --> 01:14:44,415
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1769
01:14:44,515 --> 01:14:45,507
Babe, come on.

1770
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:49,045
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1771
01:14:49,145 --> 01:14:51,449
who's in such great
shape like this, huh?

1772
01:14:52,224 --> 01:14:53,424
Come here.

1773
01:14:53,524 --> 01:14:55,009
Come on, give me a kiss.

1774
01:14:55,109 --> 01:14:56,177
You look so beautiful right now.

1775
01:14:56,277 --> 01:14:57,386
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1776
01:14:57,486 --> 01:14:58,638
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1777
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:00,416
Yeah, give me one...

1778
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:02,642
Fuck you!

1779
01:15:02,742 --> 01:15:04,795
<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i>

1780
01:15:05,195 --> 01:15:07,188
<i>First I'd get up and
fight with Naomi</i>

1781
01:15:07,288 --> 01:15:09,482
<i>about whatever it is I did
the night before.</i>

1782
01:15:09,582 --> 01:15:11,776
<i>Next was a steam so
I could sweat out</i>

1783
01:15:11,876 --> 01:15:13,611
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i>

1784
01:15:13,711 --> 01:15:15,389
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i>

1785
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:17,374
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i>

1786
01:15:17,474 --> 01:15:19,951
<i>Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,</i>

1787
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:22,196
<i>then seek to make up with Naomi.</i>

1788
01:15:22,462 --> 01:15:24,235
Good morning, Daddy.

1789
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:26,032
Where's my kiss?

1790
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:28,152
Whee!

1791
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,862
Hey, sweetheart.

1792
01:15:31,555 --> 01:15:34,547
Does Daddy get a kiss
from both of his little girls, huh?

1793
01:15:34,647 --> 01:15:36,007
Oh, no.

1794
01:15:36,107 --> 01:15:39,177
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1795
01:15:39,277 --> 01:15:41,080
for a very, very,

1796
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,916
very long time.

1797
01:15:43,357 --> 01:15:46,142
Daddy's really sorry about what
he said in the other room.

1798
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,435
He didn't mean any of it.

1799
01:15:47,535 --> 01:15:49,884
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1800
01:15:50,322 --> 01:15:52,015
And from now on,

1801
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:55,557
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1802
01:15:55,703 --> 01:15:58,022
short skirts around the house.

1803
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:03,110
And you know something else, Daddy?

1804
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:10,201
Mommy is just so sick and
tired of wearing panties.

1805
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:13,909
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1806
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:17,745
In fact,

1807
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:22,429
she's decided to throw them

1808
01:16:22,529 --> 01:16:25,754
all away.

1809
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,430
So take a good look, Daddy.

1810
01:16:33,781 --> 01:16:36,858
You're gonna be seeing an awful
lot of this around the house.

1811
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,484
Oh, baby...

1812
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:40,103
Yeah, Mommy.

1813
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:42,519
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1814
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,691
Oh, gosh.

1815
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,398
Ow.

1816
01:16:49,088 --> 01:16:50,830
What's wrong, Daddy?

1817
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,324
Mmm, baby.

1818
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,615
God!

1819
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,432
Look at this shit.

1820
01:16:58,532 --> 01:17:02,335
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1821
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,668
Mommy, have you ever noticed

1822
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:08,624
anything odd about Mr...

1823
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:10,717
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1824
01:17:12,778 --> 01:17:16,007
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1825
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:19,901
Yeah, there's something a little
bit different about his eyes.

1826
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:23,154
Yes!
I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1827
01:17:23,254 --> 01:17:25,114
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1828
01:17:25,214 --> 01:17:26,573
<i>- Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.</i>

1829
01:17:26,673 --> 01:17:27,991
See that, huh?

1830
01:17:28,091 --> 01:17:29,826
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i>

1831
01:17:29,926 --> 01:17:31,775
<i>she chooses today to
give me blue balls!</i>

1832
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:34,873
<i>I mean, today was the biggest day
in Stratton's history,</i>

1833
01:17:34,973 --> 01:17:36,792
<i>and I needed to be
thinking straight.</i>

1834
01:17:36,892 --> 01:17:38,320
Hey, Jordan!

1835
01:17:38,594 --> 01:17:40,462
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1836
01:17:40,562 --> 01:17:43,725
<i>This was the day that we
launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i>

1837
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,884
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1838
01:17:45,984 --> 01:17:47,761
<i>Everything had to run tight.</i>

1839
01:17:47,861 --> 01:17:48,887
<i>It had to be perfect.</i>

1840
01:17:48,987 --> 01:17:50,631
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1841
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:52,842
What's he doing?

1842
01:17:53,484 --> 01:17:55,461
The biggest IPO in
this firm's history.

1843
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,843
What the fuck is he doing?

1844
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:00,841
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1845
01:18:01,033 --> 01:18:02,225
Hi.

1846
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:04,361
How're you doing?

1847
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:05,559
Good.

1848
01:18:06,372 --> 01:18:08,270
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1849
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,442
I just... I had a minute and...

1850
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,227
You had a minute.

1851
01:18:13,419 --> 01:18:15,787
And today you needed to
clean the fish bowl? Today?

1852
01:18:15,887 --> 01:18:19,594
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1853
01:18:19,694 --> 01:18:21,527
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1854
01:18:27,473 --> 01:18:28,825
On new issue day?

1855
01:18:30,393 --> 01:18:33,023
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1856
01:18:33,123 --> 01:18:34,376
This is what you do?

1857
01:18:34,814 --> 01:18:37,337
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1858
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:40,587
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1859
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:56,110
Take your little bow tie,
get your shit,

1860
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:58,203
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1861
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,856
Get the fuck out!

1862
01:19:03,426 --> 01:19:04,960
Everybody on point!

1863
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,035
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1864
01:19:10,433 --> 01:19:13,218
<i>A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.</i>

1865
01:19:13,318 --> 01:19:15,929
Jordan, look what I caught in
the lobby. I caught a genius.

1866
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:17,506
<i>Enter Steve Madden.</i>

1867
01:19:17,606 --> 01:19:18,681
The great American cobbler.

1868
01:19:18,781 --> 01:19:21,210
<i>Red-hot ladies footwear Impresario.</i>

1869
01:19:21,652 --> 01:19:24,812
<i>And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.</i>

1870
01:19:24,912 --> 01:19:28,684
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling
out of the primordial ooze.</i>

1871
01:19:28,825 --> 01:19:30,768
<i>Pond scum no more.</i>

1872
01:19:30,994 --> 01:19:32,278
That's why they gotta
see your face.

1873
01:19:32,378 --> 01:19:34,864
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1874
01:19:34,964 --> 01:19:37,533
<i>And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned</i>

1875
01:19:37,633 --> 01:19:39,937
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i>

1876
01:19:40,462 --> 01:19:42,455
<i>which legally speaking
was a big no-no,</i>

1877
01:19:42,555 --> 01:19:46,031
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.</i>

1878
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,596
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i>

1879
01:19:48,696 --> 01:19:50,577
<i>- But not too worked up.</i>
- Shh.

1880
01:19:52,015 --> 01:19:53,787
Hello. If, uh...

1881
01:19:54,225 --> 01:19:56,453
For those of you who don't know me,
uh...

1882
01:19:56,686 --> 01:19:57,761
My name's Steve Madden.

1883
01:19:57,861 --> 01:19:59,596
Yeah, we know who you are.

1884
01:19:59,696 --> 01:20:01,044
Your name is on the box.

1885
01:20:01,148 --> 01:20:02,724
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1886
01:20:02,824 --> 01:20:04,468
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1887
01:20:04,652 --> 01:20:07,646
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1888
01:20:07,746 --> 01:20:10,607
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1889
01:20:10,707 --> 01:20:12,275
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1890
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:13,526
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1891
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:15,603
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1892
01:20:15,703 --> 01:20:17,196
the Mary Lou is actually the same

1893
01:20:17,296 --> 01:20:19,039
as the Mary Jane, but
it's black leather.

1894
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1895
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:27,278
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1896
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:29,833
All right!

1897
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:33,212
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1898
01:20:33,312 --> 01:20:35,491
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1899
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:38,084
Give him a round of applause!

1900
01:20:39,185 --> 01:20:41,413
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1901
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:44,332
You having a good
afternoon or what?

1902
01:20:44,816 --> 01:20:47,893
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1903
01:20:47,993 --> 01:20:50,342
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1904
01:20:51,448 --> 01:20:53,175
It's because this man

1905
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,143
is a creative genius.

1906
01:20:55,577 --> 01:20:57,569
This ability, this gift

1907
01:20:57,669 --> 01:20:59,184
that Steve has,

1908
01:20:59,284 --> 01:21:00,781
it goes beyond just

1909
01:21:00,881 --> 01:21:02,533
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1910
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:06,484
Steve's power is that
he creates trends.

1911
01:21:06,713 --> 01:21:07,860
You understand?

1912
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,456
Artists like Steve come along
once every decade.

1913
01:21:10,556 --> 01:21:13,960
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1914
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,704
Yves Saint Laurent.

1915
01:21:16,096 --> 01:21:17,823
Steve, come over here for a second.

1916
01:21:17,931 --> 01:21:20,079
I don't think you all realize

1917
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,119
that Steve Madden

1918
01:21:22,353 --> 01:21:25,680
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1919
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,056
with orders going through the roof

1920
01:21:27,156 --> 01:21:30,552
at every department store
in North America right now.

1921
01:21:30,944 --> 01:21:33,046
We have him here in our office!

1922
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:36,816
We should thank our fucking
lucky stars this man is here!

1923
01:21:36,914 --> 01:21:39,483
We should be
on our hands and knees right now,

1924
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,652
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1925
01:21:41,752 --> 01:21:43,020
Like this! Okay?

1926
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:46,225
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1927
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,693
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1928
01:21:49,378 --> 01:21:50,578
This is our golden ticket

1929
01:21:50,678 --> 01:21:52,755
to the fucking chocolate factory
right here!

1930
01:21:53,882 --> 01:21:55,029
And I wanna meet

1931
01:21:55,133 --> 01:21:57,452
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1932
01:21:58,011 --> 01:22:00,955
I wanna be with the
fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

1933
01:22:04,935 --> 01:22:07,412
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1934
01:22:07,895 --> 01:22:10,339
All right, I want you all
to focus for a second.

1935
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:12,875
See those little black boxes?

1936
01:22:12,983 --> 01:22:14,100
They're called telephones.

1937
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,978
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1938
01:22:17,078 --> 01:22:19,681
They're not gonna dial themselves.
Okay?

1939
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:23,561
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1940
01:22:24,078 --> 01:22:27,773
Like a loaded M16 without a trained
Marine to pull the trigger.

1941
01:22:28,707 --> 01:22:31,211
And in the case of the telephone,

1942
01:22:31,311 --> 01:22:34,021
it's up to each and
every one of you,

1943
01:22:35,423 --> 01:22:37,617
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1944
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:40,031
My killers!

1945
01:22:40,678 --> 01:22:44,078
My killers,
who will not take no for an answer!

1946
01:22:44,849 --> 01:22:46,542
My fucking warriors,

1947
01:22:46,892 --> 01:22:48,927
who will not hang up the phone

1948
01:22:49,027 --> 01:22:51,971
until their client either buys

1949
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:54,274
or fucking dies!

1950
01:23:09,205 --> 01:23:10,823
Let me tell you something.

1951
01:23:10,923 --> 01:23:13,978
There is no nobility in poverty.

1952
01:23:14,335 --> 01:23:17,371
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1953
01:23:17,471 --> 01:23:19,423
And I choose rich
every fucking time.

1954
01:23:21,091 --> 01:23:22,333
Because at least as a rich man,

1955
01:23:22,433 --> 01:23:23,793
when I have to face my problems,

1956
01:23:23,893 --> 01:23:25,753
I show up in the back of a limo,

1957
01:23:25,853 --> 01:23:27,672
wearing a $2,000 suit

1958
01:23:27,772 --> 01:23:30,451
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1959
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:35,721
Duke it out! Hit him!

1960
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:37,294
Get the fuck off me!

1961
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:41,302
And if anyone here
thinks I'm superficial

1962
01:23:41,402 --> 01:23:42,854
or materialistic,

1963
01:23:42,954 --> 01:23:45,231
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1964
01:23:45,331 --> 01:23:47,430
'cause that's where
you fucking belong!

1965
01:23:49,411 --> 01:23:53,015
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1966
01:23:53,749 --> 01:23:54,991
I want you to take a good look

1967
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:56,815
at the person next to you. Go on.

1968
01:23:57,836 --> 01:24:00,188
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1969
01:24:00,505 --> 01:24:01,913
you're gonna be pulling
up to a red light

1970
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:04,032
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1971
01:24:04,258 --> 01:24:07,377
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1972
01:24:07,477 --> 01:24:09,656
in their brand new Porsche

1973
01:24:10,389 --> 01:24:12,424
with their beautiful
wife by their side,

1974
01:24:12,524 --> 01:24:14,017
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1975
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:18,388
And who're you gonna
be sitting next to?

1976
01:24:18,488 --> 01:24:20,223
Some disgusting wildebeest

1977
01:24:20,323 --> 01:24:21,808
with three days of razor-stubble,

1978
01:24:21,908 --> 01:24:23,226
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1979
01:24:23,326 --> 01:24:25,687
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1980
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:27,522
from the fucking Price Club!

1981
01:24:27,622 --> 01:24:29,900
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1982
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,235
So you listen to me
and you listen well.

1983
01:24:32,335 --> 01:24:34,639
Are you behind on your
credit card bills?

1984
01:24:34,956 --> 01:24:37,229
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1985
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:40,191
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1986
01:24:40,378 --> 01:24:42,579
Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1987
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:45,957
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1988
01:24:46,057 --> 01:24:48,952
Good! Pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1989
01:24:49,178 --> 01:24:51,389
I want you to deal
with your problems

1990
01:24:51,489 --> 01:24:52,681
by becoming rich!

1991
01:24:54,849 --> 01:24:56,675
All you have to do today

1992
01:24:56,775 --> 01:24:58,248
is pick up that phone

1993
01:24:59,312 --> 01:25:01,881
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1994
01:25:02,482 --> 01:25:04,507
And I will make you richer

1995
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:06,058
than the most powerful CEO

1996
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:07,643
in the United States
of fucking America!

1997
01:25:07,743 --> 01:25:09,296
Yeah!

1998
01:25:09,988 --> 01:25:11,385
Fuck, yeah!

1999
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:14,100
I want you to go out there

2000
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:16,594
and I want you to ram

2001
01:25:16,828 --> 01:25:20,155
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

2002
01:25:20,255 --> 01:25:22,604
until they fucking choke on it!

2003
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:25,035
Till they choke on it and they buy

2004
01:25:25,135 --> 01:25:27,204
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

2005
01:25:27,304 --> 01:25:28,789
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

2006
01:25:28,889 --> 01:25:30,613
You be ferocious!

2007
01:25:30,717 --> 01:25:32,575
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

2008
01:25:32,675 --> 01:25:36,035
You be telephone
fucking terrorists!

2009
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:41,018
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

2010
01:26:11,298 --> 01:26:16,099
<i>At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i>

2011
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:19,287
<i>By 1:03, it was over $18.</i>

2012
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:21,746
<i>Even the big Wall Street firms
were buying.</i>

2013
01:26:31,568 --> 01:26:33,519
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

2014
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:36,522
a million belonged to me, held in
phony accounts by my ratholes.

2015
01:26:36,622 --> 01:26:38,850
Now once the price hit
the high teens...

2016
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:41,110
You know what? Who gives a shit?

2017
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:42,888
As always, the point is this.

2018
01:26:43,246 --> 01:26:47,723
$22 million in three fucking hours!

2019
01:26:48,749 --> 01:26:50,726
Can you believe this shit?

2020
01:26:50,918 --> 01:26:53,161
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

2021
01:26:53,261 --> 01:26:54,438
Jordan!

2022
01:26:54,755 --> 01:26:56,039
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

2023
01:26:56,139 --> 01:26:57,790
- from Future Video.
- Who?

2024
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:59,083
I don't know.
He shot at your wedding.

2025
01:26:59,183 --> 01:27:00,209
He says it's urgent.

2026
01:27:00,309 --> 01:27:02,420
Urgent?
Who the fuck is Barry Kleinman?

2027
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,088
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

2028
01:27:04,188 --> 01:27:05,214
You're in love with me?

2029
01:27:05,314 --> 01:27:06,372
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

2030
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:07,469
Hey, Barry, what's up?

2031
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:09,677
Listen, I got this subpoena.

2032
01:27:09,777 --> 01:27:11,220
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

2033
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,805
Yeah, the FBI, they want a copy

2034
01:27:12,905 --> 01:27:13,931
of your wedding video.

2035
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:15,254
<i>The fucking FBI?</i>

2036
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:17,226
- You fucking kidding me?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

2037
01:27:17,326 --> 01:27:18,603
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

2038
01:27:18,703 --> 01:27:20,355
<i>He's an agent with
the New York office.</i>

2039
01:27:20,455 --> 01:27:21,481
<i>What's his problem?</i>

2040
01:27:21,581 --> 01:27:24,260
<i>He's a Boy Scout. He thinks
you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i>

2041
01:27:25,452 --> 01:27:26,736
What does he want
with my wedding video?

2042
01:27:26,836 --> 01:27:28,446
It's like an invasion
of my privacy.

2043
01:27:28,546 --> 01:27:29,898
You know what I'm saying?
It's like...

2044
01:27:29,998 --> 01:27:31,282
It's intrusive, you know.

2045
01:27:31,382 --> 01:27:34,035
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

2046
01:27:34,135 --> 01:27:35,953
Pictures, names of the people.

2047
01:27:36,053 --> 01:27:37,045
You know what he's trying to do?

2048
01:27:37,145 --> 01:27:38,247
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

2049
01:27:38,347 --> 01:27:39,540
He's trying to rattle you,

2050
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,084
he's trying to rattle
your old lady,

2051
01:27:41,184 --> 01:27:43,919
so she nags you
until you become a fucking witness.

2052
01:27:44,019 --> 01:27:45,420
He wants me to rat on myself?

2053
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,414
He wants me
to give information about my...

2054
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,257
Listen. The good fucking news is,

2055
01:27:49,357 --> 01:27:51,093
you know I know everybody downtown,

2056
01:27:51,193 --> 01:27:53,428
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

2057
01:27:53,528 --> 01:27:56,674
nobody even knows you fucking
exist, so calm down!

2058
01:27:56,858 --> 01:27:58,175
They don't know I exist?

2059
01:27:58,317 --> 01:28:00,090
- No.
- That's good.

2060
01:28:04,991 --> 01:28:06,066
But you...

2061
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:07,685
You know who he is, right?

2062
01:28:08,327 --> 01:28:10,320
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

2063
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,364
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

2064
01:28:12,464 --> 01:28:15,617
you could go to his house, right?

2065
01:28:15,717 --> 01:28:17,619
Tap his phones a
little bit, bug him.

2066
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:18,787
You could get some information...

2067
01:28:18,887 --> 01:28:21,707
You don't fuck with
these guys like that.

2068
01:28:21,807 --> 01:28:22,874
You don't fuck with them like that.

2069
01:28:22,974 --> 01:28:24,126
What are you, nuts or something?

2070
01:28:24,226 --> 01:28:25,836
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

2071
01:28:25,936 --> 01:28:29,005
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

2072
01:28:29,105 --> 01:28:30,130
I'm not a cop anymore.

2073
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:32,257
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

2074
01:28:32,357 --> 01:28:33,455
Okay.

2075
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:36,454
Okay, if I can't do that,
can I just...

2076
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:37,997
Can I give the guy a call?

2077
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,140
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

2078
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,232
Do me a favor?

2079
01:28:42,332 --> 01:28:45,227
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

2080
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:46,319
I can't call him, right?

2081
01:28:46,419 --> 01:28:48,147
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

2082
01:28:48,247 --> 01:28:49,898
whatever the fuck you say to him,

2083
01:28:49,998 --> 01:28:52,609
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

2084
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:54,445
He's smart, you're dumb.

2085
01:28:54,545 --> 01:28:55,813
Fucking bullshit.

2086
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,573
Are we fucking talking tonight,

2087
01:28:57,673 --> 01:28:58,824
or are you gonna get schwacked?

2088
01:28:58,924 --> 01:29:00,492
The last time you took
these fucking pills,

2089
01:29:00,592 --> 01:29:03,023
you put your head in the fucking
macaroni. I had to pick it up.

2090
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,122
All right.

2091
01:29:05,222 --> 01:29:06,900
Okay, I won't call him.

2092
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:11,754
Hey, fellas! Come on board.

2093
01:29:11,854 --> 01:29:13,657
The plank's right around there.

2094
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,784
Welcome!

2095
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,869
Whoo! What a nice day.

2096
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:21,046
Hey.

2097
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:22,794
Welcome aboard.

2098
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:25,142
Jordan. Welcome aboard the <i>Naomi.</i>

2099
01:29:25,242 --> 01:29:26,268
Pleasure to meet you.

2100
01:29:26,368 --> 01:29:27,770
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

2101
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:28,896
Hi, how are you?

2102
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:32,232
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

2103
01:29:32,332 --> 01:29:34,817
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

2104
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:36,068
These are friends of Stratton.

2105
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:37,351
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

2106
01:29:37,451 --> 01:29:39,685
Um...

2107
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,839
Your message said
that you wanted to speak privately.

2108
01:29:43,939 --> 01:29:45,695
Right. I do want to
speak privately.

2109
01:29:45,795 --> 01:29:47,151
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

2110
01:29:47,339 --> 01:29:48,706
Let me know if I can
get you anything.

2111
01:29:48,806 --> 01:29:50,109
We'd be happy to help.

2112
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:51,876
You guys hungry?

2113
01:29:51,976 --> 01:29:52,968
Want something to eat?

2114
01:29:53,068 --> 01:29:54,796
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2115
01:29:54,896 --> 01:29:57,215
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2116
01:29:57,315 --> 01:29:58,800
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2117
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,419
to drink while we're at sea.

2118
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:01,662
Duh! Of course.

2119
01:30:02,938 --> 01:30:04,877
Ever been on one of these before?

2120
01:30:04,977 --> 01:30:06,337
A boat?

2121
01:30:06,942 --> 01:30:08,309
I learned how to
sail when I was six.

2122
01:30:08,409 --> 01:30:10,478
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2123
01:30:10,578 --> 01:30:12,271
On one like this, though?

2124
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:15,180
I had the whole front extended in
order to fit the chopper up there.

2125
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,638
See that?

2126
01:30:17,827 --> 01:30:19,194
Anyway, this is for you.

2127
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:22,239
It's a complete list of every
person that was at my wedding.

2128
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:25,075
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2129
01:30:25,175 --> 01:30:27,911
Figured this would help
expedite the whole process, right?

2130
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:29,746
- There you go.
- Look,

2131
01:30:29,846 --> 01:30:30,996
my point is that

2132
01:30:31,096 --> 01:30:32,748
I know you're
investigating Stratton.

2133
01:30:32,848 --> 01:30:36,403
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2134
01:30:36,636 --> 01:30:38,838
I know we're a little unorthodox,
we're a little

2135
01:30:38,938 --> 01:30:40,923
loud in the way we do things.
But you gotta understand,

2136
01:30:41,023 --> 01:30:42,299
we're the new guys on the block,
you know,

2137
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:44,999
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2138
01:30:45,145 --> 01:30:47,754
But I want you to
understand, we don't

2139
01:30:47,854 --> 01:30:49,587
do anything illegal.

2140
01:30:50,317 --> 01:30:51,433
Whatsoever.

2141
01:30:51,533 --> 01:30:53,060
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2142
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:56,105
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2143
01:30:56,205 --> 01:30:58,600
I mean, I got...
I got nothing to hide.

2144
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,735
Well, you know the SEC is
a civil regulatory agency.

2145
01:31:01,835 --> 01:31:03,362
We pursue criminal activities.

2146
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:06,357
Exactly! You go after
real criminals, which

2147
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:09,285
makes me wonder what the hell
you're investigating me for?

2148
01:31:09,385 --> 01:31:11,359
I mean, honestly...

2149
01:31:11,588 --> 01:31:15,332
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2150
01:31:15,432 --> 01:31:16,667
Well, I...

2151
01:31:16,767 --> 01:31:19,128
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2152
01:31:19,228 --> 01:31:20,955
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2153
01:31:21,055 --> 01:31:22,536
With that said...

2154
01:31:23,266 --> 01:31:25,134
This case got dumped on my desk...

2155
01:31:25,234 --> 01:31:26,802
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2156
01:31:26,901 --> 01:31:28,136
who needs to make a show

2157
01:31:28,236 --> 01:31:30,346
of looking into the new company
on the block,

2158
01:31:30,446 --> 01:31:31,874
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2159
01:31:32,274 --> 01:31:33,725
And then I end up being the schmuck

2160
01:31:33,825 --> 01:31:35,476
who does the looking. Exactly.

2161
01:31:35,576 --> 01:31:37,562
It's just, you know...
It bothers me.

2162
01:31:37,662 --> 01:31:38,980
We're the new guy. We're the one

2163
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,357
that's banging on Wall Street's door.
I mean, you should...

2164
01:31:41,457 --> 01:31:43,318
You should see what's going
on at the bigger firms.

2165
01:31:43,418 --> 01:31:44,954
I mean, I know all the information.

2166
01:31:45,054 --> 01:31:48,016
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2167
01:31:48,207 --> 01:31:49,983
Collateralized debt obligations?

2168
01:31:50,083 --> 01:31:51,326
This Internet stock bullshit?

2169
01:31:51,426 --> 01:31:53,202
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2170
01:31:53,302 --> 01:31:55,455
I could take you step-by-step

2171
01:31:55,555 --> 01:31:58,323
through what exactly is occurring.

2172
01:31:58,507 --> 01:32:00,179
All you have to do is ask.

2173
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:01,636
I'm available.

2174
01:32:01,736 --> 01:32:03,336
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

2175
01:32:03,436 --> 01:32:06,366
I don't see why a
little sitdown like this

2176
01:32:06,932 --> 01:32:08,507
can't be profitable
for the both of us.

2177
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:10,843
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2178
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:12,541
- It should.
- Look.

2179
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:15,222
I'm gonna give you
my personal line.

2180
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:18,297
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2181
01:32:18,402 --> 01:32:20,220
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2182
01:32:22,698 --> 01:32:24,397
Are you sure you guys don't
want something to drink?

2183
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,149
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2184
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,927
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2185
01:32:30,955 --> 01:32:32,030
Let me ask you,

2186
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,531
and if you don't wanna
get too personal,

2187
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:35,855
- just tell me to shut up at any time.
- Oh.

2188
01:32:36,794 --> 01:32:39,454
Did you try to get
your broker's license at one time?

2189
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,449
Did I hear that right? Were you
trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2190
01:32:43,259 --> 01:32:45,210
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2191
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,302
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2192
01:32:46,402 --> 01:32:47,420
Well, you're investigating me.

2193
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,964
I hear things.

2194
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:50,458
You know what I mean?

2195
01:32:51,475 --> 01:32:52,968
You ever think about
what would've happened

2196
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:55,713
if you would have
stayed the course?

2197
01:32:56,897 --> 01:32:58,723
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2198
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,100
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2199
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,977
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2200
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,561
Yeah, you bet I do.

2201
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,397
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2202
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:06,523
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2203
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,691
What do you get...

2204
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,025
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2205
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,485
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2206
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,645
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2207
01:33:13,745 --> 01:33:15,740
- A year? In the ballpark?
- Oh.

2208
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,283
Well, I...

2209
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,159
Let's put it this way.

2210
01:33:19,259 --> 01:33:20,452
You get a free handgun

2211
01:33:20,552 --> 01:33:22,383
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2212
01:33:22,672 --> 01:33:24,915
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2213
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:27,167
You think about the people
that built this country,

2214
01:33:27,267 --> 01:33:28,669
hardworking people like you.

2215
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:31,329
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2216
01:33:31,429 --> 01:33:35,092
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2217
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:37,052
It fucking makes me angry.

2218
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:40,211
Now the one thing about Wall Street
and this market is,

2219
01:33:40,311 --> 01:33:42,045
for me, I feel

2220
01:33:42,983 --> 01:33:45,393
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2221
01:33:45,493 --> 01:33:47,645
There are situations where I can

2222
01:33:47,745 --> 01:33:51,274
make those situations better
for people. You know?

2223
01:33:51,374 --> 01:33:52,650
You know what I mean.

2224
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,223
Opportunity

2225
01:33:54,661 --> 01:33:55,695
is everything.

2226
01:33:55,795 --> 01:33:57,060
Exactly.

2227
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,615
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2228
01:33:59,715 --> 01:34:03,453
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2229
01:34:03,553 --> 01:34:05,371
He was bogged down
by student loans.

2230
01:34:05,471 --> 01:34:07,874
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

2231
01:34:07,974 --> 01:34:09,625
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2232
01:34:09,725 --> 01:34:10,717
Sure.

2233
01:34:10,817 --> 01:34:11,878
But we got him into the market

2234
01:34:11,978 --> 01:34:13,629
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2235
01:34:13,729 --> 01:34:15,464
We gave him the right guidance.

2236
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:18,289
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2237
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:20,385
Got to put his mother into

2238
01:34:20,485 --> 01:34:22,220
the best hospital in New York City.

2239
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,388
It didn't work out for her,

2240
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,182
granted, she passed
away, unfortunately.

2241
01:34:25,282 --> 01:34:27,142
But we gave him that opportunity.

2242
01:34:27,242 --> 01:34:28,465
You know what I'm saying?

2243
01:34:29,112 --> 01:34:30,812
It's just about setting
up the right team,

2244
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:33,716
and then overnight
your life can change.

2245
01:34:38,996 --> 01:34:41,519
What does... What does an intern...

2246
01:34:42,959 --> 01:34:44,826
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2247
01:34:44,926 --> 01:34:47,025
Well, in that situation,

2248
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:51,029
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2249
01:34:51,217 --> 01:34:53,866
north of half a million dollars.

2250
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:59,674
And I'd do that for
anybody, you know,

2251
01:34:59,774 --> 01:35:02,499
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2252
01:35:22,205 --> 01:35:24,305
Can you say that again,

2253
01:35:24,664 --> 01:35:26,232
just the way you said it?

2254
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:28,526
Just the same way.

2255
01:35:30,211 --> 01:35:31,403
Oh.

2256
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:33,705
I don't know what
you're talking about.

2257
01:35:33,805 --> 01:35:35,699
Oh, come on!
You know what I'm talking about.

2258
01:35:36,426 --> 01:35:38,159
I think what Jordan
just did is he...

2259
01:35:38,259 --> 01:35:39,378
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2260
01:35:39,478 --> 01:35:41,588
you just tried to
bribe a federal officer.

2261
01:35:41,688 --> 01:35:43,757
No, technically I
didn't bribe anybody.

2262
01:35:43,857 --> 01:35:46,260
No, no, that's not the conversation
I heard, Jordan.

2263
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,845
No, no, according to
the U.S. criminal code,

2264
01:35:47,945 --> 01:35:49,763
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure

2265
01:35:49,863 --> 01:35:51,348
- for the exchange of services.
- Oh!

2266
01:35:51,448 --> 01:35:53,058
That would not hold
up in a court of law.

2267
01:35:53,158 --> 01:35:54,810
Nah, it's not howl heard it.

2268
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:57,563
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2269
01:35:57,663 --> 01:35:58,689
Yeah.

2270
01:35:58,789 --> 01:36:00,274
The same gentleman that told me

2271
01:36:00,374 --> 01:36:02,109
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2272
01:36:02,209 --> 01:36:04,350
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2273
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:05,904
He ran a security check on me.

2274
01:36:06,004 --> 01:36:07,181
Well...

2275
01:36:07,289 --> 01:36:10,283
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2276
01:36:10,383 --> 01:36:12,562
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2277
01:36:13,795 --> 01:36:15,746
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2278
01:36:15,846 --> 01:36:17,865
What do you say? Hmm?

2279
01:36:18,175 --> 01:36:19,417
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2280
01:36:19,517 --> 01:36:22,572
Most of the Wall Street jackasses
that I bust,

2281
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:25,298
they're to the manor born.

2282
01:36:25,398 --> 01:36:26,465
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2283
01:36:26,565 --> 01:36:28,176
Their fathers are douchebags,

2284
01:36:28,276 --> 01:36:30,250
just like their
fathers before them.

2285
01:36:31,271 --> 01:36:32,748
But you...

2286
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:36,778
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2287
01:36:36,878 --> 01:36:38,048
Did I?

2288
01:36:38,148 --> 01:36:40,240
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2289
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,606
Good for you.

2290
01:36:41,706 --> 01:36:42,857
Me, the little man?

2291
01:36:42,957 --> 01:36:43,983
And let me tell you something.

2292
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:46,102
Let me tell you something else.

2293
01:36:46,328 --> 01:36:48,279
Honestly,
I'm not bullshitting here,

2294
01:36:48,379 --> 01:36:49,447
this is one of the nicest boats

2295
01:36:49,547 --> 01:36:51,574
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2296
01:36:51,674 --> 01:36:53,305
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2297
01:36:53,543 --> 01:36:56,495
The fucking hero that I'm
gonna be back at the office

2298
01:36:56,595 --> 01:36:58,779
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2299
01:36:58,879 --> 01:37:01,042
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2300
01:37:01,142 --> 01:37:02,710
look at this thing!

2301
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:03,801
It's beautiful!

2302
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:06,879
And you got the beautiful
girls there. It's wonderful.

2303
01:37:06,979 --> 01:37:09,453
All right, get the
fuck off my boat.

2304
01:37:09,557 --> 01:37:11,133
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2305
01:37:11,233 --> 01:37:12,259
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2306
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:13,802
Good luck on that subway ride home

2307
01:37:13,902 --> 01:37:15,804
to your miserable,
ugly fucking wives.

2308
01:37:15,904 --> 01:37:18,974
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some
caviar off my balls in the meantime.

2309
01:37:19,074 --> 01:37:21,727
Hey, you guys want to take some
lobsters for your ride home?

2310
01:37:21,827 --> 01:37:24,438
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2311
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:26,387
Fucking cheap fucks.

2312
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,954
Fucking miserable pricks.

2313
01:37:29,054 --> 01:37:32,238
Hey, fellas! Look what I
found in my pocket! Look!

2314
01:37:32,338 --> 01:37:34,073
A year's salary right here.

2315
01:37:34,173 --> 01:37:36,825
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2316
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:38,228
See that!

2317
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:40,772
They're fun coupons!

2318
01:37:48,513 --> 01:37:51,290
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2319
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:53,384
<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i>

2320
01:37:53,484 --> 01:37:56,209
<i>It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.</i>

2321
01:37:57,397 --> 01:37:58,982
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>

2322
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,682
<i>He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.</i>

2323
01:38:00,782 --> 01:38:01,849
That's for European pussy!

2324
01:38:01,949 --> 01:38:03,184
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>

2325
01:38:03,284 --> 01:38:05,679
<i>And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>

2326
01:38:07,406 --> 01:38:09,107
<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i>

2327
01:38:09,207 --> 01:38:11,306
<i>I could sleep through
the entire flight.</i>

2328
01:38:11,618 --> 01:38:14,062
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>

2329
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,644
<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped
a few more ludes,</i>

2330
01:38:16,744 --> 01:38:18,199
<i>which started kicking
in by the time</i>

2331
01:38:18,299 --> 01:38:20,102
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>

2332
01:38:20,252 --> 01:38:21,569
<i>My tingle phase.</i>

2333
01:38:21,754 --> 01:38:23,496
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>

2334
01:38:23,596 --> 01:38:26,552
<i>on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.</i>

2335
01:38:26,652 --> 01:38:28,201
<i>My slur phase.</i>

2336
01:38:30,262 --> 01:38:32,706
<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i>

2337
01:38:32,848 --> 01:38:35,542
<i>and pretty much lost
all my motor skills.</i>

2338
01:38:35,684 --> 01:38:37,286
<i>This was the drool phase.</i>

2339
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:43,641
<i>And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.</i>

2340
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:45,385
<i>The amnesia phase.</i>

2341
01:38:46,195 --> 01:38:48,187
<i>We boarded the plane
just before midnight.</i>

2342
01:38:48,287 --> 01:38:49,979
Wow! Look at you!

2343
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:52,098
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2344
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:54,400
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2345
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,026
May I see your
boarding passes, sir?

2346
01:38:56,126 --> 01:38:57,874
We have the boarding passes.

2347
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:00,055
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2348
01:39:00,581 --> 01:39:02,378
Hey! Fucking relax.

2349
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:04,576
Oh, my God! You got your
hand on my fucking cock!

2350
01:39:04,676 --> 01:39:06,036
I don't. Cut it out.

2351
01:39:06,136 --> 01:39:07,107
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2352
01:39:07,207 --> 01:39:08,204
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2353
01:39:08,304 --> 01:39:09,497
You got your hand on his dick?

2354
01:39:09,597 --> 01:39:11,531
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2355
01:39:11,631 --> 01:39:13,660
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2356
01:39:13,803 --> 01:39:14,878
Take it off!

2357
01:39:14,978 --> 01:39:17,999
I heard there's a treasure map
under here.

2358
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:20,342
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2359
01:39:20,442 --> 01:39:21,915
Please sit down.

2360
01:39:22,103 --> 01:39:23,428
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2361
01:39:23,528 --> 01:39:25,877
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2362
01:39:26,232 --> 01:39:27,766
I will have to call the captain.

2363
01:39:27,866 --> 01:39:30,393
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2364
01:39:30,493 --> 01:39:32,145
- Please sit down!
- Ow!

2365
01:39:32,245 --> 01:39:33,772
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2366
01:39:33,872 --> 01:39:35,516
We apologize.
We're gonna go to sleep.

2367
01:39:35,699 --> 01:39:36,975
Question. I wanna
ask you a question.

2368
01:39:37,075 --> 01:39:38,431
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2369
01:39:39,036 --> 01:39:40,612
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2370
01:39:40,712 --> 01:39:41,738
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2371
01:39:41,838 --> 01:39:42,947
Sit down. Fasten it.

2372
01:39:43,047 --> 01:39:44,532
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2373
01:39:44,632 --> 01:39:45,624
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2374
01:39:45,724 --> 01:39:46,868
You gotta speak English.

2375
01:39:46,968 --> 01:39:48,912
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2376
01:39:49,012 --> 01:39:50,565
I will help him with his seat belt.

2377
01:39:51,673 --> 01:39:53,788
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2378
01:39:53,888 --> 01:39:55,926
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2379
01:39:58,179 --> 01:39:59,952
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i>

2380
01:40:15,155 --> 01:40:16,480
Jesus Christ!

2381
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:18,008
Fuck!

2382
01:40:19,576 --> 01:40:20,984
Donnie...

2383
01:40:21,084 --> 01:40:24,264
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2384
01:40:24,789 --> 01:40:26,532
I can't untie you.

2385
01:40:26,632 --> 01:40:27,908
The captain tied you up.

2386
01:40:28,008 --> 01:40:29,527
He almost fucking tasered you.

2387
01:40:30,378 --> 01:40:31,525
Why?

2388
01:40:31,754 --> 01:40:32,900
Why?

2389
01:40:34,506 --> 01:40:35,823
He's got a fear of flying.

2390
01:40:37,009 --> 01:40:38,486
Ah!

2391
01:40:40,137 --> 01:40:41,671
He's very nervous
on planes, I'm sorry,

2392
01:40:41,771 --> 01:40:43,745
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2393
01:40:43,891 --> 01:40:46,744
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2394
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:49,010
You were screaming at people.

2395
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:50,470
Oh, fuck off.

2396
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:52,681
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2397
01:40:52,781 --> 01:40:53,807
Oh, Jesus.

2398
01:40:53,907 --> 01:40:55,976
You called the captain the N-word.

2399
01:40:56,076 --> 01:40:57,561
I called the captain the N-word?

2400
01:40:57,661 --> 01:41:00,135
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2401
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,683
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2402
01:41:03,117 --> 01:41:06,346
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2403
01:41:07,246 --> 01:41:08,854
Where are the ludes?

2404
01:41:08,954 --> 01:41:10,016
Where are the ludes?

2405
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:12,492
They're up my ass.
Don't worry about it.

2406
01:41:12,592 --> 01:41:14,202
- I got it.
- Okay.

2407
01:41:14,302 --> 01:41:15,946
Thank God.

2408
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:17,664
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do

2409
01:41:17,764 --> 01:41:18,790
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2410
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:19,882
This is bad.

2411
01:41:19,982 --> 01:41:21,877
Fucking things are against my
chest. I can't breathe.

2412
01:41:21,977 --> 01:41:23,587
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2413
01:41:23,687 --> 01:41:25,472
Okay, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

2414
01:41:26,724 --> 01:41:27,916
Okay. Shh! Shh!

2415
01:41:29,018 --> 01:41:30,051
That's good.

2416
01:41:30,151 --> 01:41:31,845
- Go to sleep.
- Rub it harder, buddy.

2417
01:41:31,945 --> 01:41:33,589
You're all right.

2418
01:41:33,773 --> 01:41:36,171
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2419
01:41:41,906 --> 01:41:43,258
Mr. Belfort,

2420
01:41:43,491 --> 01:41:44,887
you're free to go.

2421
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:48,057
Really?

2422
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:52,072
Whoo!

2423
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:53,282
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2424
01:41:53,382 --> 01:41:55,075
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2425
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:57,244
Okay? Let's make Geneva an
asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2426
01:41:57,344 --> 01:41:58,704
What are you
fucking coming at me for?

2427
01:41:58,804 --> 01:42:00,331
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2428
01:42:00,431 --> 01:42:01,957
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2429
01:42:02,057 --> 01:42:03,092
<i>Hilfe!</i>

2430
01:42:04,261 --> 01:42:06,784
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2431
01:42:07,222 --> 01:42:08,744
Jordan Belfort!

2432
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:09,924
At last.

2433
01:42:10,024 --> 01:42:12,703
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2434
01:42:12,811 --> 01:42:14,750
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2435
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:17,052
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2436
01:42:17,438 --> 01:42:19,056
It's a joke.

2437
01:42:19,156 --> 01:42:21,460
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2438
01:42:21,734 --> 01:42:23,185
You need a bigger couch.
For guests.

2439
01:42:23,285 --> 01:42:25,145
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2440
01:42:25,245 --> 01:42:28,140
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2441
01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:32,933
Uh... Wait. Yes.
Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2442
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:36,522
Swiss custom requires
10 minutes of...

2443
01:42:36,622 --> 01:42:37,619
Blah, blah, blah.

2444
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:39,326
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2445
01:42:39,426 --> 01:42:41,103
before business can be discussed.

2446
01:42:42,546 --> 01:42:43,772
Yeah.

2447
01:42:46,466 --> 01:42:47,613
Of course.

2448
01:42:48,176 --> 01:42:51,075
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2449
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:54,423
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2450
01:42:54,523 --> 01:42:56,747
to cooperate with an FBI

2451
01:42:57,019 --> 01:43:00,214
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2452
01:43:00,731 --> 01:43:02,003
<i>Ca depend.</i>

2453
01:43:02,524 --> 01:43:03,796
<i>Ca depend?</i>

2454
01:43:04,318 --> 01:43:05,419
<i>Oui.</i>

2455
01:43:05,819 --> 01:43:08,593
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2456
01:43:09,281 --> 01:43:11,566
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2457
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:13,560
in the coming months.

2458
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:15,903
Shall I check if tanks are
rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2459
01:43:16,003 --> 01:43:18,148
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2460
01:43:18,665 --> 01:43:21,117
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy.
It's Croix.

2461
01:43:21,217 --> 01:43:23,411
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2462
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:25,246
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

2463
01:43:25,346 --> 01:43:27,274
Yeah, yeah. French
fries, pommes frites.

2464
01:43:28,425 --> 01:43:31,074
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2465
01:43:32,387 --> 01:43:35,089
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,</i>

2466
01:43:35,189 --> 01:43:37,537
<i>is are you going to fuck me over?</i>

2467
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:43,836
<i>I understand
perfectly, you American shit.</i>

2468
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:48,310
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genéve

2469
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:50,513
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2470
01:43:50,613 --> 01:43:52,480
is if the crime being pursued

2471
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:54,764
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2472
01:43:54,864 --> 01:43:59,360
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2473
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:00,528
Hmm.

2474
01:44:00,628 --> 01:44:02,238
From a financial standpoint,

2475
01:44:02,338 --> 01:44:03,732
you are now

2476
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,463
in heaven.

2477
01:44:05,563 --> 01:44:07,519
See, I told you he was
fantastic, right?

2478
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:12,821
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2479
01:44:13,175 --> 01:44:14,652
<i>papier toilette.</i>

2480
01:44:15,678 --> 01:44:17,178
We would wipe our ass with it.

2481
01:44:18,597 --> 01:44:21,215
Unless, of course, it
was an investigation

2482
01:44:21,315 --> 01:44:23,134
into stock fraud,

2483
01:44:23,234 --> 01:44:25,386
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

2484
01:44:25,486 --> 01:44:29,504
Then there would have to
be <i>coopération</i> on your part,

2485
01:44:29,604 --> 01:44:31,213
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2486
01:44:31,694 --> 01:44:34,197
Yes, we would. Mmm-hmm.

2487
01:44:34,297 --> 01:44:36,756
Assuming the account is
under your name.

2488
01:44:38,032 --> 01:44:39,634
If it were

2489
01:44:39,784 --> 01:44:41,181
another name,

2490
01:44:42,286 --> 01:44:44,071
a friend's, camarade...

2491
01:44:44,171 --> 01:44:45,348
Cousin?

2492
01:44:49,836 --> 01:44:51,654
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2493
01:44:52,171 --> 01:44:53,397
Hmm.

2494
01:44:53,756 --> 01:44:56,446
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard</i>

2495
01:44:56,546 --> 01:44:59,002
<i>or did you just say
what I thought you said?</i>

2496
01:44:59,102 --> 01:45:00,905
Yes. Yes.

2497
01:45:01,556 --> 01:45:04,205
<i>He's telling me
to use a fucking rathole.</i>

2498
01:45:04,308 --> 01:45:06,009
<i>But a U.S. rathole would never get</i>

2499
01:45:06,109 --> 01:45:08,303
<i>into Switzerland
with all that money.</i>

2500
01:45:08,403 --> 01:45:12,300
<i>What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.</i>

2501
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:20,941
Jordan.

2502
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:23,902
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2503
01:45:24,002 --> 01:45:25,404
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2504
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,102
Oh, no, not at all.

2505
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:31,251
Jordan, come in.

2506
01:45:31,351 --> 01:45:33,937
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.</i>

2507
01:45:34,504 --> 01:45:37,090
<i>Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.</i>

2508
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:39,652
<i>Money talks and
bullshit takes the bus.</i>

2509
01:45:40,135 --> 01:45:42,156
<i>How do you say
"rathole" in British?</i>

2510
01:45:42,469 --> 01:45:44,962
If you get into any
trouble whatsoever,

2511
01:45:45,062 --> 01:45:47,798
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2512
01:45:47,898 --> 01:45:49,246
That I promise.

2513
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:52,579
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2514
01:45:56,858 --> 01:45:58,756
Sometimes I wonder

2515
01:45:59,027 --> 01:46:02,020
if you let money get the
best of you, my love.

2516
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,297
Among

2517
01:46:03,656 --> 01:46:05,303
other substances.

2518
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,802
Oh.

2519
01:46:09,621 --> 01:46:11,029
It's that obvious, huh?

2520
01:46:11,129 --> 01:46:14,434
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2521
01:46:17,045 --> 01:46:18,988
What can I say? I'm...

2522
01:46:19,756 --> 01:46:21,489
I'm a drug addict.

2523
01:46:21,589 --> 01:46:22,992
I really am.

2524
01:46:23,927 --> 01:46:25,778
Cocaine, pills.

2525
01:46:26,178 --> 01:46:28,701
Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2526
01:46:29,139 --> 01:46:30,882
Now that's the truth.

2527
01:46:30,982 --> 01:46:32,216
I mean...

2528
01:46:32,316 --> 01:46:33,744
I'm a sex addict, too.

2529
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:37,063
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2530
01:46:38,273 --> 01:46:40,683
Jesus, why am I telling
you all this? Why am I...

2531
01:46:40,783 --> 01:46:42,461
I'm sorry.

2532
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:45,430
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2533
01:46:45,697 --> 01:46:48,516
- You are. You are easy to talk to.
- Mmm.

2534
01:46:49,576 --> 01:46:51,027
I suppose it's...

2535
01:46:51,127 --> 01:46:52,600
Just my job, you know.

2536
01:46:53,664 --> 01:46:55,448
All these people dependent on me.

2537
01:46:55,548 --> 01:46:58,398
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2538
01:46:58,585 --> 01:47:00,328
Sometimes I feel like I...

2539
01:47:00,428 --> 01:47:03,653
I've bitten off more
than I can chew, you know.

2540
01:47:03,757 --> 01:47:05,859
You're a man with large appetites.

2541
01:47:06,218 --> 01:47:07,410
Yeah.

2542
01:47:09,012 --> 01:47:11,035
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i>

2543
01:47:11,265 --> 01:47:12,372
Yeah.

2544
01:47:12,472 --> 01:47:13,829
Yeah, I am.

2545
01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:19,252
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2546
01:47:19,773 --> 01:47:21,419
My decision.

2547
01:47:21,816 --> 01:47:23,308
It's just hard to...

2548
01:47:23,408 --> 01:47:27,383
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2549
01:47:27,863 --> 01:47:29,510
You know, to...

2550
01:47:29,781 --> 01:47:32,600
Learn to relax and let go and...

2551
01:47:33,285 --> 01:47:35,387
To release the tension.

2552
01:47:36,329 --> 01:47:37,897
<i>She is hitting on me.</i>

2553
01:47:38,748 --> 01:47:40,270
<i>Holy shit!</i>

2554
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:42,731
Yeah, to release the tension.

2555
01:47:46,548 --> 01:47:48,400
I suppose we, uh...

2556
01:47:48,842 --> 01:47:51,286
We all just need to learn, uh...

2557
01:47:51,803 --> 01:47:55,203
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

2558
01:47:57,017 --> 01:47:59,586
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i>

2559
01:48:05,692 --> 01:48:07,393
Stability, dear.

2560
01:48:07,493 --> 01:48:08,966
Family.

2561
01:48:15,619 --> 01:48:17,766
You take care of my niece, my love.

2562
01:48:17,953 --> 01:48:20,226
I'll take care of
everything over here.

2563
01:48:21,248 --> 01:48:22,349
Deal.

2564
01:48:24,877 --> 01:48:27,550
Come on! There you go.

2565
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:28,947
Whoo!

2566
01:48:29,089 --> 01:48:32,443
<i>We had, literally,
a fuckload of money.</i>

2567
01:48:32,843 --> 01:48:34,945
<i>Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.</i>

2568
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:39,435
<i>So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?</i>

2569
01:48:39,535 --> 01:48:41,467
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2570
01:48:41,567 --> 01:48:44,345
<i>Now Brad, as a
successful drug dealer,</i>

2571
01:48:44,445 --> 01:48:46,639
<i>spent his winters in
the south of France,</i>

2572
01:48:46,739 --> 01:48:48,766
<i>which is where he met
his wife, Chantalle,</i>

2573
01:48:48,866 --> 01:48:51,779
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i>

2574
01:48:51,879 --> 01:48:53,384
<i>born, in of all places,</i>

2575
01:48:53,864 --> 01:48:55,466
<i>Switzerland.</i>

2576
01:48:59,536 --> 01:49:01,309
Well, this is fucked.

2577
01:49:01,705 --> 01:49:03,432
Oh. No shit.

2578
01:49:07,211 --> 01:49:09,899
Like, this will take
her like 50 trips.

2579
01:49:09,999 --> 01:49:11,188
I know.

2580
01:49:14,674 --> 01:49:15,949
Let me ask you something?

2581
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:18,627
What about her family? Right?

2582
01:49:18,727 --> 01:49:21,379
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, fight

2583
01:49:21,479 --> 01:49:23,340
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2584
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,342
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2585
01:49:25,442 --> 01:49:27,344
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2586
01:49:27,444 --> 01:49:29,012
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2587
01:49:29,112 --> 01:49:30,347
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2588
01:49:30,447 --> 01:49:32,891
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2589
01:49:32,991 --> 01:49:35,886
Hey, uh, don't forget
about my money.

2590
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:38,688
I'm sorry, what's that?

2591
01:49:38,788 --> 01:49:40,231
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2592
01:49:40,331 --> 01:49:42,430
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2593
01:49:42,702 --> 01:49:44,945
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2594
01:49:45,045 --> 01:49:47,690
When it gets in, I'll give you
a call, you come pick it up.

2595
01:49:50,209 --> 01:49:51,731
You give me a call?

2596
01:49:53,254 --> 01:49:56,539
When it gets here, I'll give you a
call and you'll come pick it up.

2597
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:58,323
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2598
01:49:58,423 --> 01:49:59,906
Sweetheart,

2599
01:50:00,052 --> 01:50:01,920
you have my money
taped to your tits.

2600
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:04,073
Okay? Technically,
you do work for me.

2601
01:50:07,018 --> 01:50:08,710
Hey, Jordan,
we're gonna need to talk.

2602
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,386
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2603
01:50:10,486 --> 01:50:11,457
I ain't going to him, okay.

2604
01:50:11,557 --> 01:50:12,554
- I'm not a fucking <i>shvartze.</i>
- I got it.

2605
01:50:12,654 --> 01:50:13,931
I don't do fucking
pickups, all right?

2606
01:50:14,031 --> 01:50:15,057
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2607
01:50:15,157 --> 01:50:16,725
We meet someplace
that I fucking say.

2608
01:50:16,825 --> 01:50:18,185
And you tell that
fucking piece of shit,

2609
01:50:18,285 --> 01:50:19,436
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2610
01:50:19,536 --> 01:50:21,814
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2611
01:50:21,914 --> 01:50:23,732
I'll mash that
douchebag's teeth in.

2612
01:50:23,832 --> 01:50:25,567
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2613
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:27,361
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2614
01:50:27,461 --> 01:50:29,738
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2615
01:50:29,838 --> 01:50:31,657
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2616
01:50:31,757 --> 01:50:33,742
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2617
01:50:33,842 --> 01:50:35,035
I put that money in there!

2618
01:50:35,135 --> 01:50:36,662
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2619
01:50:36,762 --> 01:50:39,039
I got five more just like you, bro.

2620
01:50:39,139 --> 01:50:40,833
Keep talking,
you fucking piece of shit!

2621
01:50:40,933 --> 01:50:42,668
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2622
01:50:42,768 --> 01:50:43,760
So fuck you!

2623
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:45,587
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2624
01:50:45,687 --> 01:50:47,740
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2625
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:49,576
You okay? Hey, pal.

2626
01:50:52,102 --> 01:50:54,929
<i>The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.</i>

2627
01:50:55,029 --> 01:50:57,348
<i>Two million in cash
in her carry-on,</i>

2628
01:50:57,448 --> 01:50:58,766
<i>which in the big picture</i>

2629
01:50:58,866 --> 01:51:00,544
<i>was a drop in the Swiss bucket.</i>

2630
01:51:01,612 --> 01:51:02,937
<i>'Cause the following month,</i>

2631
01:51:03,037 --> 01:51:04,896
<i>over the course of six round trips,</i>

2632
01:51:04,996 --> 01:51:06,606
<i>Chantalle's family and friends</i>

2633
01:51:06,706 --> 01:51:09,026
<i>smuggled in over 20 million in cash</i>

2634
01:51:09,126 --> 01:51:10,929
<i>without even a hiccup.</i>

2635
01:51:15,833 --> 01:51:17,784
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2636
01:51:17,884 --> 01:51:19,077
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2637
01:51:19,177 --> 01:51:20,287
<i>And here.</i>

2638
01:51:20,387 --> 01:51:21,580
Welcome.

2639
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:22,748
<i>Welcome.</i>

2640
01:51:22,848 --> 01:51:25,092
- Yeah, like four bags of it.
- Ooh!

2641
01:51:26,302 --> 01:51:28,670
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2642
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:30,297
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2643
01:51:30,397 --> 01:51:31,673
Who cares. You're blonde.

2644
01:51:31,773 --> 01:51:32,825
Oh, stop.

2645
01:51:53,496 --> 01:51:54,654
Shit.

2646
01:51:54,754 --> 01:51:57,938
Just put the fucking car in
park, you dumb fucking idiot!

2647
01:51:59,377 --> 01:52:01,035
I can't close this briefcase.

2648
01:52:01,135 --> 01:52:02,495
One fucking day.

2649
01:52:02,595 --> 01:52:04,538
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2650
01:52:04,638 --> 01:52:06,282
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2651
01:52:06,716 --> 01:52:09,444
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2652
01:52:14,182 --> 01:52:15,716
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2653
01:52:15,816 --> 01:52:17,760
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2654
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:18,852
It's a fucking joke.

2655
01:52:18,952 --> 01:52:20,513
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2656
01:52:20,613 --> 01:52:22,056
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2657
01:52:22,156 --> 01:52:23,974
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2658
01:52:24,074 --> 01:52:26,727
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2659
01:52:26,827 --> 01:52:28,896
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2660
01:52:28,996 --> 01:52:31,357
With smart important
people, unlike you.

2661
01:52:31,457 --> 01:52:33,734
People who don't
sucker-punch people

2662
01:52:33,834 --> 01:52:35,317
when they're scared. Okay?

2663
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:36,777
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2664
01:52:36,877 --> 01:52:37,869
I haven't gotten an
apology yet for that.

2665
01:52:37,969 --> 01:52:38,987
You want an apology, okay.

2666
01:52:39,087 --> 01:52:40,531
I check my fucking
messages every day

2667
01:52:40,631 --> 01:52:41,623
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2668
01:52:41,723 --> 01:52:42,866
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2669
01:52:42,966 --> 01:52:43,992
I got a blinking light,

2670
01:52:44,092 --> 01:52:45,369
because I don't have shit from you.

2671
01:52:45,469 --> 01:52:46,662
You know what,
you got a big fucking mouth, okay?

2672
01:52:46,762 --> 01:52:47,996
I got my wife checking the messages

2673
01:52:48,096 --> 01:52:50,082
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2674
01:52:50,182 --> 01:52:51,375
"Has Brad apologized yet?

2675
01:52:51,475 --> 01:52:53,460
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2676
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:55,087
I don't have jack shit.
You know what?

2677
01:52:55,187 --> 01:52:56,588
That's not how you treat people.

2678
01:52:56,688 --> 01:52:57,713
You got a big fucking
mouth, you know.

2679
01:52:57,813 --> 01:52:59,465
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2680
01:52:59,565 --> 01:53:01,759
You're gonna give me a pass?

2681
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:03,427
Look, it's a figure
of fucking speech.

2682
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:05,471
Oh, my gosh.
The Emperor of Fucksville

2683
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:06,848
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2684
01:53:06,948 --> 01:53:07,940
From Fucksville, huh?

2685
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,892
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2686
01:53:09,992 --> 01:53:11,435
when their Emperor's gone?

2687
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:13,062
Is it mayhem?

2688
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:14,939
Are people looting and raping?

2689
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:17,024
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2690
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:18,526
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2691
01:53:18,626 --> 01:53:19,902
You back the fuck up.

2692
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:21,154
I'll cause the biggest
fucking scene

2693
01:53:21,254 --> 01:53:23,447
that I've ever caused in my life

2694
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:25,283
if you come at me again.

2695
01:53:25,383 --> 01:53:26,951
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2696
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:28,244
I got...

2697
01:53:28,344 --> 01:53:29,829
I don't wanna be out
of line or anything,

2698
01:53:29,929 --> 01:53:32,915
but I think you like,
like me. Like you...

2699
01:53:33,015 --> 01:53:34,458
Like when you come at me...

2700
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:35,626
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2701
01:53:35,726 --> 01:53:37,128
and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2702
01:53:37,228 --> 01:53:38,921
You have like a fucking, like...

2703
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:41,007
Like a twinkle.
You have like a twinkle.

2704
01:53:41,107 --> 01:53:42,550
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2705
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:44,218
Jesus fucking Christ.

2706
01:53:44,318 --> 01:53:46,262
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2707
01:53:46,362 --> 01:53:48,055
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2708
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:49,849
You're just not the
one for me, pal.

2709
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:51,058
You know what I mean? It's not...

2710
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:53,059
- it's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2711
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:55,562
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2712
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:57,022
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2713
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:58,481
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2714
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:00,233
You gotta take this case,

2715
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:01,860
you gotta drive straight home,

2716
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:03,528
need you to open up the briefcase,

2717
01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:05,447
and you take out
every single dollar.

2718
01:54:05,547 --> 01:54:07,490
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2719
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:08,700
And once you have it all

2720
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,577
neatly organized
outside the briefcase,

2721
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:12,954
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2722
01:54:13,054 --> 01:54:15,123
your wife's Latvian
cunt, you understand?

2723
01:54:15,223 --> 01:54:16,875
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2724
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:18,417
Fuck. You motherfucking
piece of shit!

2725
01:54:18,517 --> 01:54:19,627
How about now?

2726
01:54:19,727 --> 01:54:21,136
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2727
01:54:22,806 --> 01:54:24,548
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2728
01:54:24,648 --> 01:54:26,300
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2729
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,295
Stop, or I will blow
you the fuck away!

2730
01:54:29,604 --> 01:54:31,805
Drop the case! Put
your hands in the air!

2731
01:54:31,905 --> 01:54:33,724
Get down.

2732
01:54:33,824 --> 01:54:35,627
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2733
01:54:36,236 --> 01:54:37,758
Motherfucker!

2734
01:54:39,698 --> 01:54:40,845
Motherfucker!

2735
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:53,159
Jordan, do I have a
surprise for you!

2736
01:54:53,259 --> 01:54:54,369
What's that?

2737
01:54:54,469 --> 01:54:55,995
Twenty real Lemmons.

2738
01:54:56,095 --> 01:54:57,247
Retired pharmacist's
client of mine,

2739
01:54:57,347 --> 01:54:58,498
they've been in the
safe for 15 years.

2740
01:54:58,598 --> 01:54:59,999
Are you fucking kidding me?
Lemmons?

2741
01:55:00,099 --> 01:55:01,209
Ha-ha!

2742
01:55:01,309 --> 01:55:03,169
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2743
01:55:03,269 --> 01:55:04,963
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,</i>

2744
01:55:05,063 --> 01:55:08,174
<i>the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.</i>

2745
01:55:08,274 --> 01:55:09,759
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2746
01:55:09,859 --> 01:55:11,302
I thought they were like a myth.

2747
01:55:11,402 --> 01:55:13,263
<i>Three times as powerful
as anything available today.</i>

2748
01:55:13,363 --> 01:55:14,389
Look at these babies.

2749
01:55:14,489 --> 01:55:17,058
<i>Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.</i>

2750
01:55:17,158 --> 01:55:19,227
<i>He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.</i>

2751
01:55:19,327 --> 01:55:21,896
<i>Like a birthday, or
being clap free,</i>

2752
01:55:21,996 --> 01:55:25,017
<i>or our money arriving safely
in Switzerland.</i>

2753
01:55:28,329 --> 01:55:29,612
<i>So that night,</i>

2754
01:55:29,712 --> 01:55:31,531
<i>I cleared my schedule
and I rid my body</i>

2755
01:55:31,631 --> 01:55:34,185
<i>of anything that
could fuck with my high.</i>

2756
01:55:34,793 --> 01:55:36,691
<i>It was celebration time.</i>

2757
01:55:37,171 --> 01:55:38,371
Okay.

2758
01:55:38,471 --> 01:55:39,956
Start off with one,
see how it goes?

2759
01:55:40,056 --> 01:55:41,791
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2760
01:55:41,891 --> 01:55:43,364
Here you go.

2761
01:55:43,969 --> 01:55:45,669
- Salud!
- Cheers.

2762
01:55:45,769 --> 01:55:48,619
<i>Maybe if I pull it
again, it'll go down.</i>

2763
01:55:50,266 --> 01:55:51,550
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

2764
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:52,884
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

2765
01:55:52,984 --> 01:55:54,845
<i>Carl, I think I got it figured out.</i>

2766
01:55:54,945 --> 01:55:58,640
<i>It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.</i>

2767
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:00,043
<i>Okay.</i>

2768
01:56:08,282 --> 01:56:10,180
Do you feel anything?

2769
01:56:12,745 --> 01:56:14,017
No.

2770
01:56:16,624 --> 01:56:18,491
It's been 35 minutes.

2771
01:56:18,591 --> 01:56:19,768
Hmm.

2772
01:56:20,961 --> 01:56:22,412
Maybe we've built up a tolerance

2773
01:56:22,512 --> 01:56:24,611
after all these years, huh?

2774
01:56:26,425 --> 01:56:27,651
Hmm.

2775
01:56:37,645 --> 01:56:39,095
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

2776
01:56:39,195 --> 01:56:42,348
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2777
01:56:42,448 --> 01:56:43,599
They're old.

2778
01:56:43,699 --> 01:56:45,851
You think they lost
their potency, huh?

2779
01:56:45,951 --> 01:56:47,629
Check the bottle!

2780
01:56:50,365 --> 01:56:51,815
January '81.

2781
01:56:51,915 --> 01:56:52,983
They're fucking duds.

2782
01:56:53,083 --> 01:56:54,109
Fuck!

2783
01:56:54,209 --> 01:56:55,277
Let's take, uh...

2784
01:56:55,377 --> 01:56:56,930
Let's take two more each.

2785
01:56:58,790 --> 01:57:01,439
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2786
01:57:05,004 --> 01:57:06,747
What are you two retards doing?

2787
01:57:06,847 --> 01:57:08,115
We're working out, honey.

2788
01:57:08,341 --> 01:57:09,958
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2789
01:57:10,058 --> 01:57:11,050
Okay.

2790
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:13,117
- Okay?
- Okay

2791
01:57:14,514 --> 01:57:16,090
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2792
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:17,299
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2793
01:57:17,399 --> 01:57:18,759
I cannot talk to you on this phone,

2794
01:57:18,859 --> 01:57:19,968
I have to talk to you.

2795
01:57:20,068 --> 01:57:21,553
<i>Get out of here.
What's going on?</i>

2796
01:57:21,653 --> 01:57:24,973
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2797
01:57:25,073 --> 01:57:26,725
and then call me from a pay phone.

2798
01:57:26,825 --> 01:57:28,769
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2799
01:57:28,869 --> 01:57:30,547
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2800
01:57:30,947 --> 01:57:32,314
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2801
01:57:32,414 --> 01:57:33,774
I don't know what the
fuck's going on.

2802
01:57:33,874 --> 01:57:35,893
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2803
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:47,994
<i>The closest pay
phone I could get to</i>

2804
01:57:48,094 --> 01:57:50,443
<i>was at the Brookville Country Club.</i>

2805
01:57:51,007 --> 01:57:52,999
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i>

2806
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:55,744
<i>just a mile down the road
from my house.</i>

2807
01:58:05,104 --> 01:58:06,555
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2808
01:58:06,655 --> 01:58:07,681
I'm at a pay phone.
What's going on?

2809
01:58:07,781 --> 01:58:08,890
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

2810
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:10,767
Please. Your little
friend there, Brad,

2811
01:58:10,867 --> 01:58:12,795
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2812
01:58:13,362 --> 01:58:14,688
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2813
01:58:14,788 --> 01:58:16,231
<i>- What'd he do?
- I don't know what he did.</i>

2814
01:58:16,331 --> 01:58:17,649
My friends in Long Island told me

2815
01:58:17,749 --> 01:58:19,943
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2816
01:58:20,043 --> 01:58:21,035
He got locked up by...

2817
01:58:21,135 --> 01:58:23,363
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2818
01:58:23,463 --> 01:58:24,739
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

2819
01:58:24,839 --> 01:58:26,324
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2820
01:58:26,424 --> 01:58:27,826
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
<i>- Listen to me!</i>

2821
01:58:27,926 --> 01:58:28,897
I gotta go fucking
talk to him right now!

2822
01:58:28,997 --> 01:58:30,912
Listen to me! Don't go!
Listen to me.

2823
01:58:31,012 --> 01:58:33,622
That guy Denham,
that FBI agent guy,

2824
01:58:33,722 --> 01:58:36,000
somebody told me he's got
your phones tapped.

2825
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,585
Your office and your home.

2826
01:58:37,685 --> 01:58:39,378
<i>Don't talk on the
motherfucking phone!</i>

2827
01:58:39,478 --> 01:58:41,452
Okay. Fuck! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

2828
01:58:41,806 --> 01:58:43,032
<i>Jordan.</i>

2829
01:58:43,475 --> 01:58:47,303
You didn't try to bribe this
fucking FBI agent, did you?

2830
01:58:47,403 --> 01:58:49,430
No, I didn't try to
bribe an FBI agent.

2831
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:51,056
You think I'm that fucking stupid?
No.

2832
01:58:51,156 --> 01:58:53,017
<i>What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.</i>

2833
01:58:53,117 --> 01:58:54,268
<i>Say that again.</i>

2834
01:58:54,368 --> 01:58:57,218
I said...

2835
01:58:57,781 --> 01:58:59,198
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i>

2836
01:59:00,283 --> 01:59:01,317
I said...

2837
01:59:01,417 --> 01:59:02,910
<i>Are you fucking high?</i>

2838
01:59:05,455 --> 01:59:08,183
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i>

2839
01:59:08,917 --> 01:59:11,076
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.</i>

2840
01:59:11,176 --> 01:59:12,786
<i>Don't get behind the
wheel of the car.</i>

2841
01:59:12,886 --> 01:59:14,413
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.</i>

2842
01:59:14,513 --> 01:59:15,748
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i>

2843
01:59:15,848 --> 01:59:18,083
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i>

2844
01:59:18,183 --> 01:59:21,128
<i>the Lemmons had developed
a delayed fuse.</i>

2845
01:59:21,228 --> 01:59:23,881
<i>It took 90 minutes for these
little fuckers to kick in.</i>

2846
01:59:23,981 --> 01:59:25,299
<i>But once they did...</i>

2847
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:26,800
<i>Pow!</i>

2848
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,425
<i>I mean, I had skipped
the tingle phase</i>

2849
01:59:28,525 --> 01:59:30,426
<i>and went straight
to the drool phase.</i>

2850
01:59:30,526 --> 01:59:32,470
<i>Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...</i>

2851
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:34,472
<i>These little bastards
were so strong,</i>

2852
01:59:34,572 --> 01:59:36,599
<i>I discovered a whole new phase.</i>

2853
01:59:36,699 --> 01:59:38,798
<i>The cerebral palsy phase.</i>

2854
01:59:40,988 --> 01:59:43,090
<i>Come on, stand up!</i>

2855
01:59:46,952 --> 01:59:48,975
<i>Okay, walking's out.</i>

2856
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:52,809
<i>All right, think, think.
What else is there?</i>

2857
01:59:53,542 --> 01:59:57,363
<i>Yes! I can crawl.
I can crawl like Skylar!</i>

2858
02:00:28,909 --> 02:00:31,979
<i>Fuck! The kid makes it
look so goddamn easy!</i>

2859
02:00:38,919 --> 02:00:41,329
<i>Think, you motherfucker, think!</i>

2860
02:00:41,429 --> 02:00:42,747
<i>Yes!</i>

2861
02:00:42,847 --> 02:00:44,992
<i>I got it! I've got it!</i>

2862
02:00:45,301 --> 02:00:47,574
<i>I can roll! I can roll!</i>

2863
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:36,866
Ah!

2864
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:56,310
Ah!

2865
02:02:09,799 --> 02:02:11,133
Jordan.

2866
02:02:12,635 --> 02:02:14,078
<i>Jordan.</i>

2867
02:02:14,345 --> 02:02:16,046
<i>Oh, Jesus. Where are you?</i>

2868
02:02:16,146 --> 02:02:17,588
I'm at a country club!

2869
02:02:17,688 --> 02:02:18,714
<i>What?</i>

2870
02:02:18,814 --> 02:02:21,634
I'm at a country club!

2871
02:02:21,734 --> 02:02:23,052
<i>I don't know what the
fuck you're saying.</i>

2872
02:02:23,152 --> 02:02:24,387
<i>Look, you need to get home.</i>

2873
02:02:24,487 --> 02:02:27,098
<i>Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line</i>

2874
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:29,058
<i>with some Swiss guy.
I don't know...</i>

2875
02:02:29,158 --> 02:02:30,150
What?

2876
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:33,263
Get him off the phone!

2877
02:02:33,488 --> 02:02:36,273
<i>I can't understand you!</i>

2878
02:02:36,373 --> 02:02:37,608
Get him

2879
02:02:37,708 --> 02:02:38,734
off

2880
02:02:38,834 --> 02:02:39,944
the phone!

2881
02:02:40,044 --> 02:02:41,278
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.</i>

2882
02:02:41,378 --> 02:02:42,747
<i>Can you just get home? Hurry!</i>

2883
02:02:52,507 --> 02:02:54,665
<i>I was less than a mile from home.</i>

2884
02:02:54,765 --> 02:02:57,459
<i>I drove as slow as I fucking could.</i>

2885
02:02:57,559 --> 02:02:59,545
<i>I'd seen Jell-O move faster.</i>

2886
02:02:59,645 --> 02:03:02,100
<i>I was gonna give you 2 million.</i>

2887
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,831
I's gonna be lates.

2888
02:03:05,393 --> 02:03:07,086
You ate 2 million?

2889
02:03:07,896 --> 02:03:09,179
Later.

2890
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:10,389
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

2891
02:03:10,489 --> 02:03:12,024
<i>Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!</i>

2892
02:03:13,318 --> 02:03:15,511
Get out of the way, asshole!

2893
02:03:18,071 --> 02:03:19,355
You hate 2 million?

2894
02:03:19,455 --> 02:03:21,008
No, you don't hate
2 million, Donnie.

2895
02:03:23,452 --> 02:03:26,362
<i>By some miracle,
I made it home alive,</i>

2896
02:03:26,462 --> 02:03:28,811
<i>not a scratch on me or the car.</i>

2897
02:03:38,133 --> 02:03:39,667
Jordan?

2898
02:03:39,767 --> 02:03:42,336
Jesus fucking Christ!

2899
02:03:42,436 --> 02:03:43,921
What did you take?

2900
02:03:44,021 --> 02:03:45,298
What's wrong with you?

2901
02:03:45,398 --> 02:03:46,390
Jor!

2902
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:48,843
It's fucking good, right?

2903
02:03:48,943 --> 02:03:50,269
Fucked up!

2904
02:03:51,563 --> 02:03:53,506
Get off the phone!

2905
02:03:56,443 --> 02:03:58,686
What the fuck, Jordan?

2906
02:03:58,786 --> 02:04:00,354
Your daughter's in the house!

2907
02:04:00,454 --> 02:04:01,522
I hope you know that!

2908
02:04:01,622 --> 02:04:02,899
Your fucking daughter's
in the house!

2909
02:04:02,999 --> 02:04:04,901
Yeah, it's real fucking
funny, Donnie.

2910
02:04:05,001 --> 02:04:07,411
Get off the phone!

2911
02:04:08,539 --> 02:04:09,534
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2912
02:04:09,634 --> 02:04:11,353
The FBI!

2913
02:04:12,583 --> 02:04:13,935
Hey!

2914
02:04:14,377 --> 02:04:16,354
I'm on phone!

2915
02:04:16,462 --> 02:04:18,940
Get off the fucking phone!

2916
02:04:20,591 --> 02:04:22,693
- Come here!
- ...the phone.

2917
02:04:24,679 --> 02:04:27,908
Come on.
We're gonna go upstairs, all right.

2918
02:04:29,767 --> 02:04:30,959
Ow!

2919
02:04:32,687 --> 02:04:34,221
I'm on the phone!

2920
02:04:34,321 --> 02:04:35,639
On the phone!

2921
02:04:35,739 --> 02:04:37,883
I know what you did,

2922
02:04:38,275 --> 02:04:39,725
you piece of shit!

2923
02:04:39,825 --> 02:04:41,519
What? What?

2924
02:04:41,619 --> 02:04:43,013
Brad!

2925
02:04:43,363 --> 02:04:44,563
Huh?

2926
02:04:44,663 --> 02:04:46,182
Brad!

2927
02:04:46,575 --> 02:04:47,817
Brad!

2928
02:04:47,917 --> 02:04:50,391
You fucking cocksucker!

2929
02:04:54,624 --> 02:04:56,534
What did you do,

2930
02:04:56,634 --> 02:04:58,410
you piece of shit?

2931
02:04:58,510 --> 02:04:59,983
Fuck you!

2932
02:05:01,131 --> 02:05:03,457
I wanna fucking kill you!

2933
02:05:03,557 --> 02:05:05,780
I wanna fucking kill you!

2934
02:05:06,635 --> 02:05:08,078
I got you!

2935
02:05:32,536 --> 02:05:34,559
What the fuck happened?

2936
02:05:34,914 --> 02:05:36,197
Oh, shit!

2937
02:05:36,297 --> 02:05:38,208
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2938
02:05:38,308 --> 02:05:39,985
Donnie? Donnie?

2939
02:05:40,210 --> 02:05:41,327
Donnie?

2940
02:05:41,427 --> 02:05:42,745
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2941
02:05:42,845 --> 02:05:44,622
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2942
02:05:44,722 --> 02:05:45,957
Jordan, I don't know
what the fuck to do!

2943
02:05:46,057 --> 02:05:47,655
I can't help him!
Oh, my God. Jordan.

2944
02:05:49,386 --> 02:05:51,963
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2945
02:05:52,063 --> 02:05:53,866
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2946
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:57,329
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2947
02:05:58,145 --> 02:06:00,543
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2948
02:06:00,856 --> 02:06:02,306
<i>Ah!</i>

2949
02:06:02,406 --> 02:06:03,774
I got you.

2950
02:06:20,581 --> 02:06:21,682
Oh!

2951
02:06:23,042 --> 02:06:24,735
Step aside!

2952
02:06:24,877 --> 02:06:26,354
Oh, God!

2953
02:06:26,712 --> 02:06:28,280
Oh, God!

2954
02:06:28,547 --> 02:06:30,399
Move aside, baby.

2955
02:06:37,264 --> 02:06:39,090
Come on! Come on!

2956
02:06:39,190 --> 02:06:40,458
Come on!

2957
02:06:44,897 --> 02:06:47,671
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2958
02:06:48,609 --> 02:06:50,685
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2959
02:06:50,785 --> 02:06:52,509
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2960
02:06:58,076 --> 02:06:59,193
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2961
02:06:59,293 --> 02:07:01,195
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2962
02:07:01,295 --> 02:07:02,446
I don't fucking know!

2963
02:07:02,546 --> 02:07:04,289
Just get over here! Call 911.

2964
02:07:12,298 --> 02:07:13,399
Yeah.

2965
02:07:14,843 --> 02:07:17,287
You all right? He's all right.

2966
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,594
Mr. Belfort?

2967
02:07:33,445 --> 02:07:35,013
Mr. Belfort?

2968
02:07:37,574 --> 02:07:40,526
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck.

2969
02:07:40,626 --> 02:07:43,180
Sir, we need to ask
you some questions.

2970
02:07:43,747 --> 02:07:45,739
Are you fucking kidding me?
Fuck you.

2971
02:07:45,839 --> 02:07:46,907
Come on, get up.

2972
02:07:47,007 --> 02:07:48,651
Get the fuck out of my house.

2973
02:07:50,336 --> 02:07:52,079
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2974
02:07:52,179 --> 02:07:53,664
I been sitting here all night.

2975
02:07:53,764 --> 02:07:55,123
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2976
02:07:55,223 --> 02:07:57,166
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2977
02:07:57,266 --> 02:07:58,334
Where you taking him?

2978
02:07:58,434 --> 02:07:59,426
You ain't got no warrant.

2979
02:07:59,526 --> 02:08:01,110
Just come up in people's
house like that!

2980
02:08:01,972 --> 02:08:04,256
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2981
02:08:04,356 --> 02:08:05,579
Huh?

2982
02:08:05,808 --> 02:08:07,000
Well?

2983
02:08:10,146 --> 02:08:11,668
<i>Wow!</i>

2984
02:08:11,856 --> 02:08:13,754
<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i>

2985
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:31,268
Get out of the fucking way!

2986
02:08:33,127 --> 02:08:34,479
Fuck!

2987
02:08:40,009 --> 02:08:41,960
Did you drive

2988
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:43,738
that car tonight?

2989
02:08:44,764 --> 02:08:46,923
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2990
02:08:47,023 --> 02:08:48,800
I'm a family man!

2991
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:50,634
Family man. Honey!

2992
02:08:50,734 --> 02:08:52,636
<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i>

2993
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:55,765
<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i>

2994
02:08:55,865 --> 02:08:57,516
<i>The cops took me in
for questioning,</i>

2995
02:08:57,616 --> 02:08:58,976
<i>but they couldn't charge me.</i>

2996
02:08:59,076 --> 02:09:01,520
<i>They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.</i>

2997
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:02,646
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

2998
02:09:02,746 --> 02:09:04,815
<i>Brad did three months
in jail for contempt</i>

2999
02:09:04,915 --> 02:09:07,485
<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i>

3000
02:09:07,585 --> 02:09:08,611
<i>The result,</i>

3001
02:09:08,711 --> 02:09:10,321
<i>I was soot-free.</i>

3002
02:09:10,421 --> 02:09:12,782
<i>But I had eyes on me
like never before.</i>

3003
02:09:12,882 --> 02:09:14,492
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

3004
02:09:14,592 --> 02:09:17,495
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

3005
02:09:17,595 --> 02:09:19,163
You know I don't believe
in luck, right?

3006
02:09:19,263 --> 02:09:20,623
But it's time.

3007
02:09:20,723 --> 02:09:22,958
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

3008
02:09:23,058 --> 02:09:24,960
before your luck runs out.

3009
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:26,629
Wave to Daddy.

3010
02:09:26,729 --> 02:09:27,797
Hey.

3011
02:09:27,897 --> 02:09:29,450
Hey, sweetie.

3012
02:09:34,563 --> 02:09:37,848
What kind of terms would you
be talking about if I...

3013
02:09:37,948 --> 02:09:39,183
I don't know.

3014
02:09:39,283 --> 02:09:42,228
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

3015
02:09:42,328 --> 02:09:45,356
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

3016
02:09:45,456 --> 02:09:48,189
Ticky-tack shit like
that, you know.

3017
02:09:48,289 --> 02:09:50,274
You pay a couple million
dollars in fines,

3018
02:09:50,374 --> 02:09:53,349
in exchange, the SEC fucks
off till the end of time.

3019
02:09:55,622 --> 02:09:57,349
And Stratton?

3020
02:09:57,749 --> 02:09:59,659
What happens to Stratton?

3021
02:09:59,759 --> 02:10:02,537
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

3022
02:10:02,637 --> 02:10:03,788
Let Donnie be in charge.

3023
02:10:03,888 --> 02:10:05,532
Right. Donnie.

3024
02:10:06,175 --> 02:10:08,376
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

3025
02:10:08,476 --> 02:10:10,211
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

3026
02:10:10,311 --> 02:10:13,047
However, with you stepping
down voluntarily,

3027
02:10:13,147 --> 02:10:15,091
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

3028
02:10:15,191 --> 02:10:17,586
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

3029
02:10:18,604 --> 02:10:19,887
Jordan.

3030
02:10:19,987 --> 02:10:21,931
What do you have to think about?

3031
02:10:22,031 --> 02:10:23,558
You beat them.

3032
02:10:23,658 --> 02:10:24,809
You won!

3033
02:10:24,909 --> 02:10:26,519
God knows you never
have to work again.

3034
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:28,563
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

3035
02:10:28,663 --> 02:10:29,730
- Is that what you want?
- No.

3036
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:30,898
- Of course not.
- Okay.

3037
02:10:30,998 --> 02:10:33,025
Okay! You got all the
money in the world.

3038
02:10:33,125 --> 02:10:34,694
You need everybody else's money?

3039
02:10:34,794 --> 02:10:36,195
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

3040
02:10:36,295 --> 02:10:38,573
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

3041
02:10:38,673 --> 02:10:40,476
You built it, so now preserve it.

3042
02:11:11,614 --> 02:11:13,091
You know,

3043
02:11:13,407 --> 02:11:16,151
five years ago, when I
started Stratton Oakmont

3044
02:11:16,251 --> 02:11:18,278
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

3045
02:11:18,378 --> 02:11:21,774
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

3046
02:11:23,626 --> 02:11:25,202
And it's truly with a heavy heart

3047
02:11:25,302 --> 02:11:27,526
that I'm here to say that...

3048
02:11:29,006 --> 02:11:31,382
That that day is finally here.

3049
02:11:35,428 --> 02:11:37,755
I wanna...
I want to thank you all for your...

3050
02:11:37,855 --> 02:11:40,506
Your years of loyalty
and admiration.

3051
02:11:40,606 --> 02:11:42,159
But the point is this.

3052
02:11:43,018 --> 02:11:44,302
Under Donnie's leadership,

3053
02:11:44,402 --> 02:11:47,847
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

3054
02:11:47,947 --> 02:11:50,767
moving into key management
positions, this place really

3055
02:11:50,867 --> 02:11:52,143
is gonna be better than ever!

3056
02:11:52,243 --> 02:11:54,467
That I promise you. Okay?

3057
02:11:54,697 --> 02:11:57,300
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

3058
02:12:00,327 --> 02:12:03,071
This is Ellis Island here, people.

3059
02:12:03,171 --> 02:12:04,822
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

3060
02:12:04,922 --> 02:12:07,450
whether your relatives came
over on the fucking Mayflower

3061
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:09,661
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

3062
02:12:09,761 --> 02:12:11,996
this right here is the
land of opportunity.

3063
02:12:12,096 --> 02:12:14,650
Stratton Oakmont is America!

3064
02:12:18,595 --> 02:12:20,296
All of you know
Kimmie Belzer, right?

3065
02:12:20,396 --> 02:12:21,547
Yes, we do.

3066
02:12:21,647 --> 02:12:22,757
Fuck you.

3067
02:12:22,857 --> 02:12:24,676
Come on, Kimmie.

3068
02:12:24,776 --> 02:12:26,261
What you probably didn't know is,

3069
02:12:26,361 --> 02:12:28,179
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

3070
02:12:28,279 --> 02:12:30,583
one of Stratton's original 20.

3071
02:12:31,233 --> 02:12:33,142
Now most of you met Kimmie,

3072
02:12:33,242 --> 02:12:36,296
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

3073
02:12:36,571 --> 02:12:39,800
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

3074
02:12:41,659 --> 02:12:44,353
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

3075
02:12:44,912 --> 02:12:46,780
A woman who spends

3076
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:48,323
her winters in the Bahamas

3077
02:12:48,423 --> 02:12:50,568
and summers in the Hamptons!

3078
02:12:55,465 --> 02:12:57,909
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

3079
02:13:00,636 --> 02:13:04,536
The Kimmie that I met didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

3080
02:13:05,641 --> 02:13:07,926
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

3081
02:13:08,026 --> 02:13:09,845
with an 8-year-old son.

3082
02:13:09,945 --> 02:13:12,998
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

3083
02:13:13,939 --> 02:13:17,684
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

3084
02:13:17,784 --> 02:13:19,936
she asked for a $5,000 advance

3085
02:13:20,036 --> 02:13:23,261
just so she could pay
her son's tuition.

3086
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:29,404
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

3087
02:13:29,504 --> 02:13:31,227
Go on, tell them.

3088
02:13:32,916 --> 02:13:35,064
You wrote me a check

3089
02:13:35,168 --> 02:13:37,396
for $25,000.

3090
02:13:38,588 --> 02:13:40,070
That's right.

3091
02:13:40,170 --> 02:13:41,574
Thank you.

3092
02:13:44,886 --> 02:13:46,738
And you know why that is?

3093
02:13:49,974 --> 02:13:52,418
It's because I believed in you.

3094
02:13:53,978 --> 02:13:56,797
It's because I believed
in you, Kimmie,

3095
02:13:57,148 --> 02:13:58,932
just like I believe in each

3096
02:13:59,032 --> 02:14:01,060
and every one of you here today.

3097
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:03,520
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

3098
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:05,439
I fucking love you! I love you.

3099
02:14:05,539 --> 02:14:08,389
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

3100
02:14:11,162 --> 02:14:13,264
And I love all of you!

3101
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:16,116
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

3102
02:14:16,216 --> 02:14:18,770
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

3103
02:14:19,504 --> 02:14:21,857
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

3104
02:14:28,262 --> 02:14:30,535
It's a shame, you know.

3105
02:14:32,015 --> 02:14:34,050
For years, I've been
telling you guys

3106
02:14:34,150 --> 02:14:36,177
never to take no for
an answer, right?

3107
02:14:36,277 --> 02:14:39,548
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

3108
02:14:40,357 --> 02:14:42,710
until you get what you want.

3109
02:14:43,527 --> 02:14:45,345
Because you all deserve it.

3110
02:14:47,281 --> 02:14:50,601
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

3111
02:14:50,993 --> 02:14:53,152
barring me from the
securities industry,

3112
02:14:53,252 --> 02:14:55,305
barring me from Stratton,

3113
02:14:56,289 --> 02:14:57,811
my home.

3114
02:15:00,501 --> 02:15:02,603
What the fuck is that, you know?

3115
02:15:03,713 --> 02:15:06,157
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

3116
02:15:06,757 --> 02:15:09,656
It's me taking no for an answer,
you know.

3117
02:15:11,053 --> 02:15:12,337
It's them...

3118
02:15:12,437 --> 02:15:15,742
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

3119
02:15:16,392 --> 02:15:19,211
It's me being a hypocrite
is what it is.

3120
02:15:24,274 --> 02:15:25,671
So...

3121
02:15:32,657 --> 02:15:34,350
You know what?

3122
02:15:38,038 --> 02:15:39,705
I'm not leaving.

3123
02:15:41,958 --> 02:15:43,355
I'm not leaving.

3124
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:47,421
I'm not fucking leaving!

3125
02:15:52,427 --> 02:15:54,905
You're not getting
a fucking promotion!

3126
02:15:56,181 --> 02:15:57,658
The show goes on!

3127
02:16:00,143 --> 02:16:01,594
This is my home!

3128
02:16:01,694 --> 02:16:04,430
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

3129
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:06,504
to take me out of here!

3130
02:16:08,401 --> 02:16:10,895
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

3131
02:16:10,995 --> 02:16:12,730
or fucking SWAT team

3132
02:16:12,830 --> 02:16:15,384
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

3133
02:16:18,119 --> 02:16:19,219
Fuck them!

3134
02:16:21,622 --> 02:16:23,520
Fuck them!

3135
02:16:57,489 --> 02:16:59,357
Jordy! Jordy!

3136
02:16:59,457 --> 02:17:01,510
Jordy! Get back here!

3137
02:17:02,286 --> 02:17:03,512
Hey!

3138
02:17:05,872 --> 02:17:07,206
Give me that.

3139
02:17:09,668 --> 02:17:10,785
What is this?

3140
02:17:10,885 --> 02:17:13,439
<i>Ramar of the Jungle,
for Christ sake?</i>

3141
02:17:14,464 --> 02:17:17,415
<i>Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.</i>

3142
02:17:17,515 --> 02:17:20,961
<i>Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.</i>

3143
02:17:21,061 --> 02:17:23,786
<i>He is back in the ocean.
Happy hunting.</i>

3144
02:17:36,569 --> 02:17:38,895
<i>It was our time to party big.</i>

3145
02:17:38,995 --> 02:17:41,674
<i>And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.</i>

3146
02:17:42,408 --> 02:17:44,734
<i>I apologized, even
offered to pay him</i>

3147
02:17:44,834 --> 02:17:46,478
<i>for his time in the can.</i>

3148
02:17:46,996 --> 02:17:49,114
<i>But he said no, that he was out.</i>

3149
02:17:49,214 --> 02:17:51,032
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i>

3150
02:17:51,132 --> 02:17:52,742
<i>Sad thing was,</i>

3151
02:17:52,842 --> 02:17:54,327
<i>two years later</i>

3152
02:17:54,427 --> 02:17:56,132
<i>he was dead.</i>

3153
02:17:56,232 --> 02:17:58,691
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i>

3154
02:17:59,383 --> 02:18:01,793
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i>

3155
02:18:01,893 --> 02:18:05,130
<i>Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...</i>

3156
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:07,579
<i>Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.</i>

3157
02:18:09,644 --> 02:18:10,844
<i>Within days,</i>

3158
02:18:10,943 --> 02:18:13,304
<i>subpoenas started flying.</i>

3159
02:18:13,404 --> 02:18:16,682
<i>Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.</i>

3160
02:18:16,782 --> 02:18:18,809
<i>Donnie couldn't drink
water fast enough.</i>

3161
02:18:18,909 --> 02:18:21,353
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

3162
02:18:21,453 --> 02:18:24,802
Here's what we do with
subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

3163
02:18:30,411 --> 02:18:33,071
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

3164
02:18:33,171 --> 02:18:35,032
Fuck you! Fuck you!

3165
02:18:35,132 --> 02:18:37,686
Fuck you!

3166
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:44,192
Oh!

3167
02:18:44,634 --> 02:18:46,627
Jordan Belfort.

3168
02:18:46,727 --> 02:18:48,712
Alden. That's a nice name.

3169
02:18:48,812 --> 02:18:50,047
Thank you very much for that.

3170
02:18:50,147 --> 02:18:52,341
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

3171
02:18:52,441 --> 02:18:54,051
I do not recall that.

3172
02:18:54,151 --> 02:18:56,511
I do not recall that. Okay?

3173
02:18:56,611 --> 02:18:58,722
Mr. Ming,
thank you for coming in today.

3174
02:18:58,822 --> 02:19:00,432
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

3175
02:19:00,532 --> 02:19:01,725
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

3176
02:19:01,825 --> 02:19:03,518
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i>

3177
02:19:03,618 --> 02:19:05,228
I got a low blood sugar,
thyroid thing.

3178
02:19:05,328 --> 02:19:06,438
<i>It went on for months.</i>

3179
02:19:06,538 --> 02:19:08,564
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i>

3180
02:19:08,664 --> 02:19:10,232
Tell him to proceed
with the questions.

3181
02:19:10,332 --> 02:19:12,735
<i>But not a single
Strattonite cracked.</i>

3182
02:19:12,835 --> 02:19:14,487
Gladys Carrera?

3183
02:19:14,587 --> 02:19:16,113
Doesn't ring a bell.

3184
02:19:16,213 --> 02:19:18,875
Sorry, I have no
recommendation of that.

3185
02:19:18,975 --> 02:19:19,992
No.

3186
02:19:20,092 --> 02:19:21,084
No idea.

3187
02:19:21,184 --> 02:19:23,663
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3188
02:19:23,763 --> 02:19:26,040
Absolutely not.

3189
02:19:26,140 --> 02:19:27,917
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3190
02:19:28,017 --> 02:19:30,252
I just thought you
might remember that.

3191
02:19:30,352 --> 02:19:31,796
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i>

3192
02:19:31,896 --> 02:19:33,631
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3193
02:19:33,731 --> 02:19:35,925
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3194
02:19:36,025 --> 02:19:37,635
It was a long phone call.

3195
02:19:37,735 --> 02:19:39,428
I just wondered
if you have any memory of that.

3196
02:19:39,528 --> 02:19:41,263
Okay. You know we've
talked to several

3197
02:19:41,363 --> 02:19:42,640
of the employees at this firm

3198
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:43,933
and nobody can recall anything

3199
02:19:44,033 --> 02:19:46,060
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3200
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,428
I think it's Odd.

3201
02:19:49,197 --> 02:19:50,439
Do you recall

3202
02:19:50,539 --> 02:19:51,732
Cartage Corporation?

3203
02:19:51,832 --> 02:19:53,150
Mmm.

3204
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:54,485
You do recall it?

3205
02:19:54,585 --> 02:19:55,933
No, I don't recall that at all.

3206
02:19:56,413 --> 02:19:59,437
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3207
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,118
Are you gonna say
anything about that?

3208
02:20:02,218 --> 02:20:03,493
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3209
02:20:03,593 --> 02:20:05,286
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3210
02:20:05,384 --> 02:20:07,078
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3211
02:20:07,178 --> 02:20:09,072
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3212
02:20:11,008 --> 02:20:12,792
Can I get you anything
else, gentlemen?

3213
02:20:12,892 --> 02:20:14,711
Yes. Sweetheart,
I have a rare condition

3214
02:20:14,811 --> 02:20:16,129
which requires me to
drink one of those

3215
02:20:16,229 --> 02:20:18,282
every 15 minutes, please.

3216
02:20:18,682 --> 02:20:21,801
<i>We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.</i>

3217
02:20:21,901 --> 02:20:24,000
<i>So, we took our wives to Italy.</i>

3218
02:20:24,313 --> 02:20:26,723
<i>We figured we were safer
working from overseas</i>

3219
02:20:26,823 --> 02:20:28,182
<i>giving orders to Rugrat.</i>

3220
02:20:28,282 --> 02:20:30,476
<i>Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove</i>

3221
02:20:30,576 --> 02:20:32,520
<i>I was still running
Stratton from a yacht.</i>

3222
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:33,855
Hey, Rugrat.

3223
02:20:33,955 --> 02:20:35,148
- Oh!
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

3224
02:20:35,248 --> 02:20:37,191
You bald-headed eagle,
how you doing?

3225
02:20:37,291 --> 02:20:38,283
<i>Donnie, Donnie, listen!</i>

3226
02:20:38,383 --> 02:20:39,652
We have a problem, okay.

3227
02:20:39,752 --> 02:20:42,989
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3228
02:20:43,089 --> 02:20:45,116
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3229
02:20:45,216 --> 02:20:46,743
<i>- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!</i>

3230
02:20:46,843 --> 02:20:49,328
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3231
02:20:49,428 --> 02:20:50,700
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3232
02:20:51,048 --> 02:20:52,883
Give me that goddamn phone.

3233
02:20:52,983 --> 02:20:54,638
What's going on?

3234
02:20:54,738 --> 02:20:56,836
Jordan, look.
I'm watching the screen

3235
02:20:56,936 --> 02:20:59,671
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3236
02:20:59,771 --> 02:21:01,757
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3237
02:21:01,857 --> 02:21:03,884
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3238
02:21:03,984 --> 02:21:04,976
It's Donnie.
Call me back, all right.

3239
02:21:05,076 --> 02:21:06,060
Donnie, your little friend

3240
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:07,387
is trying to fuck
me, you know that.

3241
02:21:07,487 --> 02:21:09,181
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3242
02:21:09,281 --> 02:21:10,849
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3243
02:21:10,949 --> 02:21:12,377
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3244
02:21:12,777 --> 02:21:14,519
<i>Even though I owned 85%</i>

3245
02:21:14,619 --> 02:21:17,689
<i>of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,</i>

3246
02:21:17,789 --> 02:21:20,025
<i>the shares were in
his fucking name.</i>

3247
02:21:20,125 --> 02:21:22,319
<i>This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds</i>

3248
02:21:22,419 --> 02:21:24,196
<i>and was trying to take advantage.</i>

3249
02:21:24,296 --> 02:21:25,739
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3250
02:21:25,839 --> 02:21:27,574
I want you to get all our clients
on the phone right now

3251
02:21:27,674 --> 02:21:28,992
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3252
02:21:29,092 --> 02:21:30,535
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3253
02:21:30,635 --> 02:21:32,370
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3254
02:21:32,470 --> 02:21:33,914
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3255
02:21:34,014 --> 02:21:36,082
<i>If that little fucking prick thinks
he can fuck with me,</i>

3256
02:21:36,182 --> 02:21:38,752
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3257
02:21:38,852 --> 02:21:40,253
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3258
02:21:40,353 --> 02:21:41,797
<i>Let's just not
jump to conclusions</i>

3259
02:21:41,897 --> 02:21:43,256
<i>before we know what's going on.</i>

3260
02:21:43,356 --> 02:21:44,716
Captain Ted!

3261
02:21:44,816 --> 02:21:45,959
Captain Ted!

3262
02:21:46,352 --> 02:21:48,761
Hang up your phones!
Everybody, hey!

3263
02:21:48,861 --> 02:21:51,711
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3264
02:21:54,693 --> 02:21:57,215
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3265
02:21:57,361 --> 02:21:58,713
I just...

3266
02:21:59,029 --> 02:22:00,381
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3267
02:22:01,448 --> 02:22:03,141
Aunt Emma...

3268
02:22:03,951 --> 02:22:05,348
Just wait.

3269
02:22:05,619 --> 02:22:07,278
I can't...

3270
02:22:07,378 --> 02:22:10,240
What's going on? Why you crying?

3271
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:12,408
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3272
02:22:12,508 --> 02:22:14,869
I just got a call
from my cousin Betty.

3273
02:22:14,969 --> 02:22:16,037
Yeah?

3274
02:22:16,137 --> 02:22:17,906
Aunt Emma is dead.

3275
02:22:19,174 --> 02:22:21,993
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3276
02:22:22,261 --> 02:22:23,487
You're serious?

3277
02:22:24,179 --> 02:22:26,548
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3278
02:22:26,648 --> 02:22:28,091
Oh, fuck!

3279
02:22:28,191 --> 02:22:29,926
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3280
02:22:30,026 --> 02:22:31,344
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i>

3281
02:22:31,444 --> 02:22:33,012
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i>

3282
02:22:33,112 --> 02:22:34,931
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i>

3283
02:22:35,031 --> 02:22:38,393
<i>And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.</i>

3284
02:22:38,493 --> 02:22:40,562
The last time I talked to her
she was fine!

3285
02:22:40,662 --> 02:22:42,772
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3286
02:22:42,872 --> 02:22:45,024
That's so fucking terrible!

3287
02:22:45,124 --> 02:22:46,818
Oh, fuck!

3288
02:22:46,918 --> 02:22:47,944
It is terrible.

3289
02:22:48,044 --> 02:22:50,530
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3290
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:52,364
My condolences to you
and your family.

3291
02:22:52,464 --> 02:22:53,949
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3292
02:22:54,049 --> 02:22:56,076
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3293
02:22:56,176 --> 02:22:57,369
Now where does that leave us

3294
02:22:57,469 --> 02:22:59,037
in regard to her account exactly?

3295
02:22:59,137 --> 02:23:00,622
Does it go into probate or what?

3296
02:23:00,722 --> 02:23:02,291
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3297
02:23:02,391 --> 02:23:04,084
Your aunt, before she died,

3298
02:23:04,184 --> 02:23:07,114
signed a document naming you
as her successor.

3299
02:23:07,305 --> 02:23:08,797
She did?

3300
02:23:08,897 --> 02:23:10,621
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3301
02:23:10,808 --> 02:23:13,081
Well, not as of yet.

3302
02:23:13,269 --> 02:23:15,354
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3303
02:23:17,690 --> 02:23:19,474
I can't seem to hear you.

3304
02:23:19,574 --> 02:23:22,280
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3305
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:25,105
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
<i>- Fast?</i>

3306
02:23:25,205 --> 02:23:27,324
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3307
02:23:28,952 --> 02:23:31,069
Speak English!
Fucking speak English!

3308
02:23:31,169 --> 02:23:32,485
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Quiet, okay?

3309
02:23:32,585 --> 02:23:33,987
Take your suit,
take your dick, okay,

3310
02:23:34,087 --> 02:23:35,780
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3311
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:37,866
Move my ass! Yes!

3312
02:23:37,966 --> 02:23:42,078
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.</i>

3313
02:23:42,178 --> 02:23:44,122
<i>Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger</i>

3314
02:23:44,222 --> 02:23:46,166
<i>who could fake Aunt
Emma's signature.</i>

3315
02:23:46,266 --> 02:23:47,844
You American shit!

3316
02:23:47,944 --> 02:23:49,710
<i>I just had to get
there by tomorrow,</i>

3317
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:51,337
<i>or lose $20 million.</i>

3318
02:23:51,437 --> 02:23:53,206
We're going to Monaco!

3319
02:23:53,682 --> 02:23:56,008
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3320
02:23:56,108 --> 02:23:58,677
We're going to Monaco, so then
we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3321
02:23:58,777 --> 02:24:00,461
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3322
02:24:00,561 --> 02:24:01,722
But I have business in Switzerland.

3323
02:24:01,822 --> 02:24:03,432
I need to go to
Switzerland right now.

3324
02:24:03,532 --> 02:24:05,677
Bottom line. Sorry.

3325
02:24:05,902 --> 02:24:07,754
We gotta get to London.

3326
02:24:08,196 --> 02:24:09,513
Why? Why?

3327
02:24:10,907 --> 02:24:12,149
The funeral!

3328
02:24:12,249 --> 02:24:13,643
Yeah, but babe. Look, look...

3329
02:24:13,994 --> 02:24:16,779
I loved your aunt more than
anyone in the entire world.

3330
02:24:16,879 --> 02:24:18,477
I really did.

3331
02:24:18,873 --> 02:24:21,116
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3332
02:24:21,216 --> 02:24:23,410
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3333
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:24,703
She'll still be dead by the time

3334
02:24:24,803 --> 02:24:25,980
we get to London, okay?

3335
02:24:26,506 --> 02:24:28,290
Captain Ted! Captain
Ted, all right, look.

3336
02:24:28,390 --> 02:24:30,209
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3337
02:24:30,309 --> 02:24:31,301
Monaco, right.

3338
02:24:31,401 --> 02:24:33,253
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3339
02:24:33,353 --> 02:24:34,672
so they don't stamp our passports.

3340
02:24:34,772 --> 02:24:36,590
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3341
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:38,384
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3342
02:24:38,484 --> 02:24:39,927
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3343
02:24:40,027 --> 02:24:41,220
That's the fucking plan.

3344
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:43,680
I just want you to know
that we might run into some chop.

3345
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,932
Chop?
We can fucking handle chop, right?

3346
02:24:46,032 --> 02:24:47,433
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3347
02:24:47,533 --> 02:24:48,851
No, no, no. We're
not going anywhere

3348
02:24:48,951 --> 02:24:50,228
unless he says it's
safe, all right.

3349
02:24:50,328 --> 02:24:51,771
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3350
02:24:51,871 --> 02:24:53,231
You don't know shit about chop.

3351
02:24:53,331 --> 02:24:55,483
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3352
02:24:55,583 --> 02:24:57,902
I'll chop your fucking credit
card in half. How about that?

3353
02:24:58,002 --> 02:24:59,904
Chop is fine. Trust me.
Chop is fine.

3354
02:25:00,004 --> 02:25:01,656
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3355
02:25:01,756 --> 02:25:02,907
Uh...

3356
02:25:03,007 --> 02:25:04,867
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3357
02:25:04,967 --> 02:25:06,077
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3358
02:25:06,177 --> 02:25:07,745
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3359
02:25:07,845 --> 02:25:09,038
It's gonna be safe.

3360
02:25:09,138 --> 02:25:11,249
We'll batten down the hatches

3361
02:25:11,349 --> 02:25:12,709
and secure the deck.

3362
02:25:12,809 --> 02:25:16,253
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3363
02:25:16,353 --> 02:25:17,713
Few broken dishes.

3364
02:25:17,813 --> 02:25:18,964
What's a few broken dishes?

3365
02:25:19,064 --> 02:25:20,340
Does that sound fucking
awesome or what?

3366
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:21,800
No. Not really.

3367
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:23,176
We're gonna have a
fucking good time!

3368
02:25:23,276 --> 02:25:25,012
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3369
02:25:25,112 --> 02:25:26,255
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3370
02:25:31,652 --> 02:25:32,799
Hold On!

3371
02:25:35,865 --> 02:25:38,942
What the fuck is going on out here?

3372
02:25:39,042 --> 02:25:41,610
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3373
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:43,738
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3374
02:25:43,838 --> 02:25:45,948
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i>

3375
02:25:46,048 --> 02:25:48,784
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3376
02:25:48,884 --> 02:25:50,578
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3377
02:25:50,678 --> 02:25:51,829
- We can't!
- Go!

3378
02:25:51,929 --> 02:25:54,498
We'll get broad-sided.
It'll tip over!

3379
02:25:54,598 --> 02:25:56,417
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3380
02:25:56,517 --> 02:25:57,509
I'm a master diver!

3381
02:25:57,609 --> 02:25:58,836
No one's gonna fucking die!

3382
02:25:58,936 --> 02:26:01,547
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3383
02:26:01,647 --> 02:26:02,923
I love you.

3384
02:26:03,023 --> 02:26:04,925
I love you, baby.
Just hold on tight.

3385
02:26:05,025 --> 02:26:06,017
Okay.

3386
02:26:06,117 --> 02:26:07,208
Donnie!

3387
02:26:08,688 --> 02:26:09,972
Hold on, baby!

3388
02:26:10,072 --> 02:26:11,124
Donnie!

3389
02:26:13,026 --> 02:26:14,173
Donnie!

3390
02:26:14,569 --> 02:26:15,978
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3391
02:26:16,078 --> 02:26:17,605
Get the fucking ludes.

3392
02:26:17,705 --> 02:26:18,814
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3393
02:26:18,914 --> 02:26:21,642
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3394
02:26:21,742 --> 02:26:24,612
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3395
02:26:24,712 --> 02:26:26,731
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3396
02:26:26,873 --> 02:26:28,145
What are you saying?

3397
02:26:28,542 --> 02:26:30,110
Fuck!

3398
02:26:30,877 --> 02:26:32,078
Get the ludes!

3399
02:26:32,178 --> 02:26:33,788
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3400
02:26:33,888 --> 02:26:35,122
It's three feet of
water down there!

3401
02:26:35,222 --> 02:26:37,957
I will not die sober!

3402
02:26:38,057 --> 02:26:39,793
Get those fucking ludes!

3403
02:26:39,893 --> 02:26:40,885
Okay!

3404
02:26:40,985 --> 02:26:42,371
- Go!
- Okay

3405
02:26:45,141 --> 02:26:46,925
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3406
02:26:47,025 --> 02:26:48,635
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3407
02:26:48,735 --> 02:26:50,126
He's just warning everybody!

3408
02:27:01,989 --> 02:27:03,841
Jesus Christ!

3409
02:27:05,284 --> 02:27:06,526
Hold on!

3410
02:27:06,626 --> 02:27:08,027
Get away from the window!

3411
02:27:08,127 --> 02:27:09,529
Rogue wave!

3412
02:27:09,629 --> 02:27:10,655
Mayday!

3413
02:27:10,755 --> 02:27:13,324
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

3414
02:27:13,424 --> 02:27:14,977
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3415
02:27:15,294 --> 02:27:16,646
I got 'em!

3416
02:27:17,713 --> 02:27:19,247
Give me one for the nerves!

3417
02:27:19,347 --> 02:27:20,498
We're going down!

3418
02:27:20,598 --> 02:27:22,750
This is a fucking Mayday!

3419
02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:25,029
We require immediate assistance!

3420
02:27:26,597 --> 02:27:28,172
Hold on!

3421
02:27:28,272 --> 02:27:29,324
Watch out!

3422
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:43,759
<i>The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians</i>

3423
02:27:43,946 --> 02:27:47,566
<i>is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,</i>

3424
02:27:47,666 --> 02:27:49,685
<i>then you get to dance.</i>

3425
02:28:06,135 --> 02:28:07,908
<i>Did you see that?</i>

3426
02:28:08,221 --> 02:28:11,245
<i>That was the plane
I sent to come get us.</i>

3427
02:28:12,058 --> 02:28:13,675
<i>I shit you not, it exploded</i>

3428
02:28:13,775 --> 02:28:15,844
<i>when a seagull flew
into the engine.</i>

3429
02:28:15,944 --> 02:28:17,997
<i>Three people killed.</i>

3430
02:28:22,109 --> 02:28:23,935
<i>You want a sign from God?</i>

3431
02:28:24,035 --> 02:28:27,215
<i>Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.</i>

3432
02:28:32,535 --> 02:28:36,238
<i>Do you dream of becoming
financially independent</i>

3433
02:28:36,338 --> 02:28:38,949
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3434
02:28:39,049 --> 02:28:40,910
Would you like to own
a home like this,

3435
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:43,119
but can barely afford
to pay your rent?

3436
02:28:43,219 --> 02:28:44,829
My name is Jordan Belfort,

3437
02:28:44,929 --> 02:28:46,956
and there's no secret
to wealth creation.

3438
02:28:47,056 --> 02:28:48,291
No matter who you are,

3439
02:28:48,391 --> 02:28:49,626
no matter where you came from,

3440
02:28:49,726 --> 02:28:52,170
you too can become
financially independent

3441
02:28:52,270 --> 02:28:54,005
in just a matter of months.

3442
02:28:54,105 --> 02:28:56,257
All you need is a strategy.

3443
02:28:56,357 --> 02:28:57,967
When I was 24 years old,

3444
02:28:58,067 --> 02:29:01,846
I made a decision not just
to survive, but to thrive.

3445
02:29:01,946 --> 02:29:04,390
<i>At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.</i>

3446
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:07,936
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3447
02:29:08,036 --> 02:29:09,145
I certainly believe now.

3448
02:29:09,245 --> 02:29:10,647
Think about it for a second.

3449
02:29:10,747 --> 02:29:12,815
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3450
02:29:12,915 --> 02:29:15,068
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3451
02:29:15,168 --> 02:29:16,736
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3452
02:29:16,836 --> 02:29:18,488
<i>If you want to be
a millionaire someday,</i>

3453
02:29:18,588 --> 02:29:20,573
<i>have some guts. Make a decision.</i>

3454
02:29:20,673 --> 02:29:21,908
Jordan Belfort's
setup worked for me

3455
02:29:22,008 --> 02:29:23,409
because I worked hard for it.

3456
02:29:23,509 --> 02:29:24,952
And if it doesn't work for you,

3457
02:29:25,052 --> 02:29:26,044
it's because you're lazy.

3458
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,329
And you should get a
job at McDonald's.

3459
02:29:27,429 --> 02:29:30,290
<i>There's nobody holding
you back from financial freedom.</i>

3460
02:29:30,390 --> 02:29:33,252
And there's nobody stopping
you from making millions.

3461
02:29:33,352 --> 02:29:34,586
Don't just sit at home,

3462
02:29:34,686 --> 02:29:37,365
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3463
02:29:40,059 --> 02:29:41,969
I changed all these people's lives

3464
02:29:42,069 --> 02:29:43,679
and I can change yours, too!

3465
02:29:43,779 --> 02:29:45,013
So come to my seminar!

3466
02:29:45,113 --> 02:29:46,515
The life of your dreams is only...

3467
02:29:46,615 --> 02:29:48,308
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3468
02:29:48,408 --> 02:29:49,434
You're under arrest!

3469
02:29:49,534 --> 02:29:51,178
You gotta be joking!

3470
02:29:52,363 --> 02:29:53,605
You're kidding me.

3471
02:29:53,705 --> 02:29:55,274
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3472
02:29:55,374 --> 02:29:56,608
Turn that camera off.

3473
02:29:56,708 --> 02:29:58,694
I'm fucking shooting a
fucking infomercial here,

3474
02:29:58,794 --> 02:30:00,195
you fucking cocksucker!

3475
02:30:00,295 --> 02:30:01,947
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3476
02:30:02,047 --> 02:30:03,824
You don't got shit
on me, you hear me!

3477
02:30:03,924 --> 02:30:04,950
Go fuck yourself!

3478
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:07,411
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3479
02:30:07,511 --> 02:30:08,537
Hey, Jordan,

3480
02:30:08,637 --> 02:30:10,497
let me give you a
little legal advice.

3481
02:30:10,597 --> 02:30:11,999
Shut the fuck up!

3482
02:30:12,099 --> 02:30:13,583
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3483
02:30:13,683 --> 02:30:16,328
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3484
02:30:18,014 --> 02:30:19,506
<i>I clean up my act.</i>

3485
02:30:19,606 --> 02:30:22,133
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i>

3486
02:30:22,233 --> 02:30:24,967
<i>I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!</i>

3487
02:30:25,067 --> 02:30:27,261
<i>Rugrat goes and gets busted
down in Miami.</i>

3488
02:30:27,361 --> 02:30:28,595
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3489
02:30:28,695 --> 02:30:30,389
<i>And guess who
the fuck with? Saurel.</i>

3490
02:30:30,489 --> 02:30:31,515
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3491
02:30:31,615 --> 02:30:33,851
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3492
02:30:33,951 --> 02:30:35,644
<i>I mean, what are
the fucking odds?</i>

3493
02:30:35,744 --> 02:30:38,397
<i>There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i>

3494
02:30:38,497 --> 02:30:40,065
<i>and Rugrat gets the
one dumb enough</i>

3495
02:30:40,165 --> 02:30:42,234
<i>to get himself arrested
on U. S. soil.</i>

3496
02:30:42,334 --> 02:30:43,724
I know.

3497
02:30:43,824 --> 02:30:45,264
I'm so sorry.

3498
02:30:47,374 --> 02:30:48,615
<i>Even more fucked</i>

3499
02:30:48,715 --> 02:30:50,075
<i>- was that he got busted</i>

3500
02:30:50,175 --> 02:30:51,827
<i>for shit that had
nothing to do with me.</i>

3501
02:30:51,927 --> 02:30:53,495
<i>It had nothing to
fucking do with me.</i>

3502
02:30:53,595 --> 02:30:55,581
<i>Something about
laundering drug money</i>

3503
02:30:55,681 --> 02:30:58,751
<i>through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i>

3504
02:30:58,851 --> 02:31:00,919
<i>you know, the founder of Benihana.</i>

3505
02:31:01,019 --> 02:31:02,379
<i>Benihana.</i>

3506
02:31:02,479 --> 02:31:04,203
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3507
02:31:04,516 --> 02:31:06,300
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3508
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:07,392
<i>Why?</i>

3509
02:31:07,492 --> 02:31:08,802
<i>Why, why, God?</i>

3510
02:31:08,902 --> 02:31:10,387
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i>

3511
02:31:10,487 --> 02:31:13,015
<i>as to choose a chain
of fucking hibachi restaurants</i>

3512
02:31:13,115 --> 02:31:14,418
<i>to take me down?</i>

3513
02:31:16,735 --> 02:31:19,270
<i>Long story short.
Saurel rats me out.</i>

3514
02:31:19,370 --> 02:31:22,440
<i>But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i>

3515
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:24,108
<i>who, it turns out,
he'd been fucking</i>

3516
02:31:24,208 --> 02:31:26,728
<i>every time she went to Switzerland!</i>

3517
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:31,229
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3518
02:31:33,335 --> 02:31:35,119
- All right!
- Ah!

3519
02:31:35,219 --> 02:31:36,954
<i>One count engaging in conspiracy</i>

3520
02:31:37,054 --> 02:31:38,706
<i>to commit securities fraud.</i>

3521
02:31:38,806 --> 02:31:41,000
<i>Two counts securities fraud.</i>

3522
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:44,545
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3523
02:31:44,645 --> 02:31:46,881
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3524
02:31:46,981 --> 02:31:49,455
One count obstruction of justice.

3525
02:31:50,352 --> 02:31:52,671
Bail is set at $10 million.

3526
02:32:07,827 --> 02:32:09,395
<i>Uncle Donnie's here!</i>

3527
02:32:10,204 --> 02:32:12,522
Rocky. How you doing?

3528
02:32:13,123 --> 02:32:15,449
Woof. I hate that fucking dog.

3529
02:32:15,549 --> 02:32:17,827
Yeah, he's getting
old and decrepit.

3530
02:32:17,927 --> 02:32:19,412
Starting to shit in
the house again.

3531
02:32:19,512 --> 02:32:21,205
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3532
02:32:21,305 --> 02:32:22,581
Ah, fuck.

3533
02:32:22,681 --> 02:32:24,333
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3534
02:32:24,433 --> 02:32:25,584
Good to see you.

3535
02:32:25,684 --> 02:32:28,284
Sit down. Oh, man.

3536
02:32:30,056 --> 02:32:31,408
How you doing, brother?

3537
02:32:32,142 --> 02:32:33,676
You know.

3538
02:32:33,776 --> 02:32:35,428
Shitty, pal.

3539
02:32:35,528 --> 02:32:37,707
But I'm hanging in there.

3540
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:41,517
My new piece of jewelry.
Check that out.

3541
02:32:41,617 --> 02:32:43,978
Can't leave the house, you know?

3542
02:32:44,078 --> 02:32:46,678
Starting to get cabin
fever already.

3543
02:32:47,157 --> 02:32:48,850
Fucking Rugrat.

3544
02:32:49,284 --> 02:32:50,651
That wig-wearing faggot.

3545
02:32:50,751 --> 02:32:52,862
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3546
02:32:52,962 --> 02:32:55,531
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3547
02:32:55,631 --> 02:32:57,917
Irresponsible little prick.

3548
02:32:59,044 --> 02:33:00,191
I'll tell you one thing.

3549
02:33:01,421 --> 02:33:04,024
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3550
02:33:04,758 --> 02:33:07,031
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3551
02:33:08,344 --> 02:33:10,037
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3552
02:33:10,721 --> 02:33:12,046
That's her in the house there.

3553
02:33:12,146 --> 02:33:14,165
You could say hi, but she
probably won't wave back.

3554
02:33:14,266 --> 02:33:16,039
Naomi, sweetheart!

3555
02:33:19,396 --> 02:33:20,680
What's up her ass?

3556
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:22,265
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3557
02:33:22,365 --> 02:33:23,850
We probably have to
mortgage the house

3558
02:33:23,950 --> 02:33:25,727
in order to make bail.

3559
02:33:25,827 --> 02:33:27,228
Probably end up selling the thing

3560
02:33:27,328 --> 02:33:29,481
in order to pay for
all the lawyers.

3561
02:33:29,581 --> 02:33:32,101
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3562
02:33:32,284 --> 02:33:34,057
What are you gonna do, right?

3563
02:33:34,787 --> 02:33:37,614
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3564
02:33:37,714 --> 02:33:38,781
How's morale?

3565
02:33:38,881 --> 02:33:41,534
They all pissed off 'cause they
have to make money legally now?

3566
02:33:41,634 --> 02:33:43,107
- Jordan.
- Hmm?

3567
02:33:43,379 --> 02:33:45,872
I got the founding
partners together.

3568
02:33:45,972 --> 02:33:48,401
I talked to them about everything.

3569
02:33:49,051 --> 02:33:50,198
And I got you.

3570
02:33:50,926 --> 02:33:52,573
What do you mean, you got me?

3571
02:33:53,637 --> 02:33:56,456
The house, money, don't
worry about it. I got you.

3572
02:34:02,354 --> 02:34:03,471
All right.

3573
02:34:03,571 --> 02:34:04,562
I love you, buddy.

3574
02:34:04,662 --> 02:34:06,556
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3575
02:34:06,656 --> 02:34:08,675
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3576
02:34:09,527 --> 02:34:10,727
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3577
02:34:10,827 --> 02:34:11,987
All right, enough, enough.

3578
02:34:13,990 --> 02:34:15,190
You want a beer, pal?

3579
02:34:15,290 --> 02:34:16,483
What are you drinking?

3580
02:34:16,583 --> 02:34:18,652
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3581
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:19,945
What's that?

3582
02:34:20,045 --> 02:34:23,073
A non-alcoholic beer.
It's got no alcohol.

3583
02:34:23,173 --> 02:34:25,477
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3584
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:27,244
But if you drink enough,

3585
02:34:27,344 --> 02:34:29,246
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3586
02:34:29,346 --> 02:34:31,414
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3587
02:34:31,514 --> 02:34:32,541
I'm not a scientist.

3588
02:34:32,641 --> 02:34:33,792
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3589
02:34:33,892 --> 02:34:35,460
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3590
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:37,712
I know, but I don't drink.
You remember?

3591
02:34:37,812 --> 02:34:38,964
I don't drink anymore.

3592
02:34:39,064 --> 02:34:40,056
Oh, you wanna go inside

3593
02:34:40,156 --> 02:34:41,550
and blow some lines
of baking powder?

3594
02:34:41,650 --> 02:34:43,468
Or baking soda...

3595
02:34:43,568 --> 02:34:45,845
Can't imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up.

3596
02:34:45,945 --> 02:34:47,389
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3597
02:34:47,489 --> 02:34:48,974
How's being sober?

3598
02:34:49,074 --> 02:34:50,934
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3599
02:34:51,034 --> 02:34:53,463
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3600
02:34:53,904 --> 02:34:56,481
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3601
02:34:56,581 --> 02:34:58,024
unless circumstances dictate,

3602
02:34:58,124 --> 02:35:00,110
and I think they do
dictate in this case,

3603
02:35:00,210 --> 02:35:01,610
and the term is "Grenada."

3604
02:35:01,710 --> 02:35:03,195
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3605
02:35:03,295 --> 02:35:04,363
No. No, I haven't.

3606
02:35:04,463 --> 02:35:05,990
Grenada's very interesting because

3607
02:35:06,090 --> 02:35:07,992
it is a small island nation

3608
02:35:08,092 --> 02:35:11,620
that was invaded by the United
States of America in 1983.

3609
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:13,789
It's about 90,000 people.

3610
02:35:13,889 --> 02:35:16,159
And essentially, it means

3611
02:35:16,843 --> 02:35:18,836
this case is unloseable.

3612
02:35:18,936 --> 02:35:20,004
Okay?

3613
02:35:20,104 --> 02:35:21,672
So, you know, we can come in,

3614
02:35:21,772 --> 02:35:23,632
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3615
02:35:23,732 --> 02:35:24,842
Nobody gives a fuck.

3616
02:35:24,942 --> 02:35:26,565
I'm gonna win.

3617
02:35:26,665 --> 02:35:28,122
You, sir.

3618
02:35:29,564 --> 02:35:31,382
Are what's known

3619
02:35:32,317 --> 02:35:33,517
as a Grenada.

3620
02:35:33,617 --> 02:35:34,758
Hmm.

3621
02:35:36,611 --> 02:35:39,021
You're looking at real prison time.

3622
02:35:39,121 --> 02:35:40,113
Hmm.

3623
02:35:40,213 --> 02:35:42,554
Money laundering can get you
as much as 20 years.

3624
02:35:43,451 --> 02:35:46,194
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3625
02:35:46,294 --> 02:35:47,946
shoving cash in your mattress.

3626
02:35:48,046 --> 02:35:49,144
Is that right?

3627
02:35:49,916 --> 02:35:52,439
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3628
02:35:53,044 --> 02:35:56,871
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3629
02:35:56,971 --> 02:35:58,695
that's not our ambition here.

3630
02:35:59,966 --> 02:36:02,543
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3631
02:36:02,643 --> 02:36:05,868
We think they need to
see their day in court as well.

3632
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:10,384
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3633
02:36:10,484 --> 02:36:13,209
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3634
02:36:14,314 --> 02:36:17,141
Full cooperation. He provides
us with a comprehensive list

3635
02:36:17,241 --> 02:36:19,560
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3636
02:36:19,660 --> 02:36:21,646
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3637
02:36:21,746 --> 02:36:22,980
Wait...

3638
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:24,815
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3639
02:36:24,915 --> 02:36:26,150
A wire. Mmm-hmm.

3640
02:36:26,250 --> 02:36:27,568
What does that mean?

3641
02:36:27,668 --> 02:36:29,528
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3642
02:36:29,628 --> 02:36:30,905
No, I want you to cooperate.

3643
02:36:31,005 --> 02:36:32,907
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3644
02:36:33,007 --> 02:36:36,483
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3645
02:36:40,882 --> 02:36:42,750
How was Cristy's party?

3646
02:36:42,850 --> 02:36:43,918
Fine.

3647
02:36:44,018 --> 02:36:45,412
Good.

3648
02:36:46,471 --> 02:36:48,964
Babe, I spoke to the
lawyers again today.

3649
02:36:49,064 --> 02:36:51,717
I have some really,
really great news.

3650
02:36:51,817 --> 02:36:53,210
Mmm-hmm.

3651
02:36:53,519 --> 02:36:56,213
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3652
02:36:57,064 --> 02:36:58,765
I know that already.

3653
02:36:58,865 --> 02:37:00,213
Right. Exactly.

3654
02:37:00,526 --> 02:37:03,846
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3655
02:37:04,572 --> 02:37:06,891
It turns out, all the FBI really

3656
02:37:07,450 --> 02:37:09,427
wants from me is to, uh,

3657
02:37:09,618 --> 02:37:11,220
to cooperate.

3658
02:37:11,328 --> 02:37:12,612
You know?

3659
02:37:12,712 --> 02:37:13,988
Turns out I have so
much information

3660
02:37:14,088 --> 02:37:15,657
about the stock market
and Wall Street,

3661
02:37:15,757 --> 02:37:16,866
I could save the government

3662
02:37:16,966 --> 02:37:18,866
years of heartache, not to mention

3663
02:37:18,966 --> 02:37:21,395
- countless dollars.
- Mmm-hmm.

3664
02:37:21,712 --> 02:37:24,156
But it gets even better, babe.

3665
02:37:24,506 --> 02:37:27,155
Because if I do
decide to cooperate,

3666
02:37:27,468 --> 02:37:30,294
I might only be
looking at four short years,

3667
02:37:30,394 --> 02:37:31,879
in which case, you know,

3668
02:37:31,979 --> 02:37:34,966
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3669
02:37:35,066 --> 02:37:36,718
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3670
02:37:36,818 --> 02:37:38,594
wouldn't be due till
after I serve my term,

3671
02:37:38,694 --> 02:37:40,972
so we'd still have plenty of
money left over, you know?

3672
02:37:41,072 --> 02:37:42,545
Mmm-hmm.

3673
02:37:43,567 --> 02:37:46,018
The only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit

3674
02:37:46,118 --> 02:37:48,422
is this whole idea of having to

3675
02:37:48,946 --> 02:37:51,148
give information about my friends.

3676
02:37:51,248 --> 02:37:54,484
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3677
02:37:54,584 --> 02:37:56,486
Right. Right. Exactly.

3678
02:37:56,586 --> 02:37:58,155
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3679
02:37:58,255 --> 02:37:59,948
Because they said eventually...

3680
02:38:00,048 --> 02:38:02,909
Eventually everyone's gonna have to
give information on this case.

3681
02:38:03,009 --> 02:38:05,787
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3682
02:38:05,887 --> 02:38:07,998
Well, that's good news. Right?

3683
02:38:08,098 --> 02:38:09,833
Yeah, yeah.

3684
02:38:09,933 --> 02:38:11,657
I'm really happy for you.

3685
02:38:12,970 --> 02:38:16,324
What do you mean, happy for me,
sweetheart?

3686
02:38:17,141 --> 02:38:19,760
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3687
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:21,834
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3688
02:38:23,856 --> 02:38:25,549
Come here, baby.

3689
02:38:25,983 --> 02:38:27,517
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3690
02:38:27,617 --> 02:38:28,643
Jordan...

3691
02:38:28,743 --> 02:38:29,895
Oh, come on, baby.

3692
02:38:29,995 --> 02:38:32,189
I haven't made love to
you in so long. Please.

3693
02:38:32,289 --> 02:38:34,691
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3694
02:38:34,791 --> 02:38:36,310
No! Jordan, stop it!

3695
02:38:37,912 --> 02:38:40,231
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3696
02:38:44,043 --> 02:38:46,019
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3697
02:38:46,503 --> 02:38:49,152
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3698
02:38:49,923 --> 02:38:51,946
You know how much I
love you, right?

3699
02:38:52,342 --> 02:38:54,615
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3700
02:38:59,766 --> 02:39:01,867
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3701
02:39:03,561 --> 02:39:05,379
You wanna fuck me?

3702
02:39:06,272 --> 02:39:07,388
Good.

3703
02:39:07,488 --> 02:39:08,882
Go ahead.

3704
02:39:09,275 --> 02:39:11,343
Go ahead and fuck me.

3705
02:39:12,278 --> 02:39:14,771
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3706
02:39:14,871 --> 02:39:17,565
I want you to fuck me
like it's the last fucking time.

3707
02:39:17,665 --> 02:39:18,942
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3708
02:39:19,042 --> 02:39:20,034
Please hold still.

3709
02:39:20,134 --> 02:39:21,653
'Cause I want you to
come for me, baby.

3710
02:39:21,753 --> 02:39:23,071
Come on, babe.

3711
02:39:23,171 --> 02:39:24,614
Come for me, baby.

3712
02:39:24,714 --> 02:39:25,907
I want you to come for me

3713
02:39:26,007 --> 02:39:27,492
like it's the last fucking time.

3714
02:39:27,592 --> 02:39:29,035
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3715
02:39:29,135 --> 02:39:31,704
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3716
02:39:31,804 --> 02:39:32,914
Come on, baby.

3717
02:39:33,014 --> 02:39:34,290
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3718
02:39:34,390 --> 02:39:36,334
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3719
02:39:36,434 --> 02:39:37,657
Yeah.

3720
02:39:38,387 --> 02:39:40,380
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3721
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:42,874
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3722
02:39:44,601 --> 02:39:46,343
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3723
02:39:46,443 --> 02:39:48,997
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3724
02:39:50,189 --> 02:39:52,633
Oh, God.

3725
02:39:53,192 --> 02:39:54,685
Oh, God.

3726
02:39:54,785 --> 02:39:56,088
Jesus.

3727
02:39:59,616 --> 02:40:00,941
Oh, baby.

3728
02:40:01,041 --> 02:40:03,569
That was so fucking great!

3729
02:40:03,669 --> 02:40:04,972
Oh, God!

3730
02:40:07,248 --> 02:40:09,271
That was the last time.

3731
02:40:09,667 --> 02:40:11,660
What do you mean, baby?

3732
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:14,781
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3733
02:40:15,673 --> 02:40:17,867
What are you talking about?

3734
02:40:19,761 --> 02:40:21,488
I want a divorce.

3735
02:40:23,014 --> 02:40:25,007
What do you mean,
you want a divorce?

3736
02:40:25,107 --> 02:40:27,134
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3737
02:40:27,234 --> 02:40:29,208
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3738
02:40:29,437 --> 02:40:30,721
You just made love to me.

3739
02:40:30,821 --> 02:40:31,889
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3740
02:40:31,989 --> 02:40:34,384
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3741
02:40:35,526 --> 02:40:37,627
Oh, you don't love me?

3742
02:40:37,903 --> 02:40:39,562
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3743
02:40:39,662 --> 02:40:41,856
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3744
02:40:41,956 --> 02:40:43,814
Now that I'm under
federal indictment,

3745
02:40:43,914 --> 02:40:45,816
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3746
02:40:45,916 --> 02:40:47,651
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3747
02:40:47,751 --> 02:40:49,520
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3748
02:40:49,788 --> 02:40:52,072
What kind of person are you?
Tell me.

3749
02:40:52,172 --> 02:40:53,407
You married me!

3750
02:40:53,507 --> 02:40:54,992
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3751
02:40:55,092 --> 02:40:56,744
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3752
02:40:56,844 --> 02:40:58,996
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3753
02:40:59,096 --> 02:41:01,081
If you agree to the
divorce right now,

3754
02:41:01,181 --> 02:41:02,666
I will allow visitation.

3755
02:41:02,766 --> 02:41:04,585
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3756
02:41:04,685 --> 02:41:06,086
It'll save us both a lot of money

3757
02:41:06,186 --> 02:41:08,865
and I got a feeling
you're gonna need it.

3758
02:41:10,350 --> 02:41:13,594
You're not taking my kids,
sweetheart. You hear me?

3759
02:41:13,694 --> 02:41:15,095
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3760
02:41:15,195 --> 02:41:16,347
He said even if you
don't get convicted,

3761
02:41:16,447 --> 02:41:17,598
I've got a good chance
of getting them.

3762
02:41:17,698 --> 02:41:18,766
I got news for you.

3763
02:41:18,866 --> 02:41:20,517
You're not fucking
taking my children,

3764
02:41:20,617 --> 02:41:22,341
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3765
02:41:22,737 --> 02:41:24,772
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3766
02:41:24,872 --> 02:41:27,024
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3767
02:41:27,124 --> 02:41:28,518
You hear me? Fuck you!

3768
02:41:28,660 --> 02:41:31,513
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3769
02:41:40,004 --> 02:41:41,838
Fucking bitch!

3770
02:41:44,258 --> 02:41:45,675
Fucking whore!

3771
02:41:49,972 --> 02:41:52,791
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3772
02:42:01,817 --> 02:42:04,644
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3773
02:42:04,744 --> 02:42:05,895
You're sick!

3774
02:42:05,995 --> 02:42:07,146
You're a sick man!

3775
02:42:07,246 --> 02:42:09,232
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3776
02:42:09,332 --> 02:42:11,818
You think I would let
my kids near you?

3777
02:42:11,918 --> 02:42:13,069
Look at yourself!

3778
02:42:13,169 --> 02:42:14,612
You know what my lawyer said?

3779
02:42:14,712 --> 02:42:18,199
My lawyer said that you're going to
prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3780
02:42:18,299 --> 02:42:21,536
Twenty fucking years! You're
never gonna see the kids again!

3781
02:42:21,636 --> 02:42:22,787
You don't think I'm
not gonna see my...

3782
02:42:22,887 --> 02:42:24,664
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3783
02:42:24,764 --> 02:42:26,915
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3784
02:42:27,015 --> 02:42:28,568
Don't you fucking touch them!

3785
02:42:29,801 --> 02:42:31,744
Don't you fucking touch me!

3786
02:42:33,305 --> 02:42:36,590
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3787
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:38,743
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3788
02:42:41,396 --> 02:42:43,681
Don't you fucking touch her,
Jordan.

3789
02:42:43,781 --> 02:42:46,585
I swear to God,
I will fucking kill you!

3790
02:42:49,154 --> 02:42:50,438
It's all right, baby.

3791
02:42:50,538 --> 02:42:51,772
You and Daddy are gonna go

3792
02:42:51,872 --> 02:42:53,232
on a little trip together, okay?

3793
02:42:53,332 --> 02:42:54,859
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3794
02:42:54,959 --> 02:42:56,027
Violet!

3795
02:42:56,127 --> 02:42:58,279
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3796
02:42:58,379 --> 02:42:59,989
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3797
02:43:00,089 --> 02:43:02,908
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3798
02:43:03,008 --> 02:43:04,285
There you go. Get your legs in.

3799
02:43:04,385 --> 02:43:06,037
I'm taking her with me!

3800
02:43:06,137 --> 02:43:07,329
I told you I'm taking her with me,

3801
02:43:07,429 --> 02:43:08,748
you fucking bitch!

3802
02:43:08,848 --> 02:43:11,618
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3803
02:43:12,302 --> 02:43:14,450
We're going on a
little trip, honey.

3804
02:43:14,805 --> 02:43:16,407
No! No!

3805
02:43:16,890 --> 02:43:18,299
Get the hell out of here!

3806
02:43:18,399 --> 02:43:20,551
Leave that baby alone!

3807
02:43:20,651 --> 02:43:22,803
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3808
02:43:22,903 --> 02:43:24,013
Mommy!

3809
02:43:24,113 --> 02:43:26,306
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3810
02:43:26,406 --> 02:43:27,959
Mommy!

3811
02:43:31,362 --> 02:43:33,089
No!

3812
02:43:40,287 --> 02:43:43,073
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3813
02:43:43,173 --> 02:43:44,449
Get the baby!

3814
02:43:44,549 --> 02:43:46,728
Naomi, get the baby!

3815
02:43:47,378 --> 02:43:49,037
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3816
02:43:49,137 --> 02:43:50,413
It's gonna be okay.

3817
02:43:50,513 --> 02:43:52,566
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3818
02:43:53,467 --> 02:43:55,293
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3819
02:43:55,393 --> 02:43:56,961
She all right?

3820
02:43:57,061 --> 02:43:58,364
Is she all right?

3821
02:43:59,056 --> 02:44:00,703
What's the matter with you?

3822
02:44:00,891 --> 02:44:02,334
Is she all right?

3823
02:44:09,567 --> 02:44:11,015
<i>Paragraph 1.</i>

3824
02:44:11,115 --> 02:44:12,600

Breathe normally.

<i>Including wearing

3835
02:44:29,299 --> 02:44:30,951

3839
02:44:36,129 --> 02:44:37,374
Quit your bitching.

3840

Paragraph 4.
The defendant must not commit,

3842
02:44:41,645 --> 02:44:45,132
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

3843
02:44:45,232 --> 02:44:46,660
Thank you.

3844
02:44:49,478 --> 02:44:50,720
Just here?

3845
02:44:50,820 --> 02:44:52,373
That'd be good.

3846
02:44:54,025 --> 02:44:55,183
Thank you.

3847
02:44:55,283 --> 02:44:56,961
<i>It wasn't even a choice.</i>

3848
02:44:57,904 --> 02:45:01,008
<i>For the next six hours,
I came up with a list.</i>

3849
02:45:01,199 --> 02:45:04,109
<i>Friends, enemies,
business associates.</i>

3850
02:45:04,209 --> 02:45:05,902
<i>Anybody who 'd ever known me</i>

3851
02:45:06,002 --> 02:45:08,330
<i>or taken so much as a stock tip.</i>

3852
02:45:13,794 --> 02:45:16,238
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3853
02:45:17,923 --> 02:45:19,696
<i>The first name on the
list was Donnie.</i>

3854
02:45:23,094 --> 02:45:24,587
Jordan, do you know how good it is

3855
02:45:24,687 --> 02:45:26,331
to have you back in this office?

3856
02:45:26,598 --> 02:45:28,674
It's not the same when you're gone.

3857
02:45:28,774 --> 02:45:30,467
It's sad, you understand?
It's like...

3858
02:45:30,567 --> 02:45:32,011
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3859
02:45:32,111 --> 02:45:33,262
I can't...

3860
02:45:33,362 --> 02:45:35,139
Swear to God, I can't
even think about it.

3861
02:45:35,239 --> 02:45:37,099
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3862
02:45:37,199 --> 02:45:38,893
I can't even say his name.

3863
02:45:38,993 --> 02:45:40,519
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3864
02:45:40,619 --> 02:45:42,938
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3865
02:45:43,038 --> 02:45:44,117
Ugh!

3866
02:45:44,217 --> 02:45:47,269
He ever get back to
you about that, um...

3867
02:45:47,911 --> 02:45:49,888
About that account?

3868
02:45:55,501 --> 02:45:56,576
You remember.

3869
02:45:56,676 --> 02:45:58,620
It was like 4 or 5 mil,
something like that, right?

3870
02:45:58,720 --> 02:46:01,945
He was supposed
to kick back 4 or 5 mil, was it?

3871
02:46:06,262 --> 02:46:07,754
Actually, I was...

3872
02:46:07,854 --> 02:46:09,214
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3873
02:46:09,314 --> 02:46:10,798
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3874
02:46:10,898 --> 02:46:12,951
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3875
02:46:13,518 --> 02:46:15,093
Well, if he calls you,

3876
02:46:15,193 --> 02:46:17,622
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3877
02:46:19,357 --> 02:46:21,058
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3878
02:46:21,158 --> 02:46:23,303
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3879
02:46:26,614 --> 02:46:29,217
You gonna eat that last piece
of yellowtail, bud?

3880
02:46:30,159 --> 02:46:31,977
No, it's all yours.

3881
02:46:32,704 --> 02:46:34,147
Can I get this?

3882
02:46:36,541 --> 02:46:38,393
So, what else is...

3883
02:46:41,045 --> 02:46:43,080
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3884
02:46:43,180 --> 02:46:44,539
You know how it is.

3885
02:46:44,639 --> 02:46:46,818
She hates my fucking guts.

3886
02:46:48,428 --> 02:46:50,246
How's Hildy? Good?

3887
02:46:50,972 --> 02:46:52,381
She's still alive, so

3888
02:46:52,481 --> 02:46:54,549
my life is fucked, you know?

3889
02:46:54,649 --> 02:46:55,917
Yeah.

3890
02:47:02,608 --> 02:47:04,210
Mr. Jordan.

3891
02:47:04,319 --> 02:47:05,671
Mmm?

3892
02:47:05,778 --> 02:47:08,097
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3893
02:47:08,364 --> 02:47:09,510
What?

3894
02:47:09,865 --> 02:47:11,717
You've got a visitor.

3895
02:47:27,132 --> 02:47:29,208
I need you to get dressed.

3896
02:47:29,308 --> 02:47:31,532
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3897
02:47:36,473 --> 02:47:38,291
You're going to jail.

3898
02:47:50,236 --> 02:47:51,437
All right.

3899
02:47:51,537 --> 02:47:52,980
I'll get some clothes on.

3900
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:55,350
We'll give you a hand with that.

3901
02:48:04,125 --> 02:48:05,272
Okay.

3902
02:48:17,429 --> 02:48:18,746
FBI!

3903
02:48:19,098 --> 02:48:20,590
Everybody sit down. Put your hands

3904
02:48:20,690 --> 02:48:22,717
where they can be seen,
and shut up!

3905
02:48:22,817 --> 02:48:24,510
Don't you fucking touch me.

3906
02:48:24,610 --> 02:48:26,721
Get your fucking hands off me!

3907
02:48:26,821 --> 02:48:28,590
Don't get out of your seats!

3908
02:48:41,745 --> 02:48:43,438
It's fucking Chanel!

3909
02:48:56,009 --> 02:48:58,182
<i>I gave up everyone.</i>

3910
02:48:58,282 --> 02:48:59,796
<i>And in return,</i>

3911
02:48:59,896 --> 02:49:04,292
<i>I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.</i>

3912
02:49:06,102 --> 02:49:08,580
<i>Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,</i>

3913
02:49:09,230 --> 02:49:11,958
<i>"The chickens had
come home to roost."</i>

3914
02:49:13,234 --> 02:49:15,587
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i>

3915
02:49:19,031 --> 02:49:20,356
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i>

3916
02:49:20,456 --> 02:49:22,483
that Mr. Belfort has
distinguished himself

3917
02:49:22,583 --> 02:49:24,652
in terms of his cooperation.

3918
02:49:24,752 --> 02:49:26,779
Mr. Belfort has helped the
government win convictions

3919
02:49:26,879 --> 02:49:29,479
of over two dozen serious offenders

3920
02:49:30,584 --> 02:49:32,535
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3921
02:49:32,635 --> 02:49:36,156
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3922
02:49:38,300 --> 02:49:39,792
The sentence of the court shall be

3923
02:49:39,892 --> 02:49:42,071
36 months in federal prison.

3924
02:49:43,763 --> 02:49:45,991
Please remand the defendant.

3925
02:49:48,101 --> 02:49:49,953
I'm sorry.

3926
02:49:52,731 --> 02:49:53,878
That's okay.

3927
02:50:42,154 --> 02:50:44,647
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i>

3928
02:50:44,747 --> 02:50:46,566
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i>

3929
02:50:46,666 --> 02:50:48,890
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

3930
02:50:49,578 --> 02:50:50,945
Belfort, on your feet.

3931
02:50:51,045 --> 02:50:53,394
<i>But I needn't have been.</i>

3932
02:50:53,541 --> 02:50:56,234
<i>You see, for a brief
fleeting moment,</i>

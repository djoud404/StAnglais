Have you ever felt discriminated against

- Well, yes.
- In what way?

Well, Mr. Wheeler's secretary,
Lydia...

JOE:
Really?

831
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:43,360
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt that they
were too "ethnic," is the word she used.

832
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:47,864
She told me he said that he would like it
if I wore something a little less garish...

...a little smaller
and more "American."

Could it be that these...

are in fact misunderstandings...

...that have been blown
completely out of proportion?

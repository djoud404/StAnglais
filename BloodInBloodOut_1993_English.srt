1
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,803
So what's the difference
between East L.A. and L.A.?

2
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,810
It's a whole
different country.

3
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,472
Hope it works out better
for you here than in Vegas.

4
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,481
It's got to.
It's home.

5
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,428
<i>You're not gonna get anything
like this in Las Vegas.</i>

6
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,431
<i>You got that right. I been
dreamin'about these for 18 months.</i>

7
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,333
<i>- No, mi hijo. Como siempre.
- Gracias. Eighteen months.</i>

8
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,338
Say hello to your mother.
And stay outta trouble!

9
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>Orale.</i>

10
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>Hey, hey!
¡ Cuidado, mi hijo!</i>

11
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:55,539
<i>Jesse! I'm gonna need
a trim, homes. ¿Cuando?</i>

12
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,804
<i>- Manana a las once.
- Orale.</i>

13
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:33,941
<i>Miklo, tell those wetbacks
to step on it, or they ain't gonna get paid.</i>

14
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,642
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you!

15
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,708
Get their asses movin'.
I got two more trucks on the way.

16
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,913
I'm already humpin'
and you ordered too much.

17
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,253
<i>That's 1,500 bucks of mud. Tell them to
get it down, or they can pay for it.</i>

18
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,623
Your mistake.
Tell 'em yourself.

19
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,992
Don't ever take the side of the Mexican
over your father! Just tell 'em!

20
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,861
<i>- Fuck you!
- You ungrateful little punk!</i>

21
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,832
<i>I'm the one that
kept you out ofjail!</i>

22
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,233
You love 'em so much, you can get
the same thing they're gettin' paid.

23
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,431
<i>- I'll get a man to run this group.
- You son-of-a-bitch!</i>

24
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,907
<i>Find yourself another slave, Dad!</i>

25
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,001
<i>- You're through!
- I'm goin'home!</i>

26
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:07,377
<i>You're fired! I'm telling
your probation officer!</i>

27
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,849
I wish I could have
seen your father's face.

28
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,750
You beat him up.

29
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,089
<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i>

30
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,927
<i>Ay, Miklo, he'll kill me
if he finds you here!</i>

31
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,398
Don't worry, Mama. He ain't never
gonna touch you again.

32
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,732
<i>- Not after what I done.
- I know that cabron. He'll turn you in.</i>

33
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,363
Miklo, come.
Help do me up.

34
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,536
You know, if the judge finds out
you're here, he's gonna stop my check.

35
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,740
I need that money.
Whoo, baby, cold hands!

36
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:47,219
<i>Oye, mami. En seis días, just six
little days, bingo, I'm home free.</i>

37
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:51,622
<i>Ay, bingo. What's this bingo? What
are you gonna be doing in six days?</i>

38
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,957
<i>Mi cumpleanos.
June 28th.</i>

39
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,897
My birthday, remember?
I'll be off probation.

40
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,799
A birthday.
Ooh, eighteen.

41
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,803
<i>Que macho.
Que macho.</i>

42
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,839
<i>Mami, mami, mami.</i>

43
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,467
<i>But to me you're always gonna be
my little chavalito, huh?</i>

44
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,014
<i>Oye, I'm late.
Beto hates to wait.</i>

45
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,017
Hey, Miklo. You can stay with
your Aunt Dolores, huh?

46
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,144
<i>Come on.
We'll drop you.</i>

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,324
<i>Shh, shh, shh.
Hola, Luisa. Shh.</i>

48
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,490
<i>¿Dolores?</i>

49
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,229
<i>¡Dolores!</i>

50
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:47,837
<i>¡Ay, nino! Oh,
so good to see you!</i>

51
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>Ay, Paco.
Paco, venga aqui.</i>

52
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,020
<i>¡Ooi, ya cha-chai,
ya cha-chai!</i>

53
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,113
You're so tall!

54
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,785
- How long are you here?
- Uh, I'm back for good.

55
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,560
- Your probation is over?
- No, no. Uh, he's got a birthday coming up.

56
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,033
<i>Look, um,
I gotta go.</i>

57
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,366
Dolores, Miklo's gonna stay
with you for a while, okay?

58
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,099
- Why?
- Because you have so much more room.

59
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,505
<i>I love you, nino, huh?</i>

60
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:21,611
Lupe, you may be my sister, but I'm
tired of taking care of you. Grow up!

61
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,310
<i>Look, I have tried to
be like you. I can't.</i>

62
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,512
<i>- Your life would drive me crazy!
- Ooh, orale.</i>

63
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,216
- The Pillsbury doughboy's back in town.
- Back for good, homes.

64
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,589
<i>- ¿Que tal?
- What's happening, man?</i>

65
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,685
Thought you was never
coming back, eh.

66
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,196
Hey, you know me. I always find my way
back to East Los, homes.

67
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,323
You couldn't hang with your
white boy daddy or what?

68
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,360
Paco, Miklo's gonna be staying with us
for a while, huh? Make room for him.

69
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,964
Ain't no one share my bed
and TV but a woman.

70
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:52,274
<i>- This puto's staying in the garage, eh.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

71
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,283
You're not the rooster here,
huh? This is my house.

72
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,484
Miklo's your cousin.

73
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:12,989
Take this electric bill over to Mano and
tell him it has to be paid this afternoon.

74
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,730
<i>Better keep the blankets
over your head, pendejo,</i>

75
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:22,469
so your fluorescent skin don't keep me
awake all night. Come on.

76
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,842
<i>Hey, check out this
fucking "3 P", ese.</i>

77
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,746
Since when do we let Tres Puntos
get away with that shit, homes?

78
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,011
Big badass vato.
3 P ain't nothin'...

79
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,918
but a bunch of fuckin' paint sniffers
who sneak in here at night.

80
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:38,048
<i>- They ain't about shit, ese.
- They are shit, ese.</i>

81
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,719
Why the fuck do you come
all the way back here?

82
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,890
'Cause you owe me five bucks, ese,
and I came back to collect with this!

83
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,492
Fuck you! I'm gonna
kick your ass, milkweed!

84
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,594
Come on,
Jolly Green Giant!

85
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,930
I'm gonna kick
your ass, milkweed!

86
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,517
<i>Orale, mi hijo,
this is Quetzalcoatl,</i>

87
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,076
the great Aztec
poet king.

88
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,349
<i>He ruled
the kingdom of Aztlan...</i>

89
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,153
<i>that was from Mexico
all the way up here to Califas.</i>

90
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,660
<i>Sexy mamacita.</i>

91
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,754
<i>Pay attention, pelao. I'm gonna
teach you all about Aztlan.</i>

92
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,096
<i>'Cause this vato's coming back some day
to reclaim the raza's kingdom.</i>

93
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,331
<i>- Huacha! Eee!
- Ah, parece, pero...</i>

94
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,373
why do you put
my initials on?

95
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,739
<i>Because you help me, ese.
We did it together, carnalito.</i>

96
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,438
<i>Hijo.</i>

97
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,500
<i>- Hey, Paco, what's up?
- Chale, ese, you can't sneak up on us,</i>

98
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,869
<i>not with Luis's
feathered watchdogs on duty.</i>

99
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,103
<i>Oye, el gallo negro looks pretty mean, ese.</i>

100
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,270
<i>I'd put some feria on him.</i>

101
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,611
<i>- ¡Orale! ¡Huacha!
- Cruzito!</i>

102
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,650
<i>El Miklo.
El Miklo Velka.</i>

103
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:58,415
<i>What's happening, ese?
When'd you parachute in, milkweed?</i>

104
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,649
Today, from Vegas.

105
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:04,421
<i>High roller, ¿o que?
Mira, papa.</i>

106
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,860
<i>- Miklo.
- ¡Hola, Tio Mano!</i>

107
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,798
<i>- Miklo! What are you doing here?
- Nada.</i>

108
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:14,098
- How's your father?
- Oh, he's, he's okay.

109
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,900
<i>- ¿Ytu jefita?
- My mom wants you to pay that.</i>

110
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,907
<i>No te tucha.</i>

111
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,102
When you gonna pay
your share?

112
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,270
<i>Chale.</i>

113
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,837
I'm on the K-Mart
pay as you can plan, eh.

114
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:30,786
You done anything
about the Corps?

115
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,822
I talked to the recruiter, Bentley.
He's waiting for you.

116
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:35,119
And take orders from
a jarhead like you?

117
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,182
Forget it. I ain't
with that party.

118
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,888
<i>You may be my stepfather,
but you ain't my commanding officer.</i>

119
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:42,523
You eat and you
sleep in my house,

120
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,830
and as long as you do,
don't you talk to me like that!

121
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,139
Si.

122
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,300
<i>Venga, hijo.</i>

123
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,708
I wanna stay
with Cruz.

124
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,044
- Have you done your homework?
- Yeah.

125
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,049
In the truck.

126
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:09,290
Hey, take it easy on Mano, homes.
He just wants you to work.

127
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,351
Hey, he's your dad, not mine.
Let him tell you what to do, eh.

128
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:14,397
I'm just telling you, ese.
You don't have to mad-dog me.

129
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,062
<i>- Chale, it's a customer's ride. We can't use it.
- That's bullshit.</i>

130
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,070
Where do you want
to go, Vegas vato?

131
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:26,507
<i>Hey, Cruz!</i>

132
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,876
<i>Chale, I told you,
we can't take that ride.</i>

133
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,683
<i>Don't cry.</i>

134
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:41,190
<i>All right, but this time we gotta
go down Brooklyn and Whittier, ese.</i>

135
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:48,993
Just like the old days, man. Remember
when you were living at Paco's mom's house?

136
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,363
This dude
was rotten, Holmes.

137
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:55,666
<i>- He threw some mean bombs.
- Chale, that's bullshit, ese.</i>

138
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,175
<i>No, really. You woke up all the babies
in the barrio, ese.</i>

139
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,733
Chickens couldn't
lay eggs for a month.

140
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:05,008
You're the one throwing bombs.
Elephant farts.

141
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,415
- Hey, do that baby on acid face that you do, man.
- Oh, that's stupid.

142
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,420
<i>- Just do it, ese.
- All right.</i>

143
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:21,994
That tree
is East Los to me.

144
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:24,124
It's good to be home.

145
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,226
<i>¿Que no? Hey,
¿sabes que, ese?</i>

146
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,567
My paintings
made it to the finals.

147
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,607
<i>- ¿De veras, man? You really made it?
- Simon.</i>

148
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,665
<i>In all of Califas,
I'm still in.</i>

149
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,768
<i>- Orale.
- Te aventaste.</i>

150
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:38,006
They'll give the prize
to you. You're the best.

151
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,140
<i>- Not bad for a Chicano, eh?
- ¿Que no?</i>

152
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:43,811
<i>- Oye, Cruzito.
- ¿Que pasa?</i>

153
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,378
<i>- You still have your quills and inks?
- Simon. ¿Por que?</i>

154
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,391
Get down, James Brown.
Put the needle in, huh?

155
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,620
<i>I want
my V.L. Tattoo.</i>

156
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,753
<i>Hey, take a look
in the mirror, guero.</i>

157
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,230
<i>Does it snow in L.A.?</i>

158

What seems to be
the problem, sir?

172
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,141
Bumper clearance has gotta
be at least ten inches.

173
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:43,509
- Oh, really?
- You, in the car.

He's got a great record.

180
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:13,440
"The Black Rooster."
Thirteen K.O.'s.

181
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,073
He's got a great
right uppercut.

182
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:23,209
You, uh, used to train at
the Boys' Club, didn't you?

Thank you, officer. We will, sir.

So, Cruz, here's your plaque.
Your award of honor.

when I used to draw...

259
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:56,688
little cards for my mom
when she was sick in the hospital.

260
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,489
Those little cards
made her happy,

261
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:04,090
<i>and she told me then,
"Mijo, tu eres un artista."</i>

262

You are an artist.

Another fish tank

Two down

532
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:24,995
Feel the pain, man. Come on,
keep it going. Keep it going. Come on.

533
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,995
<i>Some fresh meat

<i>Come on, Ryder,

Come on, man.
Come on, Ryder.

Fuckin' fresh fish, man.
Can you believe that shit?

00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,048
58-271.

539
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:55,617
<i>Okay, come on. Pick it

00:36:57,898 --> 00:37:01,356
Pick it up. What you strollin' for?
Move it along. Let's go!

541
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:06,065
<i>Hey, baby, long time since I had a West Texas
ballroom bitch. How 'bout you bein'my lady?</i>

00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:10,667
<i>Say, you, black baby. This bull

00:37:10,744 --> 00:37:13,577
I got what you need.
Put that punk in a cell with me.

544
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:17,083
<i>Orale, blue eyes. Mamacita, look

545
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,608
You don't listen to anybody but me.
Do you understand that?

546
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:23,451
I'm The Man. I'm the boss.
Do you understand?

547
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:25,991
Now, walk!

548
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:28,687
Go to the door.
White sign over the door.

549
00:37:28,762 --> 00:37:32,994
Your chains will come off. You'll drop
your drawers and you'll be home.

550
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:35,000
Welcome to San Quentin.

551
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:38,003
...515, you got visitors.

552
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:40,005
<i>Carney.</i>

553
00:37:40,073 --> 00:37:42,837
<i>- What's your number?
- Um, I don't remember, sir.</i>

554
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:44,934
<i>Learn it.</i>

555
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,845
<i>Sweeney, B56-212.</i>

<i>Move it out.
Let's go.</i>

558
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:07,828
What the fuck

559
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:12,998
<i>Hey, smells like fish!</i>

560
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:39,258
Come on.
Get it in.

561
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:50,436
I'm the interior officer. You got
any problems, you gotta see me.

562
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:19,271
- Do what you wanna do.
- Look who's there.

563
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:21,671
Hey, Cruz, look what
Grandpa got you.

564
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:24,506
- Juanito, doesn't he look good?
- Yeah, homes.

<i>How you doing?

566
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,948
Hey, homes, that operation you got?
It makes you look good as new, homes.

567
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:33,144
Wait 'til you see
your surprise.

568
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,586
<i>- Simon. - Surprise? -
Just around the corner.</i>

569
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,851
<i>Huacha, eh?</i>

570
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:44,055
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

571
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:49,557
<i>The Corps is making
a man of him.</i>

572
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:57,272
<i>- Hey, carnal.
- Qu'iubo, champ.</i>

573
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:59,209
I'll walk from here.

574
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,906
<i>Oh, no, no. Cruz, no.</i>

575
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,745
<i>- Mi hijo, do you think you should?
- Oh, yeah, I'm...</i>

576
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:06,684
<i>- Ama. ¿Me hacen un favor?
- Si.</i>

577
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:09,119
<i>- Let me and Paco walk by ourselves to the car.
- Si, si. That's fine.</i>

578
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:11,157
- Can I go with you guys?
- We'll go.

579
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:14,022
<i>- Can I go with you?
- I'll see you in a minute, mocoso. Go with mama.</i>

580
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:17,222
<i>We'll get the car.
Vengan, niños. Dolores.</i>

581
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:20,323
<i>- Bye, mi hijo.
- Hey, Cruzito, see you at the car, huh?</i>

582
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,062
<i>- Andale, andale, Juanito.
- Later, homey.</i>

583
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:26,367
He doesn't
look so good.

584
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,373
Look at me.
Look it.

585
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:31,069
You all right, man?

586
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:37,973
<i>¡Ay! Pinche
pierna, homes.</i>

587
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:43,614
Let me get 'em.

588
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:49,995
More, more.

589
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:53,928
- There we go.
- Those help you?

590
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,936
They don't do shit.
Morphine's the ticket, though.

591
00:41:00,006 --> 00:41:03,203
Can't run,
can't sleep.

592
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:05,836
Can't play
the accordion.

593
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:10,281
<i>- Hope I can still paint, carnal.
- You will, carnal, you will.</i>

594
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,547
<i>Mira, vato.
A fuckin' Marine, ese.</i>

595
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,919
<i>- Chingao.
- It was either this or jail, right?</i>

596
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,050
But after boot camp, I ain't so sure
it was such a good deal.

597
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:22,492
A lot better
than Miklo, homes.

598
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:25,963
<i>Pobre milkweed.</i>

599
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:45,016
Wanna buy
some cigarettes?

600
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:49,413
What's happenin'?
How are you?

601
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,548
<i>- Hey, baby.
- Hola, pretty.</i>

602
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,650
Are you blond

603
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:55,718
Get your hands
off of me, faggot!

604
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:59,754
Ooh, how his blue eyes just

605
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:02,131
Leave me alone, man!

606
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:04,796
I'll kill you, bitch!

607
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:07,806
Oh! You will?

608
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:22,116
<i>Where the fuck you get that
placa, Little Bo Peep?</i>

609
00:42:24,724 --> 00:42:28,216
Hey, Cinderella,
go find yourself a fella.

610
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,264
You're on the clock, bitch,
and midnight is comin'.

611
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:37,133
<i>You got the wrong man.
¿Como te llamas?</i>

612
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:40,138
Miklo Velka.

613
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:49,275
<i>¡Orale, vato!</i>

614
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:52,147
There's some vatos
you should meet.

615
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,420
Most of these cons don't clique.
They just fill in space, doin' time.

616
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:00,652
It's the gangs
that run this place.

617
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,455
See a black dude
with a comb over there?

618
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:08,194
<i>That's Bonafide.
He runs the B.G.A.,</i>

619
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:10,327
<i>the Black Guerilla Army.</i>

620
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:16,205
Don't take nothin' from him, or you'll end
up with a Black Power comb through your heart.

621
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:22,010
- What's your problem, man?
- Hey, I got no problem, brother.

622
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,812
That's a fuckin'
fine comb you got.

623
00:43:26,886 --> 00:43:29,446
- You should give it to one of my bitches.
- Watch your mouth, sucker.

624
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:34,357
<i>- Put your spear down.
- Don't you know this comb has power?</i>

625
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:36,520
- Black power.
- Yeah.

626
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:40,259
<i>- Right on.
- Power to give a fool like you nightmares,</i>

627
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,996
- but see, you wouldn't understand that.
- Ain't nothing to me, ese.

628
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,935
Yeah, I know it.

629
00:43:51,244 --> 00:43:54,907
Those polar bears over in the corner,
that's Aryan Vanguard,

630
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:56,915
<i>the AV-ers.</i>

631
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:59,850
<i>Those white boys control the dope trade,
do free-lance killings, anything...</i>

632
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:03,480
- for the right price.
- I'm about finished waitin' for my money, punk.

633
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:08,289
Hey, why not take it out in trade? You
always liked Tinkerbell. She's fine.

634
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:12,593
You bet cash, you lose cash,
you pay cash, pimpmobile.

635
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:16,726
<i>Soon, or I'll have to hire
Red Ryder here and his A. V. Boys...</i>

636
00:44:16,803 --> 00:44:20,796
to cut some fat off
that tongue of yours!

637
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:24,310
Or maybe you'd like to swap for
some of that tender white meat.

638
00:44:24,377 --> 00:44:26,607
<i>You can pay
your bets with that.</i>

639
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:31,542
<i>Suave, Al.</i>

640
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:35,884
I'll pay you what I owe, but don't try
scaring me with your A.V. Insurance policy...

641
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:38,822
'cause remember, I got
a policy with Ryder too.

642
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:42,123
<i>He knows better than to mess
with a good customer.</i>

643
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:46,024
Since business
is so good,

644
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:49,762
I suppose I'm gonna have to raise
the rents on both you lame-ass fucks!

645
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:55,899
What's the matter?
You never heard of rent control?

646
00:44:55,975 --> 00:45:00,309
Easy on the threats, Ryder.

647
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:06,046
You got the vatos back there.
You don't want to do anything in public.

648
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:15,058
We're talking
business here.

649
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,957
Fuck him.

650
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,361
<i>Just tuvo, Beto.
It's over.</i>

651
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,906
<i>¿Ese pues que
chinga trae?</i>

652
00:45:31,978 --> 00:45:34,378
<i>Why the fuck you let these putos
disrespect you like that for?</i>

653
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:37,541
<i>- Take it easy, carnal.
- You're wrecking it for the rest of the homeboys.</i>

654
00:45:37,617 --> 00:45:39,414
<i>I'm just showing
this homeboy around, okay?</i>

655
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,284
<i>It's Miklo,
from el barrio.</i>

656
00:45:42,355 --> 00:45:44,289
You're the sucker
that dusted Spider?

657
00:45:46,025 --> 00:45:48,994
Well, if a rep is what
you're lookin' for, killer...

658
00:45:50,597 --> 00:45:52,758
then I'm the man you want.

659
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,800
<i>Mira. Tres Puntos,
like Spider.</i>

660
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:00,601
<i>- Ooh! I'm the bogeyman!
- He pissed in his pants.</i>

661
00:46:04,677 --> 00:46:06,907
<i>- ¡Pinche Vato Loco!
- Come on, carnal.</i>

662
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,505
<i>Get the fuck outta here
before I make you my bitch.</i>

663
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:12,142
- He's Tres Puntos, ese.
- Hey!

664
00:46:12,218 --> 00:46:14,209
That's
street bullshit, ese.

665
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:16,619
It's different
in the joint.

666
00:46:16,689 --> 00:46:20,284
We clique together.
Power, to protect ourselves.

667
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,127
<i>So Tres Puntos or anybody strong enough
to stand with La Onda is okay.</i>

668
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:28,258
<i>- What's La Onda?
- Some questions you don't ask.</i>

669
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:32,498
<i>Escort!
Move it over!</i>

670
00:46:33,706 --> 00:46:37,540
Dead man walking.

671
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:40,807
Back up!

672
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,575
Back it up.

673
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:51,219
<i>Escort!
Back it up!</i>

674
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:54,954
Death row's over there.
For all of California.

675
00:46:55,028 --> 00:46:57,258
<i>Escort!</i>

676
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:14,708
- Got some smokes for you.
- I don't smoke cigarettes.

677
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:20,050
Got a little
something else.

678
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:22,747
- Some juju weed.
- I smoke that now, vato.

679
00:47:22,822 --> 00:47:25,985
You don't mind if I keep you
under my wing for a little while?

680
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:28,152
- I mean, I gotta take care of you, huh?
- Okay, vato.

681
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:30,753
- Hey, we homeboys, right?
- Fuckin' A. East Los rules, vato.

682
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,958
<i>- Gracias, carnal, okay?
- Orale. Simon.</i>

683
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,770
<i>All right, you white bitch.
Gimme some chon-chon!</i>

684
00:47:42,842 --> 00:47:46,608
- Get away from me.
- You get nothing for free in here, punk.

685
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:49,011
<i>- ¡Chinga tu madre!
- Ah?</i>

686
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:51,516
- Okay.
- Ah?

687
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:55,645
That's right, give it up.
Oh, shit! Yii!

688
00:47:55,722 --> 00:47:58,452
<i>¡Pinche puta!</i>

689
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:06,055
<i>You want me to take it? Huh?
You want me to rape you, eh, puto?</i>

690
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:09,499
<i>- Aaah!
- Let's see the color of your blood, gabacho.</i>

691
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:28,020
<i>I'm gonna cut that fucking placa
off of you. You ain't no Vato Loco!</i>

692
00:48:55,014 --> 00:48:57,414
Keep your business
off this tier.

693
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:02,919
- Simon.
- Ese, Pepe don't belong in La Onda.

694
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:05,617
<i>It's low class.
We're better than that.</i>

695
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,183
<i>Chale. My business has
nothing to do with La Onda.</i>

696
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:12,095
<i>- ¡Madera! You're part of the clica.
- I was Onda before you were.</i>

697
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:19,103
<i>Keep your whores
in the rec room.</i>

698
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:20,764
Keep that fuckin' thing
in there!

699
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:27,371
<i>Orale, carnales.</i>

700
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:35,313
Popeye's getting
on my nerves.

701
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:40,525
Come on,
you debutantes!

702
00:49:40,593 --> 00:49:43,357
Got a once-a-year
special on pork chops!

703
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:45,989
Sweet thing! This shit
will make a man impotent,

704
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:48,033
but you ain't goin'
to no prom soon.

705
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:51,764
Eat up, folks, eat up.

706
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,433
Shit, man, ain't nothin' but fat
on that bone. Gimme another chop.

707
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:57,772
Hate like hell to disappoint
your gods, bro,

708
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:00,779
- but unless you got a carton of smokes, no seconds.
- Motherfucker!

709
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:03,315
Our Lord is blushing!

710
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:05,647
- I ain't no Moslem, man.
- All right.

711
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:08,448
- How about a little wager on this weekend's game?
- Your odds stink...

712
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:10,580
and I ain't movin'
'til I get another chop.

713
00:50:10,656 --> 00:50:13,454
Move on, nigger, before I
carpet my cell with your black skin.

714
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:15,824
<i>- Hey, mother...
- All right, what's the holdup?</i>

715
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:17,829
Johnson, move it.

716
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:22,290
Punk-ass motherfucker!

717
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:26,668
All right, all the rest of you hungry
bunnies, get 'em while we got 'em.

718
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:29,071
There's your chop.
You happy now?

719
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:33,972
All right, now for
my brown brothers.

720
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:38,346
Sorry, no tortilla.
Wait a minute.

721
00:50:38,418 --> 00:50:41,546
<i>There's a ray of sunshine in
all that darkness down there.</i>

722
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:45,022
Come up here,
sweetness.

723
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,025
<i>Come on, muevete.</i>

724
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:49,186
You're keepin' all these
hungry beaners waitin', baby.

725
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:53,930
- Move on down!
- What are you doin'? What's the holdup?

726
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,833
It's okay, Sarge. He was outta line.
He was in here before.

727
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:01,431
Gimme your tray, homes.

728
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:05,567
You're catchin' a ride
on the wrong train.

729
00:51:08,714 --> 00:51:11,512
You oughta be at the front of the line,
ahead of those jungle bunnies.

730
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:14,144
I don't take no free tickets
on no one's train!

731
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,383
Now you take a ticket,
or you get run over.

732
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:22,224
It's better to ride up front, first
class, and eat with the white folks.

733
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:26,222
Know what I mean?

734
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:34,870
- Flirt on your own time, Albert.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo, she's jealous!

735
00:51:36,142 --> 00:51:38,940
- Hey, where's my chop?
- That was the last one.

736
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:43,880
<i>- I want my fuckin' chop, puerco.
- Please be courteous to the help. We've run out.</i>

737
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,044
We only get pork once a year.
I know you got more back there.

738
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,111
Only for the kitchen detail.
Perhaps one of them might sell you one.

739
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:53,056
- I ain't buyin' what's mine!
- You know the fuckin' trip. No freebies.

740
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:55,184
<i>- Your mama was a freebie!
- ¡Calmala!</i>

741
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:57,252
Hey, tough guy.
You want a write-up?

742
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,026
Maybe you wanna go
to lockup, huh?

743
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:03,694
<i>Calmala, carnal.</i>

744
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:08,001
Move it! Come on, we got
ten minutes here. Let's eat.

745
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:15,404
You sold our meat, Al. You been
gettin' by with that shit too long.

746
00:52:15,481 --> 00:52:20,544
We ran out. It happens. Now move on,
flycatcher. Got hungry men behind ya.

747
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:25,148
I'm gonna fold your bluffing hand
some day, you chicken-shit motherfucker.

748
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:29,092
In your dreams, Pedro.
In your dreams.

749
00:52:29,161 --> 00:52:31,129
<i>- A la chingadita.
- Chale. Calmala.</i>

750
00:52:45,077 --> 00:52:47,739
Where the fuck do you think
you're trespassing into?

751
00:52:47,813 --> 00:52:50,509
Orale, calmala.
Calmala.

752
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,744
<i>- Clavate.
- What do you want?</i>

753
00:52:52,818 --> 00:52:55,116
- I thought you wanted it.
- What?

754
00:52:55,187 --> 00:52:57,348
My chop.

755
00:53:02,094 --> 00:53:05,552
I don't want his pork chop.

756
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:13,004
I want his life.

757
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:08,383
<i>¿Que quieres, vato?</i>

758
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:11,225
<i>Oye, why don't you go play
with the polar bears...</i>

759
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:15,427
<i>or the mayates?</i>

760
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:19,096
- What's Toluca?
- That's the Aztec ball court.

761
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:22,607
Where you lose...
you die.

762
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:26,873
I'm gonna drop you, white boy!

763
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:30,177
Go ahead, drop me. I ain't
afraid to die. Come on!

764
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:31,978
Come on!
Come on!

765
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:40,087
Hey, boy. That shit wouldn't happen
if you're up here with Daddy.

766
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:42,491
Fuckin'...

767
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:49,970
<i>Vamonos.</i>

768
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,472
<i>Andale, andale.</i>

769
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:08,951
<i>You speak Spanish, guero.
So do parrots.</i>

770
00:55:09,023 --> 00:55:11,958
<i>I'm in here for
backing up a carnal.</i>

771
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:17,157
<i>I killed a Tres Puntos 'cause he was
gonna take out my partner. Soy chicano.</i>

772
00:55:24,004 --> 00:55:27,565
Chicanos killing Chicanos
is what they want.

773
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:31,634
Blacks and Chicanos killing
each other is what they want.

774
00:55:31,712 --> 00:55:34,272
<i>That's how they
run this place.</i>

775
00:55:34,348 --> 00:55:36,976
Once we get together,
they don't run shit.

776
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,486
<i>You got a lot to learn
about being Chicano, guero.</i>

777
00:55:41,555 --> 00:55:44,854
I'm no lightweight, and the color
of my skin shouldn't keep me out.

778
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,189
White is the enemy.

779
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,491
White's the system.

780
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:52,031
You're stuck
in the middle.

781
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,362
All my fuckin' life
I've been kept out.

782
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,340
You know what that
feels like?

783
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:06,038
Knowing you're a Chicano and no one
accepts you 'cause your skin came out white?

784
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,081
<i>My mom's as brown
as you are,</i>

785
00:56:08,148 --> 00:56:12,778
and my white dad tried to beat
every ounce of her outta me.

786
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:16,118
But you know what?
He couldn't do it.

787
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:20,286
Chicano's not a color. It's the way
you think and the way you live.

788
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,420
<i>And if you're willing to give
your life up for a carnal.</i>

789
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,559
I'm here to do that.
Use me. Use this.

790
00:56:32,906 --> 00:56:34,874
<i>¿Como?</i>

791
00:56:34,942 --> 00:56:38,742
You said it. Everything's
based on color, right?

792
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,373
I can get places you can't
'cause my skin's white on the outside.

793
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:47,315
But I'm brown on the inside.
To the bones.

794
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:53,753
The only way into La Onda is
to take down one of our enemies.

795
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,954
In your case, it would
have to be somebody big.

796
00:56:56,029 --> 00:57:00,398
<i>Someone we can't hit without
losing a lot of carnales.</i>

797
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:03,800
<i>- Chale.
- Gimme a chance!</i>

798
00:57:03,871 --> 00:57:06,635
Trust me.
Just one chance!

799
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:08,800
<i>Estoy listo.</i>

800
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:16,072
<i>Respect is everything, guero.
You ready to die for it?</i>

801
00:57:17,618 --> 00:57:19,552
<i>Vamos a ver.</i>

802
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:22,778
Blood in, blood out.

803
00:57:29,897 --> 00:57:33,993
<i>- Entiendes?
- Todo.</i>

804
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,552
<i>We start cookin'
breakfast at 4:30 a.m.</i>

805
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,592
Start dinner at 2:00. I'm startin' you
on pots and pans, with the niggers.

806
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,221
Thanks for nothin'.
I'll take whatever I can get, Al.

807
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,755
- Whatever you say.
- That's right, baby-cake.

808
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,893
I knew you'd
wise up, sunshine.

809
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,437
That greaser pimp can't do
half what I can do for you.

810
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,669
- Sounds nice.
- Hey, Gil. Tell Red Ryder I got that protein powder he wanted.

811
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:08,281
See that? You learn to treat me
right and you get it all.

812
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,785
Food, coffee,
sex, drugs.

813
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,015
Hell, the works.
Come on over here.

814
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,057
Hey, clear outta here.

815
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,923
It's off-limits to everybody
but me and the staff.

816
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:24,697
Go on in.
Hey... you like that?

817
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,793
Oh, that's nice.

818
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,237
Yeah, so's this.

819
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,108
So this is where you
keep all the goodies, huh?

820
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,239
Some of'em.

821
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,943
- Pinto beans?
- No pintos for you, baby.

822
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,320
Nothin' but
Texas barbecue.

823
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,121
How 'bout it,
sweet teeth?

824
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,289
Just remember, Al.

825
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:59,199
I fuck who I want,
when I want.

826
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,534
All right. It's all right.
Take it easy. It's all right.

827
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:07,508
You treat me right, everything's
gonna be all crimson and clover.

828
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:13,246
Popeye tried to take it.
Almost cut his dick off!

829
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,178
Well, I can wait, baby.

830
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:21,883
That spic's a pig.
Got no class.

831
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,893
Just don't make Daddy
wait too long.

832
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,257
Come on, now.
Come on.

833
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:56,819
- You wild little bitch.
- This is just a sample.

834
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:01,887
<i>- I'm gonna fuck your brains out!
- When I'm ready, Al.</i>

835
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,195
<i>When I'm ready.</i>

836
01:00:22,102 --> 01:00:26,300
<i>¡Ay, mi hijo!
The prices, they're so high.</i>

837
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,570
<i>The prices don't mean nothing
unless they sell that much.</i>

838
01:00:29,643 --> 01:00:31,804
Cruz, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

839
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,745
- I'm saying good-bye to my family.
- We were just leaving.

840
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:43,184
Hey, Cruz, can you buy me
a low-rider when you get rich?

841
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:45,884
<i>- ¿Que low-rider? ¡Andale! Usted tambien,
senorita. - I wanna stay with Cruz.</i>

842
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:48,018
- Bye, Alicia.
- Come with me, Cruz.

843
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:51,826
<i>People want to meet you. You've
got to circulate. You're the artist.</i>

844
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:58,529
- Janis!
- Oh, God.

845
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:03,804
- Janis, what a find.
- Cruz, say hello to Lois and Jared Levinson.

846
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:06,607
<i>Cruz Candelaria.
Mucho gusto.</i>

847
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:12,613
<i>You, uh, make them look so noble.
So, uh... fuerte.</i>

848
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,456
I paint what I see.
So you really like it, huh?

849
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:21,426
<i>- Oh, yes.
- I'm sorry, but I've gotta take him to a press photo.</i>

850
01:01:21,495 --> 01:01:23,429
<i>- We'll bring him back in a few minutes.
- All right.</i>

851
01:01:23,497 --> 01:01:25,761
Janis, what are
you doing?

852
01:01:25,832 --> 01:01:28,528
- They were gonna buy something.
- Oh, they're looky-loos.

853
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,627
- Window-shoppers.
- How do you know that, Janis?

854
01:01:30,704 --> 01:01:32,899
I thought we agreed to keep
tonight strictly business.

855
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:35,168
Yeah. So?

856
01:01:36,243 --> 01:01:39,838
They went in.
How come they went in?

857
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:41,972
We both have
a lot at stake, Cruz.

858
01:01:42,049 --> 01:01:44,108
Don't let them
blow it.

859
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:47,683
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

860
01:01:47,754 --> 01:01:49,722
Gentlemen, your names
are not on the list,

861
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,951
and if you don't have an invitation,
you can't come in here.

862
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:55,153
<i>Look, we don't need our names
on the list, ruca.</i>

863
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:57,162
<i>You see that face
up there? That's me.</i>

864
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,357
<i>Whether that's you
or not, it doesn't matter.</i>

865
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:01,458
Miss Weinstock needs to say
that it's okay for you to come in.

866
01:02:01,535 --> 01:02:04,402
<i>Orale. Have yourselves a good time. Enjoy
yourselves. There, there's my invitation.</i>

867
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,268
<i>Okay? Gracias.</i>

868
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:09,331
<i>Hey, hey, hey. It's okay, Belinda.
It's all right.</i>

869
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:14,176
<i>- It's okay, Belinda.
- ¿Que paso, locos?</i>

870
01:02:14,247 --> 01:02:17,307
Hey, Cruzito.
Congratulations.

871
01:02:20,587 --> 01:02:22,612
<i>Orale, Gilbert.
In a minute, homes.</i>

872
01:02:22,689 --> 01:02:24,714
<i>Come check out
the carrucha, carnal.</i>

873
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:27,157
<i>- Orale.
- Orale, Cruzito.</i>

874
01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:30,390
"Cruz Candelaria," vato.
This is big time, homes.

875
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:36,393
<i>Oye, it's too bright
in here, ese. Too much white.</i>

876
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,665
Hey, Cruzito, homes.

877
01:02:38,738 --> 01:02:41,832
What happened to
our invitation?

878
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:43,842
What, are you
ashamed of Frankie?

879
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:46,811
<i>- Are you ashamed of me?
- Si, babosos. I'm glad you came.</i>

880
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,007
<i>But why'd you have to
bring Gilbert, that culero.</i>

881
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:51,516
You know Gilbert can smell money
from across town, homes.

882
01:02:51,585 --> 01:02:53,712
<i>- No shit.
- He came to help you spend that plata.</i>

883
01:02:53,787 --> 01:02:55,755
Oh, shit, I can't
pay him now, ese.

884
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:58,484
<i>No mas tengo diez bolas.
I've only got ten bucks to my name.</i>

885
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:02,187
- What, with those prices?
- Hey, shit, I ain't sold nothing, ese.

886
01:03:02,262 --> 01:03:05,629
<i>Well, maybe if we jack up
a few of these maricones, vato.</i>

887
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,690
I got the guy
in the bell-bottoms.

888
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:09,826
- And I'll take everyone without a bra, vato.
- Be cool, ese.

889
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:12,997
- I'm trying to hold it together.
- Gilbert wants his full payback...

890
01:03:13,073 --> 01:03:15,234
- before he's gonna give me some new credit.
- Shh. Quiet.

891
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:19,267
<i>- No, you fu...
- Shh. Calmate, vato. Relax.</i>

892
01:03:19,346 --> 01:03:21,644
<i>Here, have some pisto.</i>

893
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:25,517
I'll see what I can do,
all right?

894
01:03:25,585 --> 01:03:28,213
- He says he'll take this price.
- Tell him I'm not negotiating.

895
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:31,883
<i>- The price is so low now, it's a steal.
- He'll probably pass.</i>

896
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:34,119
That'll be his loss.

897
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:48,367
Listen, Janis, I need a cash advance.
Can you help me?

898
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:50,409
I've already given you
three advances.

899
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:56,416
I need some money, Janis. What good is it
to have a show if I don't sell anything?

900
01:03:56,483 --> 01:04:01,284
Cruz, most of your paintings are already
spoken for by important collectors.

901
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:07,126
- What?
- You'll be completely sold out by the end of the night.

902
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,788
Sold out? All of it?

903
01:04:14,201 --> 01:04:16,396
Then why can't I get
some money tonight?

904
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:20,803
It doesn't work that way. The checks
go to the accountant to be processed.

905
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:24,810
No, I need some money now!
Do you understand me? Tonight.

906
01:04:26,046 --> 01:04:30,142
Come on. I sold out,
so I deserve some, right?

907
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:34,346
You've got a brilliant career
ahead of you, Cruz.

908
01:04:34,421 --> 01:04:37,151
<i>But all that talent can
go right in the garbage.</i>

909
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:39,988
Think about that when you're getting
high with your friends tonight.

910
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:44,588
Please, no Baptist sermons, okay,
Janis? Strictly business, remember?

911
01:04:53,573 --> 01:05:00,240
Thank you.

912
01:05:11,224 --> 01:05:13,522
You know, he really
is a genius, though.

913
01:05:13,593 --> 01:05:16,619
And the amazing thing... he's never even been...

914
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:20,063
Hey, Belinda, Belinda.

915
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:23,364
Here's my ticket.

916
01:05:23,436 --> 01:05:27,099
Belinda, you're too uptight.
Come on, this is my show.

917
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,336
Hey, hey.

918
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,344
I want to
present you my friends.

919
01:05:32,412 --> 01:05:36,644
- This is Lois and Jerry.
- Jared.

920
01:05:36,716 --> 01:05:38,650
You had a good time tonight, huh?

921
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:41,710
Hey, Cruzito!
Cruzito!

922
01:05:41,788 --> 01:05:44,279
Cruz!
Hey, homes, homes.

923
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:49,056
<i>Hey, you made me look
like a cholo, ese.</i>

924
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:14,953
- Daniel.
- Mm-hmm.

925
01:06:15,021 --> 01:06:17,114
Get them on their feet
and out the door.

926
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:20,785
Artists, folks.
Just artists being artists.

927
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,455
Drink up, enjoy yourselves.
We got art on the walls, on the floor.

928
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:28,831
This is a happening. We are going to
read about this tomorrow in the paper.

929
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:32,394
Let's celebrate
artistic freedom.

930
01:06:32,472 --> 01:06:35,441
You had all this planned, didn't you?
It's part of the exhibit.

931
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:37,806
<i>I got a hot tip, Al.
How's my credit?</i>

932
01:06:37,877 --> 01:06:40,243
<i>Ryder, your credit's
as tight and firm as...</i>

933
01:06:40,313 --> 01:06:42,838
Oh, come on.
Don't be that-a-way.

934
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,975
Nothin' like poppin'
a cherry, huh, Al?

935
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:47,178
Red Ryder, your mouth,
your mouth.

936
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,619
Lakers won in overtime, Al.

937
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:52,886
Oh! Give him a green one.
No, the other green one.

938
01:06:54,394 --> 01:06:57,522
Why do you keep bettin' on them
L.A. Teams, Lightning?

939
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:01,192
You just keep payin' up, Al, and
everything's gonna be just fine.

940
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:07,338
She looks a little
bowlegged to me, Al.

941
01:07:07,407 --> 01:07:09,341
You're gonna always
be runner-up, punk.

942
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:15,548
<i>I'm still gonna cut that
V.L. placa off of you, sissy.</i>

943
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:19,813
Hey, Pancho, don't be a sore loser.
Get the fuck outta here.

944
01:07:26,426 --> 01:07:29,327
I don't want that greaser pimp
even talkin' to you. Understand me?

945
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,168
<i>Tomorrow is your day, guero.</i>

946
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:38,568
Tonight, you must read
the black book.

947
01:07:45,412 --> 01:07:47,437
These are
the killing points.

948
01:07:47,514 --> 01:07:50,347
The arrows show
where a man can be killed.

949
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:53,045

01:21:53,459 --> 01:21:55,689
- We gotta get outta here, Cruzito!
- Juanito!

1106
01:21:55,761 --> 01:21:57,729
<i>- There's nothing
left! - Cruz! - ¡Chale!</i>

1107
01:21:57,796 --> 01:21:59,923
Please bring
my baby back. Please.

1108
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:04,163
There's nothing we can do! If we don't
get outta here, we're fucked!

1109
01:22:04,236 --> 01:22:06,830
Okay?
Come on, please.

1110
01:22:06,905 --> 01:22:09,135
- Juanito!
- Come on!

1111
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,641
<i>¡Ama!</i>

1112
01:22:12,044 --> 01:22:17,710
Please get up. You can do it.
Get up, Juanito. Get up!

1113
01:22:17,783 --> 01:22:19,717
Oh, God, no!

1114
01:22:19,887 --> 01:22:24,415
<i>The Lord is my shepherd,
There is nothing I shall want.</i>

1115
01:22:24,491 --> 01:22:28,393
<i>Fresh and green are the pastures
where He gives me repose,:</i>

1116
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:33,525
<i>Near restful waters He leads me
to revive my drooping spirit.</i>

1117
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,969
<i>Surely goodness and kindness shall
follow me all the days of my life,</i>

1118
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:40,336
<i>and in the Lord's own house
shall I dwell.</i>

1119
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:12,770
Let us begin. In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

1120
01:23:17,477 --> 01:23:19,570
<i>Apa.</i>

1121
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:22,945
<i>- This is a reading from the first letter ofJohn.
- Forgive me.</i>

1122
01:23:23,016 --> 01:23:26,645
<i>Perdoname, apa.</i>

1123
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:30,315
Not now!
Not ever!

1124
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:33,655
You are dead to me,
likeJuanito.

1125
01:23:38,298 --> 01:23:40,596
Let us pray.

1126
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:45,866
<i>LordJesus Christ, by Your own
three days in the tomb,</i>

1127
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:50,467
<i>You allowed the graves of all
who believe in You to be made holy,</i>

1128
01:23:50,544 --> 01:23:55,106
<i>so You made the grave a sign
of hope that promises resurrection,</i>

1129
01:23:55,182 --> 01:23:58,083
<i>even as it claims
our mortal bodies.</i>

1130
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:02,645
<i>Grant that our brother, Juanito,
may sleep here in peace...</i>

1131
01:24:02,723 --> 01:24:05,351
<i>until You awaken him
to glory.</i>

1132
01:24:05,425 --> 01:24:07,416
<i>Then he will see You
face to face,</i>

1133
01:24:07,494 --> 01:24:10,554
<i>and in Your light,
we shall see life...</i>

1134
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,723
<i>and know
the splendor of God,</i>

1135
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:16,257
<i>for You live
forever and ever. Amen.</i>

1136
01:24:21,942 --> 01:24:23,967
<i>It's okay, jefito.</i>

1137
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:26,535
<i>You can cry if you want.</i>

1138
01:24:39,493 --> 01:24:41,620
The Aryan Vanguard's
been insulted.

1139
01:24:41,695 --> 01:24:44,425
You spics knew Big Al had
an insurance policy with the A.V.

1140
01:24:44,498 --> 01:24:49,959
So when your little lamb strays from
the flock... I'm gonna kill the boy!

1141
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:54,035
I heard that.

1142
01:24:55,842 --> 01:24:57,833
<i>Al deserved to die.</i>

1143
01:24:57,911 --> 01:25:02,041
Besides, your AV-ers owed him
more money than anybody else.

1144
01:25:02,115 --> 01:25:04,083
So you made out fine.

1145
01:25:10,223 --> 01:25:12,191
He still dies.

1146
01:25:12,259 --> 01:25:16,457
The council has authorized me
to make a substantial cash offer...

1147
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:18,896
to assure nothing happens
to Miklo.

1148
01:25:18,965 --> 01:25:21,092
I'm listenin'.

1149
01:25:21,168 --> 01:25:25,434
Half of Al's cash.
$8,000.

1150
01:25:25,505 --> 01:25:27,769
<i>We're now open
for business.</i>

1151
01:25:27,841 --> 01:25:32,073
<i>We'll give you personally 25% of every
bet we collect from one of your members.</i>

1152
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,240
<i>You don't give me squat!</i>

1153
01:25:36,316 --> 01:25:39,979
<i>You don't even do business
unless I say you can.</i>

1154
01:25:40,053 --> 01:25:41,987
<i>You understand?</i>

1155
01:25:42,055 --> 01:25:43,989
So?

1156
01:25:46,126 --> 01:25:49,118
So, what are you givin'
on the Lakers-76ers?

1157
01:25:49,196 --> 01:25:52,222
<i>Give the puto four
on 76.</i>

1158
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:56,497
<i>The 76ers... and four points.</i>

1159
01:26:01,408 --> 01:26:03,467
Gimme the Lakers
for a hundred.

1160
01:26:03,543 --> 01:26:06,034
I'll take some of
that action myself.

1161
01:26:11,502 --> 01:26:14,401
<i>Miklo, if Onda's going
into business, carnal,</i>

1162
01:26:14,426 --> 01:26:16,424
<i>people have to know
they can trust us.</i>

1163
01:26:16,449 --> 01:26:18,926
<i>So treat everybody
the same.</i>

1164
01:26:19,098 --> 01:26:22,926
<i>The AV-ers control the dope and the
BGA-ers are trying to move in on them.</i>

1165
01:26:23,025 --> 01:26:25,391
<i>Let 'em fight it out
while we build our bank account.</i>

1166
01:26:26,274 --> 01:26:28,572
<i>We'll do business
with both of them.</i>

1167
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:33,297
<i>Money knows no color, carnal.
Everybody likes to gamble.</i>

1168
01:26:33,402 --> 01:26:36,269
<i>All right, all you little old
ladies! It's the milkman!</i>

1169
01:26:36,401 --> 01:26:39,131
Come on. It's time to collect
all that milk money!

1170
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:43,057
It's all I can do.
I'll give you a half a point.

1171
01:26:43,082 --> 01:26:46,017
- That's the point spread. Gotta be cool, bro.
- Be cool.

1172
01:26:46,085 --> 01:26:50,996
<i>Jefe, here's some produce, freshly
picked right outta the fields.</i>

1173
01:26:54,921 --> 01:27:00,553
<i>¡Ay! Christmastime! Pancho Villa,
Virgen de Guadalupe, gracias.</i>

1174
01:27:00,764 --> 01:27:06,361
<i>Huacha, from now on I want 40% of
everything we make set aside for legal fees.</i>

1175
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:09,165
<i>We gotta start helping
our gente get outta here.</i>

1176
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:11,799
<i>Use 20% for Christmas presents
for the carnales.</i>

1177
01:27:11,877 --> 01:27:14,402
You should be ashamed!
Quit looking at boobs.

1178
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,916
<i>Look at a boob tube, compliments
from El Mero Mero.</i>

1179
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:22,283
My B.G.A. Brothers! Pockets!
Gotta get rid of that natural look.

1180
01:27:22,354 --> 01:27:24,288
Go back
to processing.

1181
01:27:24,356 --> 01:27:27,553
- Look like me, vato, huh?
- Hey, how 'about those Raiders, chump?

1182
01:27:27,626 --> 01:27:29,754
Heh-heh!
B.G.A. Is always right.

1183
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:34,137
<i>Got a special sale for tomorrow
night's fight. It's gonna be two-for-one, bro.</i>

1184
01:27:34,279 --> 01:27:36,873
<i>Two for me
and one for you!</i>

1185
01:27:37,895 --> 01:27:43,027
<i>Hey, man, don't talk to me about credit.
I got debts as thick as a phone book.</i>

1186
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:46,543
<i>Now that Mosca and Flaco
are getting transferred to Chino,</i>

1187
01:27:46,568 --> 01:27:49,196
<i>we'll have a base close
to the courts in Los Angeles.</i>

1188
01:27:49,396 --> 01:27:53,560
<i>Give 'em some money so they can set up
a legal fund, recruit some soldiers.</i>

1189
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:55,846
<i>You got it, Jefe.</i>

1190
01:27:55,921 --> 01:27:59,357
Hey, milkweed.

1191
01:27:59,425 --> 01:28:04,348
My plan to join our business
and share profits, I like it, ese.

1192
01:28:04,673 --> 01:28:08,803
- I don't.
- Where you goin', ese?

1193
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,701
Hey, hey, hey, homes.
Hey, I'm sorry.

1194
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:17,157
<i>Hey, hey, mira. Look, uh, it's about
that little debt, you know?</i>

1195
01:28:17,309 --> 01:28:19,743
- Not so little.
- Hey, I'm booking next week, homes.

1196
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:22,524
I got my parole, you know?
I need my cash for the streets.

1197
01:28:22,564 --> 01:28:26,642
- It's hard to get set up out there, you know?
- Gotta pay part of it.

1198
01:28:27,111 --> 01:28:30,205
I can do better than that.
Put you on the council.

1199
01:28:30,656 --> 01:28:33,750
You could be one of the seven.
Motada's been wenting you in.

1200
01:28:33,826 --> 01:28:38,058
He needs my vote.
Erase my debt, and you're in.

1201
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,242
Okay, Popeye.

1202
01:28:45,306 --> 01:28:48,275
There'll be a blank space
next to your name in my book.

1203
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:51,423
I'll keep it up here
in my memory.

1204
01:28:54,017 --> 01:28:59,470
Orale, carnales. You'll be tied in good when
you get out. Whatever you want, just ask.

1205
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:09,459
<i>Come on. This is
my parole picture.</i>

1206
01:29:09,498 --> 01:29:12,037
Hey, you only get
paroled once.

1207
01:29:12,075 --> 01:29:14,543
Magic, something
to remember you by.

1208
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:17,531
All right, okay.
Here we are now.

1209
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:19,628
All right, vato,
take a picture.

1210
01:29:19,705 --> 01:29:21,983
Oh, come on.
Hey, I got people waiting.

1211
01:29:23,946 --> 01:29:26,346
<i>- Ready?
- Andale.</i>

1212
01:29:26,376 --> 01:29:29,072
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

1213
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:38,716
<i>You know, I grew up
about ten blocks from here,</i>

1214
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,384
<i>but this place
blows my mind, Carmen.</i>

1215
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:44,292
<i>Looks like
Hawaii, man.</i>

1216
01:29:44,362 --> 01:29:46,762
My father planted this
40 years ago.

1217
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,595
Created the whole
Yucatan right here.

1218
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,072
Carmen's the best chef
in all of East Los.

1219
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,301
- That right?
- Uh-huh.

1220
01:30:01,112 --> 01:30:03,342
Suck on this
licorice stick.

1221
01:30:05,517 --> 01:30:11,353
It's been dipped 20 times
to make you hump all night long, Paco.

1222
01:30:11,423 --> 01:30:16,360
<i>With you two around, I ain't gonna need
no marriage counselor. ¿Que no?</i>

1223
01:30:21,032 --> 01:30:23,466
<i>I like your style, Paquito.</i>

1224
01:30:23,535 --> 01:30:27,437
I'll check it out. I know this shit is
good, 'cause like the last batch you made,

1225
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:30,030
<i>was dynamite, man.</i>

1226
01:30:30,108 --> 01:30:34,670
But the only trip is, I'm wondering if you
could supply the quantity that I'll need.

1227
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:38,113
- See, um...
- First the money...

1228
01:30:39,918 --> 01:30:43,081
then the honey.

1229
01:30:44,456 --> 01:30:47,857
All right, look.
You see my homey out there?

1230
01:30:51,329 --> 01:30:53,889
You got nine more grand.

1231
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:58,668
Now show me yours.

1232
01:31:03,008 --> 01:31:04,999
<i>Get him a caja.</i>

1233
01:31:07,912 --> 01:31:11,439
- Okay.
- Make sure not to shake the baby food.

1234
01:31:17,155 --> 01:31:22,218
PCP is very explosive.

1235
01:31:23,628 --> 01:31:26,756
Boom!

1236
01:31:26,831 --> 01:31:29,595
I'd hate to lose
such a handsome customer.

1237
01:31:29,668 --> 01:31:31,898
Ooh, mami.

1238
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:33,995
That feels good.

1239
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:41,478
I might need it
for later.

1240
01:31:43,982 --> 01:31:49,215
<i>So did you really make this stuff? You a chemist?</i>

1241
01:31:49,287 --> 01:31:54,156
<i>I worked in
a medical lab. Simon.</i>

1242
01:31:54,225 --> 01:31:58,525
Hey, baby... have you
ever had a threesome?

1243
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:02,362
Hey, baby, let's take care
of the deal first, okay?

1244
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:05,267
What's the matter?
Too much for you?

1245
01:32:05,336 --> 01:32:08,203
No, I just like business
before pleasure.

1246
01:32:10,175 --> 01:32:14,271
- He's a fucking cop!
- Rollie, get in here now!

1247
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:18,805
Get him!

1248
01:32:18,883 --> 01:32:21,647
<i>You son-of-a-bitch!</i>

1249
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:26,015
No!

1250
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:34,662
<i>No!</i>

1251
01:32:34,733 --> 01:32:37,827
<i>- ¡Pinche perro!
- Aaah!</i>

1252
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:40,598
<i>You killed my baby!
My baby!</i>

1253
01:32:40,672 --> 01:32:43,539
<i>- It's PCP! Don't breathe!
- Get this shit off me!</i>

1254
01:32:43,608 --> 01:32:46,475
Oh, shit! We gotta get you
to the hospital! No, no, no!

1255
01:32:46,544 --> 01:32:49,069
Get me a hose! We're gonna wash
this stuff off! Don't breathe!

1256
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,809
<i>It's a bust, ese.</i>

1257
01:32:51,883 --> 01:32:55,410
Goddamn it! We lost the fuckin' lab
and Clavo's money!

1258
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,682
<i>That pinche
loan shark's gonna shit!</i>

1259
01:32:57,756 --> 01:33:00,418
<i>How we gonna
pay him back now?</i>

1260
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,960
<i>- We lost everything.
- ¡Mira, mira! There's Carmen, eh.</i>

1261
01:33:03,027 --> 01:33:04,892
Come on, man,
turn around.

1262
01:33:04,963 --> 01:33:07,864
Who's that? Hey, she's
signalling someone, man!

1263
01:33:07,932 --> 01:33:10,366
<i>Paco, come back here!
We gotta wash that stuff off you!</i>

1264
01:33:10,435 --> 01:33:12,869
- Draw in the perimeter!
- Wilson, call it in!

1265
01:33:12,937 --> 01:33:15,371
Police!
Stop the car!

1266
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,375
<i>Pull over
the fucking car!</i>

1267
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:22,770
Stop the car!

1268
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,042
<i>Put your hands on the steering wheel!
Get your hands up!</i>

1269
01:33:25,116 --> 01:33:26,549
Let's go.
Outta the car.

1270
01:33:26,618 --> 01:33:29,052
Careful, careful,
we're taxpayers, Officer McCann.

1271
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,351
- You turn around.
- You two, outta the car!

1272
01:33:32,423 --> 01:33:35,085
<i>Orale, that's a nice placa
you got there, ese.</i>

1273
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,628
<i>You should be riding with me,
not fucking with me, carnal.</i>

1274
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:40,357
<i>Don't you call me carnal, you
piece of shit. I'm not your brother.</i>

1275
01:33:40,431 --> 01:33:42,991
<i>Scumbags like you
are killing off our kids.</i>

1276
01:33:43,067 --> 01:33:46,503
You should get some clothes on, officer,
before you get arrested for indecent exposure.

1277
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:49,301
- What an example to set for the kids.
- Listen, motherfuckin' rat punk.

1278
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:53,743
<i>I'm gonna put you and your rat clica
back in the joint. You keep talkin'!</i>

1279
01:33:53,812 --> 01:33:56,372
All right, all right,
Paco, let's go.

1280
01:33:56,447 --> 01:33:58,005
- Check the trunk.
- Put some clothes on.

1281
01:33:58,082 --> 01:34:00,846
- You got a warrant?
- Check that trunk!

1282
01:34:00,919 --> 01:34:03,979
- What do you think you are, bulletproof? Check the trunk.
- Goddamn it, check it, Rollie.

1283
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:11,092
<i>So? You think I never
seen an O.D. Before?</i>

1284
01:34:11,162 --> 01:34:14,063
What's the matter?
You don't recognize your own son?

1285
01:34:14,132 --> 01:34:16,100
Hey, fuck you.
That ain't Hector.

1286
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:19,330
No, Hector's only 11.
That boy's 13.

1287
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:25,001
If your boss Savedra keeps manufacturing
that shit, it'll put Hector in a cemetery too.

1288
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:30,241
<i>¿Sabes que, homes? You may grow that
long hair and try to act like a vato,</i>

1289
01:34:30,315 --> 01:34:33,876
<i>- but you still smell like chorizo, pig!
- This pig...</i>

1290
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:35,886
is the only thing standing
between you and them,

1291
01:34:35,954 --> 01:34:37,785
but you ain't gonna
get through me, punk.

1292
01:34:37,856 --> 01:34:41,348
- Smokey, don't say nothing!
- Get him out of here, Rollie!

1293
01:34:44,195 --> 01:34:48,029
Your boss is a punk. He's gonna throw
you out with yesterday's coffee grounds.

1294
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:52,900
<i>- I ain't no rata.
- Yeah, you're a rat.</i>

1295
01:34:52,971 --> 01:34:55,166
Get up! Go!

1296
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,435
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1297
01:34:57,508 --> 01:35:00,443
<i>I believe my time here in this institution
has turned me completely around,</i>

1298
01:35:00,511 --> 01:35:02,502
<i>and I'm very grateful.</i>

1299
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:05,515
<i>Now I think I can make it as
a productive member of society.</i>

1300
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:10,111
Mr. Velka, isn't it true
that you clique with La Onda,

1301
01:35:10,188 --> 01:35:13,021
a group whose motto is:
"Blood in, blood out,"

1302
01:35:13,091 --> 01:35:16,083
meaning you have to kill someone
in order to become a member?

1303
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:19,152
I hung out with a group who are
my friends from my old neighborhood.

1304
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:24,099
Our reputation grew out of defense of each
other. That's a... That's it, nothing more.

1305
01:35:24,168 --> 01:35:27,604
<i>They didn't even listen!
They fucked me!</i>

1306
01:35:27,672 --> 01:35:31,403
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Miklo,
and make something of your life.

1307
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,502
<i>I don't ever wanna see you
in here again. ¿Me entiendes?</i>

1308
01:35:37,382 --> 01:35:39,475
This is my daughter.
Look at her.

1309
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:44,214
Look at her! She was only
six months old when I came here.

1310
01:35:44,289 --> 01:35:46,917
She grew up without me.
I don't even know her.

1311
01:35:49,627 --> 01:35:54,087
<i>- That ain't right, carnal.
- No, it's not, but it's that way for too many of us.</i>

1312
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,360
That's why your parole
is so important.

1313
01:35:56,434 --> 01:35:58,698
You've gotta prove
there's another way.

1314
01:36:01,406 --> 01:36:04,034
You got a chance
to do it, I don't.

1315
01:36:04,108 --> 01:36:06,099
<i>Right on, carnal.</i>

1316
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,145
Right on.

1317
01:36:14,452 --> 01:36:16,317
Thank you.

1318
01:36:16,387 --> 01:36:19,618
<i>You gotta start acting like
somebody who deserves parole, carnal.</i>

1319
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:23,183
<i>Put it on the record.
Earn your freedom on paper, ese.</i>

1320
01:36:23,261 --> 01:36:26,458
<i>All they got in front of them
is your jacket.</i>

1321
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:30,968
<i>You are your jacket, 'cause to them,
you're just a number.</i>

1322
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:34,835
<i>Everyone who enters the joint thinks he's
a man, but you know what he really is?</i>

1323
01:36:34,906 --> 01:36:37,932
<i>A number,
worth 30 grand a year.</i>

1324
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:40,500
<i>They want us
to come back.</i>

1325
01:36:40,578 --> 01:36:43,411
<i>And what's worse, they have us
lining up to get in, ese.</i>

1326
01:36:43,481 --> 01:36:45,881
<i>We gotta turn
the system around.</i>

1327
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:47,941
<i>We gotta
outthink them.</i>

1328
01:36:48,019 --> 01:36:52,046
<i>Now concentrate.
Why do you deserve parole, Mr. Velka?</i>

1329
01:36:52,123 --> 01:36:55,718
<i>Sir, I been in prison
almost a third of my life.</i>

1330
01:36:55,793 --> 01:36:58,853
I've grown up here. I've
learned to read and write here.

1331
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:00,898
I earned my G.E.D.

1332
01:37:00,965 --> 01:37:05,026
Mr. Velka,
this board's only concern...

1333
01:37:05,103 --> 01:37:07,765
is to find evidence
of your rehabilitation.

1334
01:37:07,839 --> 01:37:10,069
<i>- That's all.
- Sir, with all due respect,</i>

1335
01:37:10,141 --> 01:37:12,075
look at my record.

1336
01:37:12,143 --> 01:37:15,977
I've worked hard to prove I deserve another
chance. It's in there in black and white.

1337
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:18,845
Please give me
another chance.

1338
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:31,452
<i>- ¿Que paso?
- I got it! I got my parole!</i>

1339
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:41,798
Magic!

1340
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,132
They're gonna throw
a parade for me in Hollywood.

1341
01:37:45,209 --> 01:37:49,805
Hey, vato, the only parade they're
gonna throw for you is on Halloween.

1342
01:38:10,402 --> 01:38:13,269
<i>¡Simon que si!</i>

1343
01:38:13,338 --> 01:38:15,238
Damn, ese, they're
not that good, homes.

1344
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:18,400
That's the best thing I've
tasted in nine years, vato loco.

1345
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:22,242
<i>Orale.</i>

1346
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:25,749
<i>- Good to be home, carnal.
- Right on, cacheton. Right on.</i>

1347
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:28,285
<i>Cuidado, Cruzito.</i>

1348
01:38:28,353 --> 01:38:30,344
That rose won't bloom
in the spring.

1349
01:38:30,422 --> 01:38:33,585
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No
Baptist sermons, okay, homey?

1350
01:38:34,959 --> 01:38:37,189
Takes away the pain
in my back.

1351
01:38:37,262 --> 01:38:40,459
The Lord can't.
I tried praying.

1352
01:38:40,532 --> 01:38:44,559
- You better still be painting.
- You know it, homes. You know it.

1353
01:38:44,636 --> 01:38:46,831
But it's different
than before.

1354
01:38:48,173 --> 01:38:51,074
More real.

1355
01:39:02,287 --> 01:39:05,222
<i>No, hombre.
Famous apartments?</i>

1356
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:07,258
They ain't famous
no more, ese.

1357
01:39:07,325 --> 01:39:09,657
<i>Orale, come stay with me, homes.
I got a studio.</i>

1358
01:39:09,727 --> 01:39:12,093
Nah, I gotta stay here.
Frank got me a place.

1359
01:39:12,163 --> 01:39:14,631
And besides, the parole board
checks my address.

1360
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:17,862
<i>- Simon.
- Thanks, Cruzito.</i>

1361
01:39:17,936 --> 01:39:20,769
<i>Anytime, carnal,
tu sabes.</i>

1362
01:39:23,341 --> 01:39:25,309
You don't know how good
it is to see you, vato.

1363
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:28,641
<i>Vato Loco forever, carnal.</i>

1364
01:39:32,951 --> 01:39:35,215
<i>Nobody home!</i>

1365
01:39:40,925 --> 01:39:43,155
<i>What the fuck's
up with you?</i>

1366
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:48,029
- Oh, milkweed.
- I made it.

1367
01:39:53,938 --> 01:39:56,338
<i>Entra.</i>

1368
01:39:56,407 --> 01:40:00,275
Hey, welcome to
the barrio, homes.

1369
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:04,181
Hey, Smokey!

1370
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:07,548
<i>Apache!
Mudo!</i>

1371
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,246
Hey, homes.

1372
01:40:13,324 --> 01:40:16,452
Yeah, Carlos. Yeah, he told me
to tell your mom to send more coffee.

1373
01:40:16,528 --> 01:40:18,894
And make sure
it's, um, T.C.

1374
01:40:18,963 --> 01:40:21,193
Shit, she never
sent me nothin'.

1375
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:29,404
Chata, some coffee!

1376
01:40:31,976 --> 01:40:35,104
Ay.
She's fucked up.

1377
01:40:35,179 --> 01:40:37,807
We had a party last night, ese.

1378
01:40:39,984 --> 01:40:43,010
So, uh, you got a place
for me in this building, huh?

1379
01:40:43,087 --> 01:40:45,681
<i>Uh...</i>

1380
01:40:48,026 --> 01:40:51,120
Hey, you know, that
didn't work out, homes.

1381
01:40:51,195 --> 01:40:54,164
This whole fuckin' building
is filled up.

1382
01:40:54,232 --> 01:40:56,496
So what am I gonna tell
my parole officer?

1383
01:40:56,568 --> 01:40:59,901
<i>Hey... tell him
to suck his pipi.</i>

1384
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:03,236
<i>Simon, ese.</i>

1385
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:05,367
<i>You can stay here, ese.</i>

1386
01:41:05,443 --> 01:41:07,775
It's the same address.

1387
01:41:07,845 --> 01:41:11,303
- I even got you a good job.
- You're supposed to have an apartment for me!

1388
01:41:11,382 --> 01:41:13,782
Hey, just a fuckin' minute,
Your Majesty!

1389
01:41:13,851 --> 01:41:16,081
This ain't the joint
with three hots and a cot!

1390
01:41:16,154 --> 01:41:18,918
This is the streets, homey.
You got no choice!

1391
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:22,926
<i>The parole board calls the shots here! This
is your address for at least three months!</i>

1392
01:41:31,636 --> 01:41:34,104
<i>¡Chinga! La Onda
could do better than this!</i>

1393
01:41:34,172 --> 01:41:36,606
<i>Yeah, Rico and Luis
split after a month, man.</i>

1394
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:39,541
I'm just hanging
for my old lady and my kid.

1395
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:43,911
<i>- What about Popeye?
- Popeye's docking me for a third of my check, man.</i>

1396
01:41:43,982 --> 01:41:46,883
Everybody's getting clipped,
man, to pay that loan shark, Clavo.

1397
01:41:46,951 --> 01:41:49,419
<i>That's the dude that fronted the bread
for the PCPIab.</i>

1398
01:41:49,487 --> 01:41:51,455
That's not the way
it's supposed to be!

1399
01:41:55,593 --> 01:41:58,426
<i>Son las once treinta y siete
y seguimos escuchando...</i>

1400
01:41:58,496 --> 01:42:02,057
<i>Io mas romantico
de nuestra musica.</i>

1401
01:42:02,133 --> 01:42:04,363
- I burnt you on that one.
- Truck's loaded. Can I get my check?

1402
01:42:04,435 --> 01:42:06,699
No, Larry. No, no.
Don't be that way.

1403
01:42:06,771 --> 01:42:09,706
Larry, pettiness
is an ugly thing.

1404
01:42:09,774 --> 01:42:13,801
Won't be able to cash that 'til Monday.
Company'll do it for ten bucks.

1405
01:42:14,979 --> 01:42:16,970
- All right.
- So, Larry,

1406
01:42:17,048 --> 01:42:19,949
what do you give me
on the Lakers and Golden State?

1407
01:42:20,018 --> 01:42:22,248
Three points?

1408
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,880
Come on, Larry.
Kareem is crippled.

1409
01:42:24,956 --> 01:42:28,448
Gimme six points
and Golden State. Come on.

1410
01:42:28,526 --> 01:42:30,960
What?

1411
01:42:31,029 --> 01:42:34,465
Barry's hand's hurt.
He's Golden State's whole offense.

1412
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:38,659
Hang on, Larry.
So?

1413
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:40,931
Kareem is injured.
So's Nixon.

1414
01:42:41,005 --> 01:42:44,236
Lakers got lots of firepower, but
without Barry, Golden State's nothin'.

1415
01:42:44,308 --> 01:42:46,367
<i>Six points
ain't enough.</i>

1416
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,913
Listen.
Six points or no bet.

1417
01:42:53,985 --> 01:42:55,976
Sorry, Larry.
Sorry, Larry.

1418
01:42:57,422 --> 01:43:02,155
All right.
Who made you the expert?

1419
01:43:02,226 --> 01:43:04,786
<i>Put me down
for 1,200.</i>

1420
01:43:04,862 --> 01:43:08,161
Yeah, 1,200, Larry.

1421
01:43:10,868 --> 01:43:13,098
<i>Chingao, East Los
has gotten really crowded.</i>

1422
01:43:13,171 --> 01:43:16,629
<i>It is, man. Illegals
pouring in from everywhere, homes.</i>

1423
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:21,645
<i>Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Panama.
Donde sea, homes.</i>

1424
01:43:21,713 --> 01:43:25,274
Crossroads of the world, ese.
A Latino world.

1425
01:43:25,349 --> 01:43:27,715
<i>- Simon, ese.
- You seen Paco?</i>

1426
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,946
- What?
- You seen Paco?

1427
01:43:30,021 --> 01:43:32,148
No, not since
Juanito died.

1428
01:43:32,223 --> 01:43:34,953
They don't wanna keep the wound
open, man. They don't want me around.

1429
01:43:35,026 --> 01:43:37,324
<i>That's cold-blooded,
carnal.</i>

1430
01:43:37,395 --> 01:43:41,058
Paco's a narc, homes.
Probably bust my ass someday.

1431
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:43,464
Man, that's fucked up!

1432
01:43:45,871 --> 01:43:47,964
<i>Detective Aguilar.</i>

1433
01:43:48,039 --> 01:43:51,566
Detective! Big time!

1434
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:54,440
<i>- ¿Qu'iubo, champ?
- Miklo?</i>

1435
01:43:54,512 --> 01:43:57,208
- Good guess.
- Oh, man, are you out?

1436
01:43:57,281 --> 01:44:00,307
- Yeah, two weeks.
- Well, why didn't you let me know, man?

1437
01:44:00,384 --> 01:44:03,979
Hey, after nine years in the joint,
it ain't easy to call a cop, ese.

1438
01:44:04,055 --> 01:44:08,651
Listen. It's not me I'm calling
about anyway. It's Cruz.

1439
01:44:08,726 --> 01:44:12,457
<i>He's hurtin', man.
He needs his familia.</i>

1440
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:18,196
- He has no family.
- That ain't right, Paco. Vatos Locos forever, remember?

1441
01:44:18,269 --> 01:44:22,137
No, you know what I remember? The day they
lowered my little brother into the ground.

1442
01:44:22,206 --> 01:44:25,505
That changed me forever.

1443
01:44:25,576 --> 01:44:27,567
Every time I see a junkie
on the street...

1444
01:44:27,645 --> 01:44:30,273
it reminds me how Cruzito pissed
away his life and his talent.

1445
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:34,341
- Yeah, well, think about it. I gotta get back to work.
- Hey, hey, carnal.

1446
01:44:34,418 --> 01:44:39,117
How you doing, man?
Anything I can do to help?

1447
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:43,251
Nah. If I'm gonna make it outta here,
it's gonna be me who does it.

1448
01:44:43,327 --> 01:44:48,959
<i>And I really want to, carnal. There's lots
of chances to go the other way, believe me.</i>

1449
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:54,903
<i>- But I'm gonna make it, Paco.
- Well, that's great, carnal. That's... That's great.</i>

1450
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:08,077
I need the keys
to move the trucks.

1451
01:45:08,152 --> 01:45:12,589
Wait a minute. Make sure all the tires
are out of'em and they're washed down.

1452
01:45:14,458 --> 01:45:18,019
So you know your hoops.

1453
01:45:20,031 --> 01:45:21,931
<i>Oye, cholos, alla arriba.</i>

1454
01:45:21,999 --> 01:45:24,968
<i>Eh, cortense sus pedos
alla arriba.</i>

1455
01:45:25,036 --> 01:45:28,164
<i>¡Oye, tu! Dile a tus camaradas
que llamare a la policia.</i>

1456
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:30,173
What the fuck?

1457
01:45:33,611 --> 01:45:37,513
<i>Hey, guero.
Fuck the world.</i>

1458
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:49,057
Would you please get outta my bed?
I gotta go to sleep.

1459
01:45:49,126 --> 01:45:51,060
Later, ese.

1460
01:45:51,128 --> 01:45:53,756
Get the fuck outta my bed! I gotta
go to work in the morning, man!

1461
01:45:53,831 --> 01:45:56,527
<i>- What the fuck you on, ese?
- Hey, relax!</i>

1462
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,865
- What's up with you?
- That's my space, man! That's all I have!

1463
01:46:03,574 --> 01:46:06,543
<i>Aaah!
You pinche mamon!</i>

1464
01:46:12,116 --> 01:46:14,812
<i>Hey, Gil, there's been some
sorta mistake on my check.</i>

1465
01:46:14,885 --> 01:46:18,821
I'm $150 short. I worked 20 hours
overtime last week.

1466
01:46:18,889 --> 01:46:23,121
That's right. I'm gonna do you a favor
and take 150 out seven more times...

1467
01:46:23,194 --> 01:46:25,526
'til you pay back
the money you stole.

1468
01:46:25,596 --> 01:46:29,532
What? I been totally straight with
you, man. What are you talkin' about?

1469
01:46:31,035 --> 01:46:34,664
You know, I try
to give you cons a break.

1470
01:46:34,739 --> 01:46:37,401
You see money and you
can't resist stealing it.

1471
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:40,535
That's a lie, man! I never stole
from you, Gil! It wasn't me!

1472
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:43,375
You had the keys.
You knew where the money was.

1473
01:46:43,447 --> 01:46:46,177
What?

1474
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:48,912
<i>I didn't...
I didn't do anything.</i>

1475
01:46:50,387 --> 01:46:52,378
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1476
01:46:53,924 --> 01:46:57,052
150 times eight is 1,200.

1477
01:46:57,128 --> 01:46:59,255
<i>Right?</i>

1478
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:01,662
Right?

1479
01:47:01,732 --> 01:47:05,930
You use my money to pay back
your gambling debts? Huh?

1480
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:08,597
That's a cute story.

1481
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,970
Tell you what.
I'm gonna call the cops.

1482
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:15,705
I'll tell 'em my version, and
you can tell 'em yours, convict.

1483
01:47:28,759 --> 01:47:34,129
<i>Hey. I'll get you
some extra overtime.</i>

1484
01:47:36,167 --> 01:47:38,795
Yeah, right.

1485
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:42,236
So much for the straight world!
Fucker's got me by the balls!

1486
01:47:42,306 --> 01:47:44,968
He can call my parole officer
anytime and get me revoked.

1487
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:48,068
<i>No Ilores, vato. This is just
to get you on your feet, ese.</i>

1488
01:47:48,145 --> 01:47:50,670
<i>- You know, later on you'll get something better, tu sabes.
- Yeah, right.</i>

1489
01:47:50,748 --> 01:47:54,548
Maybe I can join the priesthood and get
some of that tax-free Sunday money, huh?

1490
01:47:54,618 --> 01:47:56,984
Ah, I was doin' better
than this in the joint.

1491
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:59,579
- This just ain't worth it, ese.
- Don't bother, milkweed.

1492
01:47:59,657 --> 01:48:02,490
<i>There's no respect.
Oye, open up!</i>

1493
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,552
<i>- ¿Quien es?
- Ronald Reagan, asshole. Open up.</i>

1494
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:11,667
<i>- Who the fuck are you, pendejo?
- Who the fuck are you? I live here, pinche huey!</i>

1495
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,669
My house!

1496
01:48:21,612 --> 01:48:26,311
<i>Hey, hey, hey, it's cool,
it's cool. He's crashing here.</i>

1497
01:48:26,383 --> 01:48:29,216
<i>Entrale. Tu tambien.</i>

1498
01:48:29,454 --> 01:48:31,422
<i>Oye, Popeye. I told you
no artillery in this place.</i>

1499
01:48:31,489 --> 01:48:34,219
<i>- You wanna get these people outta here now?
- Go change a tire, guero.</i>

1500
01:48:34,292 --> 01:48:36,658
<i>We're talking some
heavy business here.</i>

1501
01:48:36,727 --> 01:48:39,560
<i>You ain't gonna make no deals in this
place. You're gonna fuck up my parole.</i>

1502
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:43,327
- Come on, let's go.
- No, Cruzito, this is my house, damn it!

1503
01:48:43,401 --> 01:48:45,961
Cruzito.

1504
01:48:46,037 --> 01:48:49,529
Hey, Cruz.
Where you been, ese?

1505
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:52,633
<i>Hey, Clavo.
¿Que paso, homes?</i>

1506
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:54,871
Man, you a tough mama
to find.

1507
01:48:54,946 --> 01:48:57,471
Where are those little four G's
that you owe me?

1508
01:49:00,017 --> 01:49:03,453
Oh, look, homes. I just gotta sell
a couple of my paintings, ese.

1509
01:49:06,224 --> 01:49:09,591
<i>Paintings, that's right. At least you
gave me some paintings, ese.</i>

1510
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:13,790
<i>This baboso still hasn't given me dick.
Can you believe that?</i>

1511
01:49:13,864 --> 01:49:19,166
<i>What about the 30% you been cutting out
of the carnales checks at the retread shop?</i>

1512
01:49:19,237 --> 01:49:22,434
That's not what Onda's about.
I ain't payin' you shit!

1513
01:49:22,506 --> 01:49:25,441
<i>Shut the fuck up, guero!
I represent Onda here!</i>

1514
01:49:25,509 --> 01:49:27,739
You represent yourself.
You always did.

1515
01:49:27,812 --> 01:49:29,780
Hey, Popeye,
you been collecting?

1516
01:49:29,847 --> 01:49:32,975
<i>- What about our share, homes?
- Fuck, Popi, me too!</i>

1517
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:35,575
- You told me you were broke.
- You told me you were fuckin' broke!

1518
01:49:35,653 --> 01:49:38,747
I don't come here to listen to you
chumps whine about nickels and dimes.

1519
01:49:38,823 --> 01:49:40,882
<i>I'm talkin'about coppin'
a hundred grand.</i>

1520
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:43,791
<i>In Nueva York, I mean, shit,
that wakes people up.</i>

1521
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:46,625
Anybody got
a problem with that?

1522
01:49:46,697 --> 01:49:50,098
- Heh-heh, no, no. We got no problem with
that, ese. - Then what's the bullshit?

1523
01:49:51,168 --> 01:49:54,035
I'll do it.
We'll do it.

1524
01:49:54,105 --> 01:49:57,871
I got... I got Mudo out on the street
right now. He's coppin' some wheels.

1525
01:49:57,942 --> 01:50:00,467
<i>And, uh... and, uh,
we got the muscle.</i>

1526
01:50:00,544 --> 01:50:03,308
You just give us the plan.

1527
01:50:03,381 --> 01:50:05,713
You got the muscle
to jack yourself off.

1528
01:50:05,783 --> 01:50:08,251
<i>That's it.</i>

1529
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:10,719
You better watch your back,
Mr. Retread Man!

1530
01:50:10,788 --> 01:50:12,722
I'm gonna put you in
fuckin' high heels again!

1531
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:16,282
Go ahead and make your move, motherfucker!
I'll send you to hell with Big Al!

1532
01:50:22,767 --> 01:50:26,931
Ah... I ain't got
no time to waste on you.

1533
01:50:27,004 --> 01:50:29,165
Wolf ticket's chump.

1534
01:50:31,142 --> 01:50:33,440
You're right, kid.

1535
01:50:33,511 --> 01:50:37,504
This chump can't even
change his socks.

1536
01:50:37,581 --> 01:50:40,744
<i>He can't,
but I can.</i>

1537
01:50:40,818 --> 01:50:42,945
Hey, Clavo.
Hey, hey, wait a second.

1538
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:45,488
What's the scam?

1539
01:50:45,556 --> 01:50:50,118
I need a triggerman, white boy,
not someone who just punches a clock.

1540
01:50:50,194 --> 01:50:52,628
<i>- You wanna see who I am? Huh?
- ¡Calmala!</i>

1541
01:50:52,697 --> 01:50:55,131
<i>- ¡Calmala, calmala!
- I don't give warning shots, cabron!</i>

1542
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:57,599
We can do the money truck,
or we can off each other.

1543
01:51:00,171 --> 01:51:02,105
M- M-Miklo,
don't fuck around, ese.

1544
01:51:02,173 --> 01:51:05,165
Realthing.

1545
01:51:06,944 --> 01:51:08,969
<i>Miklo, this vato's big trouble!</i>

1546
01:51:09,046 --> 01:51:13,142
<i>- ¡Callate!
- You bluff in this game, gabacho, you better be holding five aces.</i>

1547
01:51:13,217 --> 01:51:16,015
In the joint, I was hustling more money
than that punk ever dreamed of.

1548
01:51:16,087 --> 01:51:18,555
He was punchin' my time clock
every day. What's the gig?

1549
01:51:18,622 --> 01:51:24,185
<i>- ¡Aguila! ¡Aguila!
- The armored truck at the Zody's Saturday night. Lotta cash.</i>

1550
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:28,027
Popeye cleans his debt
and gets ten percent.

1551
01:51:28,099 --> 01:51:31,432
<i>¡Chale! Armored truck's a dumb deal.
It's too dangerous.</i>

1552
01:51:33,104 --> 01:51:35,334
Not this one,
smart boy.

1553
01:51:35,406 --> 01:51:38,000
The driver's in on it.
He's a customer.

1554
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,044
Okay, we'll do it.

1555
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:49,917
But it's fifty-fifty, and
you wipe out Cruz's debt.

1556
01:51:49,987 --> 01:51:54,651
<i>¡Chale, homes! Don't get fucked up in
this bullshit! Stay straight, pendejo!</i>

1557
01:51:54,725 --> 01:51:56,693
No sermons, ese,
remember?

1558
01:51:58,329 --> 01:52:00,354
This is who I am.

1559
01:52:02,366 --> 01:52:07,326
So, do we gift wrap this sucker for you,
or do you walk away empty-handed?

1560
01:52:08,839 --> 01:52:12,866
Sixty-forty. Realthing
handles the cash.

1561
01:52:12,943 --> 01:52:17,039
You come up with the guns and the car.
Apache's drivin'.

1562
01:52:17,114 --> 01:52:20,550
<i>Me and Smokes will
back up Realthing.</i>

1563
01:52:20,618 --> 01:52:24,884
- Okay. I can deal with that.
- You're gonna have to.

1564
01:52:24,955 --> 01:52:28,948
Hey, hey, hey!
What about me, fucker?

1565
01:52:29,026 --> 01:52:30,755
You're out of it,
asshole!

1566
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:34,628
<i>It's payback time,
Popeye.</i>

1567
01:52:34,698 --> 01:52:38,065
I'm gonna take back
my rent money, with interest.

1568
01:52:41,071 --> 01:52:44,063
<i>Orale. Let's have
a drink, ese.</i>

1569
01:52:50,498 --> 01:52:54,229
Detective Aguilar?
Delivery from El Tepeyac?

1570
01:52:54,302 --> 01:52:56,236
- I got you, man. I got you.
- No way.

1571
01:52:56,304 --> 01:52:58,329
- Once... I did. I did so.
- No way, man. I knew it was you.

1572
01:52:58,406 --> 01:53:00,636
Check this out. Check this out.
"Manuel's Special."

1573
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:03,074
Is this a nuclear accident
burrito or what?

1574
01:53:03,144 --> 01:53:07,581
- Something to tide us over 'til lunch.
- Us? You mean you. Two of you.

1575
01:53:07,648 --> 01:53:09,843
Hey, I'm an undercover cop, all right?

1576
01:53:09,917 --> 01:53:12,909
- I'm working on my character look.
- You're a fat undercover cop.

1577
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:16,479
<i>Does this look real or fake?
Real, right? McCann.</i>

1578
01:53:16,557 --> 01:53:20,550
<i>Oye, narco. You like
busting dope dealers?</i>

1579
01:53:20,628 --> 01:53:23,426
<i>Oye, pendejo.
This is my lunch hour.</i>

1580
01:53:23,498 --> 01:53:28,936
- Big deal going down tomorrow, the Zody's on Whittier.
- Who is this?

1581
01:53:29,003 --> 01:53:33,235
Look for a blue Econoline van
with 20 kis of coke inside.

1582
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:35,673
You'll be on
the six o'clock news.

1583
01:53:35,743 --> 01:53:38,007
Oh, yeah.
Who is this?

1584
01:53:40,081 --> 01:53:42,015
<i>All I gotta say is,
shit goes down...</i>

1585
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:45,018
<i>and we're sittin'here without backup,
we're gonna be two sorry assholes.</i>

1586
01:53:45,086 --> 01:53:47,782
<i>How many times we done this
and nothing's happened, huh?</i>

1587
01:53:47,855 --> 01:53:50,323
A lot. Relax.
H- Have a doughnut.

1588
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:52,382
I already have one.

1589
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,519
Have another doughnut.
Look at these.

1590
01:53:54,595 --> 01:53:56,859
What a dick.

1591
01:53:56,931 --> 01:53:58,865
Dick and asshole.
That's all you call me.

1592
01:53:58,933 --> 01:54:01,094
What is my name?
Dick Asshole?

1593
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:03,261
<i>Hey, hey.
Blue Econoline van.</i>

1594
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:05,168
<i>- Is that your guy?
- I don't know.</i>

1595
01:54:10,144 --> 01:54:14,137
- Do you see a connection anywhere?
- No.

1596
01:54:14,215 --> 01:54:16,877
<i>Looks like
two Latino males in front.</i>

1597
01:54:16,951 --> 01:54:18,885
<i>Some more in back.
I don't know how many.</i>

1598
01:54:18,953 --> 01:54:21,012
<i>That's a lot of people
for a dope deal.</i>

1599
01:54:21,088 --> 01:54:23,022
<i>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</i>

1600
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:26,184
<i>Shit! They're rippin'off the connection!
They're gonna take the money and the dope!</i>

1601
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:28,023
<i>No, there's
an armored truck!</i>

1602
01:54:28,095 --> 01:54:30,188
This ain't a buy.
This is a heist! Call it in!

1603
01:54:30,264 --> 01:54:33,631
- 211 in progress, Zody's on Whittier.
- Look up!

1604
01:54:33,701 --> 01:54:35,692
<i>Look up!</i>

1605
01:54:39,073 --> 01:54:41,337
Come on!

1606
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:55,521
<i>Smokey, I got you covered!
Let's go!</i>

1607
01:55:01,429 --> 01:55:03,897
Shit! Apache, cover me!

1608
01:55:06,467 --> 01:55:08,799
<i>Apache, wait!</i>

1609
01:55:09,737 --> 01:55:11,728
Shit!

1610
01:55:14,609 --> 01:55:17,669
They're headin' south on Whittier!
There's two of'em!

1611
01:55:17,745 --> 01:55:19,679
- Call it in!
- Roger!

1612
01:55:58,386 --> 01:56:02,948
<i>- It's me, carnal!
- Miklo? What the fuck are you doing, man?</i>

1613
01:56:04,325 --> 01:56:07,055
<i>- Gimme the gun, carnal.
- No fuckin' way, ese!</i>

1614
01:56:07,128 --> 01:56:09,426
Miklo, I can help you.
Gimme the fuckin' gun!

1615
01:56:09,497 --> 01:56:12,864
I ain't goin' back, Paco!
You owe me this one, vato loco!

1616
01:56:14,268 --> 01:56:17,260
No! Miklo, wait!
I can't!

1617
01:56:17,338 --> 01:56:19,772
- Stop! Police!
- Fuck you, detective!

1618
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,035
Stop or I'll shoot!

1619
01:58:06,598 --> 01:58:09,692
<i>Hey... Cruz, man.</i>

1620
01:58:09,768 --> 01:58:12,760
When you gonna finish
messin' with that shit, homes?

1621
01:58:12,837 --> 01:58:17,865
<i>Huh? You painted it
about 20 times.</i>

1622
01:58:17,942 --> 01:58:19,910
<i>Hey, come on,
tecato.</i>

1623
01:58:19,978 --> 01:58:24,381
<i>- Let's ride the horse.
- Chale, Chuey. We got an intruder.</i>

1624
01:58:24,449 --> 01:58:26,747
Oh, shit, homes.

1625
01:58:28,686 --> 01:58:30,677
It's John Wayne.

1626
01:58:30,755 --> 01:58:35,089
<i>Uh, well, you're
just a bunch of little chavalas...</i>

1627
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:39,187
<i>and I can whip the whole bunch
of ya chicanos.</i>

1628
01:58:39,264 --> 01:58:41,232
So what you want, man?

1629
01:58:44,269 --> 01:58:46,396
<i>Not much, carnalito.</i>

1630
01:58:46,471 --> 01:58:49,565
Uh, "Hey, how are you?
How you doin'?"

1631
01:58:49,641 --> 01:58:53,077
<i>- You know, things people usually say who care about each other.
- Oh, si.</i>

1632
01:58:53,144 --> 01:58:57,080
After seven years
of nothing, man?

1633
01:58:57,148 --> 01:58:59,139
Not even
a fucking greeting card.

1634
01:58:59,217 --> 01:59:01,708
<i>You want hospitality, homes?
Hey, pues...</i>

1635
01:59:01,786 --> 01:59:03,981
<i>There's a can of
chinga tu madre...</i>

1636
01:59:04,055 --> 01:59:05,784
<i>on the table, man.</i>

1637
01:59:05,857 --> 01:59:08,485
- Why don't you help yourself.
- Hey, homes?

1638
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,825
Did you say "Hey, homes" to Miklo,
homes, before you shot him?

1639
01:59:11,896 --> 01:59:15,332
- Hey, chill out, Chuey!
- He was a shooter in a robbery. I was doing my job.

1640
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,630
<i>Nobody has the right
to kill innocent people.</i>

1641
01:59:17,702 --> 01:59:21,399
<i>No, you're a pinche
vato vendido, puto!</i>

1642
01:59:21,472 --> 01:59:23,997
<i>- Fucker!
- Hey! ¡Calmala!</i>

1643
01:59:24,075 --> 01:59:27,203
- Hey, fuckin' relax!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

1644
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:31,744
Fuck you!
Fuck you, wimp!

1645
01:59:31,816 --> 01:59:35,775
Hey, homes, you can't come here anymore
unless you're gonna bust me!

1646
01:59:35,854 --> 01:59:38,584
Who the fuck gave you permission to use
my little brother in your paintings?

1647
01:59:38,656 --> 01:59:41,250
<i>I don't need permission from you.
He's my carnalito too!</i>

1648
01:59:41,326 --> 01:59:45,854
Don't you useJuanito as an excuse to
wreck your life. You don't have that right!

1649
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,191
<i>Si, culero.</i>

1650
01:59:51,269 --> 01:59:54,500
I don't have the right, huh?
Fuckin' right I don't.

1651
01:59:54,572 --> 01:59:57,097
You're fuckin' right
I don't have the right.

1652
01:59:57,175 --> 02:00:00,201
<i>I don't... I don't have
that fuckin'right.</i>

1653
02:00:00,278 --> 02:00:03,338
<i>You want him outta my painting, joto?
All right.</i>

1654
02:00:03,414 --> 02:00:07,373
<i>All right. There he is!
¡Ahi esta! ¡Toma!</i>

1655
02:00:07,452 --> 02:00:09,477
Take it, man!
Come on!

1656
02:00:09,554 --> 02:00:12,114
Juanito always loved me
more than you, homes.

1657
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:16,820
<i>¡Tu te creias muy chingon! You were always
too much of a badass to love the little vato!</i>

1658
02:00:16,895 --> 02:00:20,490
Just like you are now. So much of a
fucking badass you kill your own people!

1659
02:00:20,565 --> 02:00:23,227
No!

1660
02:00:23,301 --> 02:00:26,532
Don't you ever say that to me again,
Cruzito. I let you say that once...

1661
02:00:26,604 --> 02:00:28,629
<i>¿Que, puto?
What the fuck?</i>

1662
02:00:28,706 --> 02:00:32,506
<i>You gonna kick my ass?
Well, ¡caiga! Let's get down.</i>

1663
02:00:32,577 --> 02:00:36,479
- Come on! You the badass!
- I don't wanna fight with you, little brother.

1664
02:00:36,547 --> 02:00:41,075
<i>To what, bust me? Well, come on,
gabacho. You the law. Do your job.</i>

1665
02:00:42,754 --> 02:00:44,915
Do your fucking job!

1666
02:01:14,519 --> 02:01:17,079
Look at this.

1667
02:01:17,155 --> 02:01:19,123
Look at that.

1668
02:01:20,124 --> 02:01:22,251
Must be
from Quentin, huh?

1669
02:01:24,595 --> 02:01:28,554
- Hey. Hey, he's the guy...
- PCP bust. That's Popeye Savedra.

1670
02:01:28,633 --> 02:01:31,295
Miklo's connected to him.

1671
02:01:31,369 --> 02:01:34,031
<i>"La Onda a toda madre
o un desmadre."</i>

1672
02:01:34,105 --> 02:01:36,096
<i>What's "Onda"?</i>

1673
02:01:36,174 --> 02:01:38,369
<i>No, La Onda.
It's your destiny, man.</i>

1674
02:01:38,443 --> 02:01:41,037
It's... It's like a wave
nothing can stop.

1675
02:01:41,112 --> 02:01:43,080
Uh, "madre" means mother.
So...

1676
02:01:43,147 --> 02:01:45,138
No, no, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1677
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:48,049
<i>This is some heavy shit,
all right? "A toda madre".</i>

1678
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:50,417
<i>Everything is perfect.
It's like...</i>

1679
02:01:50,488 --> 02:01:52,513
your mother's love.

1680
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:54,558
<i>And "un desmadre"...</i>

1681
02:01:55,994 --> 02:01:58,121
is like you have no mother.

1682
02:01:58,196 --> 02:02:00,391
It's absolute hatred.
Complete destruction.

1683
02:02:00,465 --> 02:02:03,366
<i>In other words, you win it all
or lose everything.</i>

1684
02:02:03,434 --> 02:02:05,902
Sweet bunch of guys.

1685
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:09,804
This big fat pig, Popeye, right here in
the center? He's gotta be their leader.

1686
02:02:09,874 --> 02:02:13,002
<i>- Hey, Aguilar?
- Look at the way they're all grouped around him.</i>

1687
02:02:13,077 --> 02:02:17,741
Hey, Aguilar, that con you
blasted just got outta surgery.

1688
02:02:17,815 --> 02:02:20,784
He's gonna be a whole lot
easier to catch from now on.

1689
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,634
<i>Nurse, could you
give me a minute, please?</i>

1690
02:02:37,702 --> 02:02:39,670
Nurse?

1691
02:02:46,243 --> 02:02:49,610
<i>Por la Virgen, Miklo,
I did not know that it would...</i>

1692
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:53,480
<i>Don't talk to me about the Virgen.
Vatos Locos forever.</i>

1693
02:02:53,551 --> 02:02:56,748
That all died when you
pulled the trigger.

1694
02:03:04,929 --> 02:03:07,955
How did everything
get so fucked up, man?

1695
02:03:08,032 --> 02:03:10,296
<i>The pinche badge, ese.</i>

1696
02:03:12,169 --> 02:03:14,660
<i>You owe me, vendido!</i>

1697
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,167
Who's the sellout?

1698
02:03:18,242 --> 02:03:20,369
You're tellin' me you're
workin' hard, goin' straight.

1699
02:03:20,444 --> 02:03:22,605
The next thing I know,
you're pointin' a.357 at me...

1700
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:25,410
and there's two guys
dead on the ground.

1701
02:03:25,483 --> 02:03:29,010
I would have given you
anything, Miklo.

1702
02:03:29,086 --> 02:03:32,351
But you can't just
take away what I am.

1703
02:03:34,125 --> 02:03:36,889
You chose
the wrong side, ese.

1704
02:03:36,961 --> 02:03:40,021
There's too many of us.
You're gonna lose.

1705
02:03:40,097 --> 02:03:43,328
No, uh-uh. I don't forget
where I come from or who I am.

1706
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,834
That's what keeps me goin'
every day.

1707
02:03:47,338 --> 02:03:51,365
- You don't wanna hear the truth, Paco.
- What truth?

1708
02:03:51,442 --> 02:03:53,967
This? La Onda.
Is this your truth?

1709
02:03:54,044 --> 02:03:57,207
<i>Two-bit punks like Popeye Savedra
with their PCPIabs?</i>

1710
02:03:57,281 --> 02:04:01,581
Or you, robbing Zody's
and killing innocent people?

1711
02:04:01,652 --> 02:04:03,745
If that's your truth, then you're
right. I don't wanna hear it.

1712
02:04:03,821 --> 02:04:06,984
<i>Get out, puto!
You're not my blood!</i>

1713
02:04:08,325 --> 02:04:10,793
I'm cutting you off
like they did my leg.

1714
02:04:12,963 --> 02:04:15,363
You don't exist
for me anymore.

1715
02:04:31,382 --> 02:04:35,079
<i>Miklo!
Orale, carnalito. What's up, ese?</i>

1716
02:04:35,152 --> 02:04:37,086
<i>You're looking good,
homey.</i>

1717
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:52,562
<i>Hey, Hopalong!</i>

1718
02:04:52,636 --> 02:04:56,231
You better tell Carlos he better
stop fucking with my business!

1719
02:04:56,307 --> 02:04:58,571
Pockets,
not in public!

1720
02:04:58,642 --> 02:05:01,338
<i>I ain't gonna let
no junkie rip-off my customers!</i>

1721
02:05:01,412 --> 02:05:03,346
<i>Velka, time to lock up!</i>

1722
02:05:03,414 --> 02:05:06,178
<i>Mira, mira.
It's the Bionic Man.</i>

1723
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:08,184
<i>Hey, Carlos,
what's with the B.G.A.?</i>

1724
02:05:08,252 --> 02:05:10,982
Pay no mind to cheap conversation.
They're just sore losers, ese.

1725
02:05:11,055 --> 02:05:14,684
- They're just flapping their crow wings.
- Pockets is on the warpath.

1726
02:05:14,758 --> 02:05:18,125
I can't help it if the customers
know where the quality is.

1727
02:05:18,195 --> 02:05:20,129
He's been selling 'em
baby powder.

1728
02:05:20,197 --> 02:05:22,995
I don't have all day, man.
Let's take it in.

1729
02:05:23,067 --> 02:05:26,002
Hey, Majito.
Gonna be cellies, huh?

1730
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:28,561
<i>- Orale.
- Move over here. Let me get these cuffs.</i>

1731
02:05:30,374 --> 02:05:33,309
<i>¡Orale! That's
a badass pano, homeboy.</i>

1732
02:05:33,377 --> 02:05:35,436
You been burnin'
them quills, huh?

1733
02:05:35,512 --> 02:05:38,504
- You're getting good.
- It's yours.

1734
02:05:41,852 --> 02:05:44,013
My "Home Sweet Home"
picture, huh?

1735
02:05:45,189 --> 02:05:47,282
At least this bum leg
got me something.

1736
02:05:47,358 --> 02:05:49,918
I get to work
at the law library.

1737
02:05:49,994 --> 02:05:53,293
What's all that mad-dogging
between Carlos and the B.G.A.?

1738
02:05:53,364 --> 02:05:56,162
The vato's got one
sweet cocaine connection.

1739
02:05:56,233 --> 02:05:59,669
Hmm. And he's moving in
on Pockets' customers.

1740
02:05:59,737 --> 02:06:02,171
How did he connect?

1741
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:06,232
Nobody knows. But it's dynamite shit.
Pure Bolivian flake.

1742
02:06:06,310 --> 02:06:08,744
And Montana, he just stood by
and watched Carlos jump in?

1743
02:06:08,812 --> 02:06:11,440
<i>Plata talks.</i>

1744
02:06:11,515 --> 02:06:14,006
Carlos is recruiting
lots of soldiers...

1745
02:06:14,084 --> 02:06:17,576
and buying influence on the council
to try to neutralize Montana.

1746
02:06:17,655 --> 02:06:20,089
Says it's his own personal trip,
not Onda's!

1747
02:06:20,157 --> 02:06:24,218
That's bullshit! Personal trips
is what's fucking Onda up!

1748
02:06:24,295 --> 02:06:26,559
I saw that out on the streets.

1749
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:29,360
We're cutting
our own throats.

1750
02:06:33,804 --> 02:06:35,897
<i>It's too soon
to be walking on it.</i>

1751
02:06:35,973 --> 02:06:37,941
It's a long way up.

1752
02:06:38,008 --> 02:06:41,671
But there's no way they're gonna stick
me down there on the first tier without...

1753
02:06:41,745 --> 02:06:43,940
<i>ah, my carnales.</i>

1754
02:06:44,014 --> 02:06:46,073
Ah!

1755
02:06:47,518 --> 02:06:49,452
Your own cousin did that.

1756
02:06:51,588 --> 02:06:54,148
<i>- We should put a hit on that puto.
- No, he's mine.</i>

1757
02:06:54,224 --> 02:06:57,352
His payback's
gonna take time.

1758
02:06:57,428 --> 02:07:01,626
I'm gonna make him sorry
he ever fucked with my business.

1759
02:07:01,699 --> 02:07:03,690
<i>Hey, puto.</i>

1760
02:07:03,767 --> 02:07:05,735
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, chorizo?

1761
02:07:05,803 --> 02:07:07,794
Trying to jump-start
your memory, punk.

1762
02:07:07,871 --> 02:07:10,499
Turn your ass around.
Where the fuck is Popeye Savedra?

1763
02:07:10,574 --> 02:07:12,542
I ain't seen the vato.
He took off.

1764
02:07:12,609 --> 02:07:14,577
Yeah? Right after
Zody's, right?

1765
02:07:14,645 --> 02:07:16,977
You were in on that too,
weren't you, Smokey?

1766
02:07:17,047 --> 02:07:21,279
<i>- How 'bout these putos? You know 'em, don't you?
- No. No way.</i>

1767
02:07:21,352 --> 02:07:25,083
La Onda? Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1768
02:07:25,155 --> 02:07:27,146
Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1769
02:07:27,224 --> 02:07:29,454
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about, ese.

1770
02:07:29,526 --> 02:07:31,653
<i>I'll tell you what
I'm talking about, pendejo.</i>

1771
02:07:31,729 --> 02:07:34,721
You're a two-time loser, Smokey. One
more, they're gonna lock you up for good.

1772
02:07:34,798 --> 02:07:37,528
So you better tell me about Onda, or
I'm gonna strap you down with a bitch.

1773
02:07:37,601 --> 02:07:39,728
You'll never see
the streets again!

1774
02:07:39,803 --> 02:07:44,206
If I say anything, I'm dead meat.
I ain't gonna tell you shit, ese!

1775
02:07:54,885 --> 02:07:58,582
<i>It's baby powder, baboso!</i>

1776
02:07:58,655 --> 02:08:00,714
You write down
every word I say.

1777
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:05,558
Anything you don't understand, you ask.
I will answer just once, so write it down.

1778
02:08:05,629 --> 02:08:09,429
Precedents for habeas corpus,
cruel and unusual punishment here.

1779
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:11,934
You're also allowed to help
on Durham decree.

1780
02:08:12,002 --> 02:08:14,163
How much can you
charge for this?

1781
02:08:14,238 --> 02:08:16,763
You gotta know what you're
talkin' about first.

1782
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:19,274
You do your homework,
jailhouse lawyer...

1783
02:08:19,343 --> 02:08:22,403
can make as much as
any mid-level attorney on the street.

1784
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:24,606
I'm gonna live
in here.

1785
02:08:26,016 --> 02:08:29,952
- Jerry, I don't mean to be nosy, but I...
- Then don't be.

1786
02:08:32,056 --> 02:08:34,786
All right, what?
What is it?

1787
02:08:34,858 --> 02:08:37,452
I'm just
wonderin', uh...

1788
02:08:37,528 --> 02:08:39,962
You own all those
hardware stores.

1789
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:42,396
How come
you're in here?

1790
02:08:43,767 --> 02:08:46,827
Eleven tons of Colombian weed,
twelve keys of heroin...

1791
02:08:46,904 --> 02:08:49,702
and a pilot that turned
state's evidence.

1792
02:08:50,741 --> 02:08:54,768
<i>¡Chingao! Big time.</i>

1793
02:08:54,845 --> 02:08:57,507
- Hey, Jer, I just want you to handle my ca...
- Hurry up, Jerry.

1794
02:08:57,581 --> 02:09:00,482
Charlie. I didn't see your jacket here.
You got an appointment?

1795
02:09:00,551 --> 02:09:03,076
<i>The name's Carlos. Remember, I'm
paying you lot of feria, ese.</i>

1796
02:09:03,153 --> 02:09:05,644
- Make an appointment, Charlie.
- You should be working on my case overtime.

1797
02:09:05,722 --> 02:09:09,180
Charlie, cool out or get out.
George? Table.

1798
02:09:11,495 --> 02:09:17,263
<i>Oye, Miklo. You could take your leg off and
hook down some of the books from up top, ese.</i>

1799
02:09:17,334 --> 02:09:22,328
<i>Hey, I'm just kidding, ese.
Come here. Oye, come here, man.</i>

1800
02:09:22,406 --> 02:09:27,036
<i>Hey, relax. I got the medicine
to make you well, vato. Mira.</i>

1801
02:09:27,111 --> 02:09:30,672
<i>If you're ever in any pain, homey, you
just come talk to me. ¿Me entiendes?</i>

1802
02:09:32,816 --> 02:09:34,784
<i>- You should talk to El Mero Mero.
- Chale.</i>

1803
02:09:34,852 --> 02:09:38,344
Think about the future, not the past.
Montana's not God.

1804
02:09:38,589 --> 02:09:42,355
<i>Tomorrow at the council I'm giving
Onda a chance to move into the driver's seat.</i>

1805
02:09:42,425 --> 02:09:44,552
<i>Don't be
left behind, eh?</i>

1806
02:09:44,627 --> 02:09:48,461
<i>Mira. I cut a sweet deal
with the AV-ers.</i>

1807
02:09:48,531 --> 02:09:51,329
<i>They'll supply me
with all the dope I can move...</i>

1808
02:09:51,401 --> 02:09:54,234
just as long as I sell
only to the blacks and the browns.

1809
02:09:55,605 --> 02:09:59,837
What do you have to give
in return to the polar bears?

1810
02:10:01,577 --> 02:10:04,205
I gotta plug up
the B.G.A. Pipeline.

1811
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:06,214
Take 'em outta
the dope business.

1812
02:10:08,918 --> 02:10:13,378
<i>It's simple. Me and my soldados
can take care of Pockets in here.</i>

1813
02:10:13,456 --> 02:10:16,914
<i>My brother Smokey can take out Cheap
Times, their main supply joint in L.A.</i>

1814
02:10:16,993 --> 02:10:20,019
All I need from the council
is backup.

1815
02:10:20,096 --> 02:10:25,295
- In return, I'm prepared to give Onda a third of my profit.
- It's a sucker's deal, ese.

1816
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:31,402
The only thing the Aryans want is
to start a war between black and brown.

1817
02:10:31,474 --> 02:10:33,465
<i>Chale. We've got
a truce with the B.G.A.</i>

1818
02:10:33,543 --> 02:10:36,842
<i>Why do you wanna play
the chimp with these mayates?</i>

1819
02:10:36,913 --> 02:10:39,381
The market is there.

1820
02:10:39,449 --> 02:10:42,612
Cocaine is America's
cup of coffee.

1821
02:10:45,054 --> 02:10:47,614
<i>Oye, check it out.</i>

1822
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:49,624
<i>I'm making so much feria
right now,</i>

1823
02:10:49,692 --> 02:10:52,855
it's making Miklo's gambling book
look like bubble gum change!

1824
02:10:52,929 --> 02:10:56,126
We don't start wars
to become dope pushers.

1825
02:10:56,199 --> 02:10:58,895
<i>You even addicted some of
our own soldados to coca.</i>

1826
02:10:58,968 --> 02:11:03,462
We're supposed to protect
our people, not destroy them.

1827
02:11:03,539 --> 02:11:07,066
Look at his arms. He loves
that shit more than he loves us.

1828
02:11:07,143 --> 02:11:10,704
<i>- He'll destroy La Onda.
- ¡Ya! Enough words.</i>

1829
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:14,876
We've come all this way. You wanna
go back to bumming cigarettes, ese?

1830
02:11:14,951 --> 02:11:18,409
<i>- Oye, you wanna shine shoes?
- Ese, La Onda don't shine shoes.</i>

1831
02:11:18,488 --> 02:11:21,480
That's right, but that's what's gonna
happen if we don't make our move now.

1832
02:11:21,557 --> 02:11:25,118
I wanna own the whole fuckin' store!
Now are you with me?

1833
02:11:25,194 --> 02:11:28,322
<i>I say chale.
You're not the leader here.</i>

1834
02:11:28,398 --> 02:11:30,298
<i>I say Onda's
not with you.</i>

1835
02:11:30,366 --> 02:11:32,459
You do what you
have to do without us.

1836
02:11:42,378 --> 02:11:45,313
'Cause I ain't goin' back.

1837
02:11:46,983 --> 02:11:49,281
I don't need Onda for this.

1838
02:11:49,891 --> 02:11:52,753
Money buys my backup.

1839
02:11:53,181 --> 02:11:56,241
I'll get the polar bears
to back my play.

1840
02:11:58,629 --> 02:12:00,871
<i>- Oye, ¿adonde vas, Jose?
- I split, eh.</i>

1841
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:03,379
<i>- Hey, carnal.
- No, ese.</i>

1842
02:12:07,511 --> 02:12:10,902
<i>Carlos, come back!
Jefe, we can't let him go.</i>

1843
02:12:10,943 --> 02:12:13,871
We can't let him
split up Onda. Carlos!

1844
02:12:14,364 --> 02:12:17,137
<i>Can't you see Montana's
stupid for letting Charlie walk?</i>

1845
02:12:17,162 --> 02:12:18,762
<i>- Onda's committing suicide.</i>

1846
02:12:18,787 --> 02:12:21,715
- Fuck you, Jerry!
- Fine. I thought you wanted to learn something.

1847
02:12:24,621 --> 02:12:26,453
Listen, Charlie's
a businessman.

1848
02:12:26,478 --> 02:12:28,188
He broke some serious
business rules.

1849
02:12:28,213 --> 02:12:30,443
Not only did he get strung out
on his own shit,

1850
02:12:30,927 --> 02:12:33,657
but he moved on B.G.A. Clients
when he didn't have to.

1851
02:12:33,730 --> 02:12:35,664
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1852
02:12:35,732 --> 02:12:38,496
I see the jackets of most
of the cons that come in here.

1853
02:12:38,568 --> 02:12:41,469
Eighty percent of them...
eighty percent of them are drug cases.

1854
02:12:41,537 --> 02:12:44,062
You know why?
Because everybody out there's doin' it.

1855
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:46,199
Doctors, lawyers,
housewives.

1856
02:12:46,276 --> 02:12:48,710
Cocaine is
America's cup of coffee.

1857
02:12:53,416 --> 02:12:55,680
You were Carlos' connection.

1858
02:12:55,751 --> 02:13:00,552
<i>He said the same "cup of coffee"line
exactly. You were supplying him.</i>

1859
02:13:00,623 --> 02:13:03,615
<i>You're pissed 'cause he's
doing business with AV-ers now.</i>

1860
02:13:03,693 --> 02:13:07,151
Last year, California passed
a flat-time law for drug offenders.

1861
02:13:07,229 --> 02:13:09,754
You know what that means? That means
they have it worse than anybody...

1862
02:13:09,832 --> 02:13:11,823
murderers, rapists,
anybody.

1863
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:14,199
There's no parole,
no good time.

1864
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:18,400
That's a lot of guys that are gonna be
here for a real long time, all drug users.

1865
02:13:18,474 --> 02:13:20,408
Can you see
the potential?

1866
02:13:20,476 --> 02:13:22,177
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1867
02:13:22,202 --> 02:13:24,261
Anyone who can accommodate
that appetite...

1868
02:13:24,328 --> 02:13:27,786
can control this joint
and every other joint.

1869
02:13:28,037 --> 02:13:30,075
Dwell on it.

1870
02:13:37,393 --> 02:13:40,226
Drive it.
Drive it, Ryder.

1871
02:13:40,251 --> 02:13:42,583
Here's your pill briefs.

1872
02:13:42,608 --> 02:13:45,533
Jerry said it will take at least
three months for the court to respond.

1873
02:13:45,558 --> 02:13:48,083
Well, well, well,
Lightning.

1874
02:13:48,204 --> 02:13:52,501
<i>Our favorite spic lover has come home.
I knew he'd be back.</i>

1875
02:13:52,526 --> 02:13:57,897
Here's your file. Magic said to remind you
about Lightning's account. It's overdue.

1876
02:13:58,333 --> 02:14:02,929
You hear that, Lightning? The cripple
here wants to collect your gambling debts.

1877
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:07,783
Yeah, well, I might think about it,
if he'll show me his falsie.

1878
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:10,888
Come on, cripple,
show me your stump.

1879
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:15,130
<i>Little white Mexican boy came all
the way back just to show us his stump.</i>

1880
02:14:15,352 --> 02:14:19,110
- Hold his fuckin' leg! Come on. Stand still.
- Get off me, motherfuckers!

1881
02:14:19,178 --> 02:14:22,079
Too many britches on.
Stay still, goddamn it, I said!

1882
02:14:22,104 --> 02:14:24,334
You gotta be crazy to pull
this shit, Lightning!

1883
02:14:24,407 --> 02:14:26,341
Ooh, I'm scared, punk.

1884
02:14:26,409 --> 02:14:29,242
<i>I'll bet you didn't fight so hard when
Big Al used to do this, did you?</i>

1885
02:14:29,311 --> 02:14:31,176
He must be laughin'
in his grave, cripple.

1886
02:14:31,247 --> 02:14:33,841
Get off, you fuck...
No, leave it alone!

1887
02:14:33,916 --> 02:14:36,749
Stay still,
goddamn it.

1888
02:14:36,819 --> 02:14:41,279
<i>- Oh! There she is.
- Fucking puto!</i>

1889
02:14:41,357 --> 02:14:44,986
You ever heard that old saying,
"Put your foot in your mouth"?

1890
02:14:46,929 --> 02:14:49,591
Spit-shine that shoe, boy.

1891
02:14:51,701 --> 02:14:55,694
You fuckin' polar bears are gonna pay, believe me!

1892
02:14:55,771 --> 02:14:59,366
Look around you, half-breed.
Onda's finished!

1893
02:14:59,442 --> 02:15:01,376
Carlos works for us now,

1894
02:15:01,444 --> 02:15:04,038
and every day he brings
more Onda soldiers with him.

1895
02:15:04,113 --> 02:15:07,310
You greasers better wise up.
It's a white world.

1896
02:15:07,383 --> 02:15:10,045
<i>The coloreds are here
to serve us.</i>

1897
02:15:10,119 --> 02:15:13,885
From now on, you're gonna be
my personal errand boy.

1898
02:15:15,324 --> 02:15:18,316
- You motherfucker!
- Fuckin' punk!

1899
02:15:18,394 --> 02:15:21,886
Go out for a pass, cripple.
Come on, go deep.

1900
02:15:30,539 --> 02:15:32,871
Now you're back to
your true nature, boy.

1901
02:15:32,942 --> 02:15:36,639
<i>Crawling on your belly like a worm.</i>

1902
02:15:37,947 --> 02:15:39,881
They put it in my face!

1903
02:15:39,949 --> 02:15:43,851
You have to understand. Your leg is gone,
Miklo. You can no longer be a soldier.

1904
02:15:43,919 --> 02:15:45,853
That's why I put you
in the library.

1905
02:15:45,921 --> 02:15:48,947
It's not what they did to me.
They got no respect for Onda.

1906
02:15:49,024 --> 02:15:51,015
We should never have
given up Carlos.

1907
02:15:51,093 --> 02:15:55,393
You think I wanted to?
Carlos fucked up, bad!

1908
02:15:55,464 --> 02:15:58,331
I'm not saying he didn't,
but he was right about the drugs.

1909
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,368
Whoever controls them
controls everything.

1910
02:16:00,436 --> 02:16:03,371
You ever seen an old drug dealer,
Miklo? They don't exist.

1911
02:16:03,439 --> 02:16:05,703
Look, all we have
to do is wait.

1912
02:16:05,774 --> 02:16:09,210
<i>In five years, Chicanos are gonna be the
majority in the pintas in the Southwest.</i>

1913
02:16:09,278 --> 02:16:11,405
This is now,
not five years from now!

1914
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:15,439
What good is it if we're a bunch of fuckin'
slaves workin' for the B.G.A. And AV-ers?

1915
02:16:15,517 --> 02:16:17,542
We gotta attack now!
We gotta take power!

1916
02:16:17,620 --> 02:16:20,316
All we ever been doing is fighting
each other! And for what?

1917
02:16:20,389 --> 02:16:22,380
The best of us ending up
in pools of blood...

1918
02:16:22,458 --> 02:16:24,756
<i>for a pinche pack of smokes
and a snort of coca!</i>

1919
02:16:24,827 --> 02:16:27,227
<i>¡Chale!</i>

1920
02:16:27,296 --> 02:16:30,231
I don't know where
you're comin' from, bro.

1921
02:16:35,604 --> 02:16:37,663
<i>¿Que es eso?</i>

1922
02:16:39,341 --> 02:16:44,540
A Chicana from Cal State got them
to publish my essay on prison reform.

1923
02:16:46,081 --> 02:16:50,040
They want me to write a book
on the Chicano in prison.

1924
02:16:53,656 --> 02:16:56,591
<i>You better lift your eyes
outta this book, Jefe.</i>

1925
02:16:56,659 --> 02:16:59,389
You better see what's
goin' on around us now.

1926
02:17:05,234 --> 02:17:09,694
<i>Wind it up, gentlemen. Take it
to your houses. Let's go, move it.</i>

1927
02:17:09,772 --> 02:17:11,865
<i>Hey, Bonafide! When's
the B.G.A. Gonna take care of its tab?</i>

1928
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:14,101
<i>No can do, carnal.</i>

1929
02:17:16,378 --> 02:17:18,346
Quarter of the bill
I can take care of, maybe.

1930
02:17:18,414 --> 02:17:20,712
<i>Indugu. You forgot
your comb, man.</i>

1931
02:17:22,317 --> 02:17:24,342
Maybe.

1932
02:17:26,088 --> 02:17:28,921
Thinks he's getting away with something.
He's holding on to a fairy tale.

1933
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:32,085
<i>- ¡Pinche mayate!
- Hey, Magic.</i>

1934
02:17:32,161 --> 02:17:34,129
<i>Help me out.</i>

1935
02:17:47,242 --> 02:17:49,733
<i>You mad-dog me,
you better watch your back, homes!</i>

1936
02:17:49,812 --> 02:17:53,043
Now the fuckin' AV-ers
won't pay on their bets either.

1937
02:17:53,115 --> 02:17:57,108
Why pay? They were testing us
with Carlos and we folded.

1938
02:17:57,186 --> 02:17:59,211
Now they're gonna take us
apart piece by piece.

1939
02:18:04,259 --> 02:18:07,592
Whether we like it or not, the dope
business is where it's at, Magic.

1940
02:18:07,663 --> 02:18:12,600
If the AV-ers and the BGA-ers control
it, they control everything, including us.

1941
02:18:12,668 --> 02:18:15,237
Fuckin' A, ese.
Carlitos was right.

1942
02:18:15,262 --> 02:18:18,862
No, he was stupid...
for sellin' out to the AV-ers.

1943
02:18:22,644 --> 02:18:26,580
Onda should take the money left
in the gambling book and make a buy.

1944
02:18:27,191 --> 02:18:29,125
Yeah.

1945
02:18:29,150 --> 02:18:31,414
I know a connection.

1946
02:18:31,705 --> 02:18:37,473
- But the council won't approve it.
- We should do it anyway.

1947
02:18:40,262 --> 02:18:43,595
- You wanna die, ese?
- If I have to, I will!

1948
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:48,692
I lost my fucking leg,
my family back home.

1949
02:18:48,717 --> 02:18:50,685
This is all I got left.

1950
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:54,578
If we don't do something now,
Onda dies. Do you want that?

1951
02:19:01,450 --> 02:19:05,181
Magic.
I love Montana too.

1952
02:19:05,254 --> 02:19:08,553
But I'm not gonna stand by
and watch them destroy us.

1953
02:19:13,495 --> 02:19:15,429
<i>Will you stand with me,
carnal?</i>

1954
02:19:29,345 --> 02:19:31,336
<i>Right now there's
only two of us,</i>

1955
02:19:31,413 --> 02:19:33,438
<i>so we gotta lay back
and wait for an opening.</i>

1956
02:19:33,516 --> 02:19:38,647
<i>The Aryan Vanguard's gonna force Carlos
to make his move soon on the B.G.A.</i>

1957
02:19:38,721 --> 02:19:40,689
<i>His first target
will be Pockets.</i>

1958
02:19:40,756 --> 02:19:44,021
I told you to stop
branchin', punk!

1959
02:19:45,628 --> 02:19:48,461
Better watch your back
'cause I'm gonna ride you.

1960
02:19:48,531 --> 02:19:52,661
<i>Orale, ese. You're right.
I don't want any trouble.</i>

1961
02:19:52,735 --> 02:19:55,829
I've changed my ways.

1962
02:20:01,644 --> 02:20:04,511
Now I'm takin'
all your customers.

1963
02:20:06,115 --> 02:20:08,811
Say anything
and you're dead!

1964
02:20:08,884 --> 02:20:11,478
<i>At the same time
he hits Pockets,</i>

1965
02:20:11,554 --> 02:20:16,890
<i>his brother Smokey will move on Cheap
Times, the B.G.A. 's drugstore down in L.A.</i>

1966
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:20,291
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

1967
02:20:23,474 --> 02:20:25,965
<i>♪ She's a super freak
Super freak</i>

1968
02:20:26,013 --> 02:20:27,742
<i>She's su...</i>

1969
02:20:28,821 --> 02:20:31,834
Brought you monkeys
some coconuts...

1970
02:20:31,899 --> 02:20:34,697
from Quentin!

1971
02:20:47,456 --> 02:20:51,119
<i>The only problem is,
Carlos is so strung out...</i>

1972
02:20:51,193 --> 02:20:53,889
<i>he can't see the wolf
in the henhouse.</i>

1973
02:20:53,963 --> 02:20:57,797
<i>If I know Red Ryder, as soon
as Carlos does the AV-ers'dirty work,</i>

1974
02:20:57,866 --> 02:21:00,130
<i>they'll pull
his protection,</i>

1975
02:21:00,202 --> 02:21:03,729
<i>and it'll be open season
on Carlos Zuniga.</i>

1976
02:21:03,806 --> 02:21:05,899
<i>Carlos!</i>

1977
02:21:05,975 --> 02:21:08,068
No!

1978
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:16,984
<i>If I'm right,</i>

1979
02:21:17,052 --> 02:21:19,418
<i>all hell's
gonna break loose.</i>

1980
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:21,456
<i>That's our chance, Magic.</i>

1981
02:21:21,523 --> 02:21:24,151
<i>Where there's war,
there's opportunity.</i>

1982
02:21:24,226 --> 02:21:28,458
<i>What we gotta do is wake Montana up
and move Onda into power.</i>

1983
02:21:43,479 --> 02:21:48,007
No, listen! Before we fuck up everything we
built, I have to have a meeting with the B.G.A.

1984
02:21:48,083 --> 02:21:49,710
<i>- ¡Vamos ahorita!
- ¡Chingao!</i>

1985
02:21:49,785 --> 02:21:54,017
We're making a horrible mistake.
Can't you understand that?

1986
02:21:54,089 --> 02:21:57,286
- Are you blind or what?
- Wait a minute! I said I want you ready!

1987
02:21:57,359 --> 02:21:59,725
<i>I'm not gonna waste the lives
of our soldados for nothing!</i>

1988
02:21:59,795 --> 02:22:02,025
<i>First we talk.
We fight only if we have to!</i>

1989
02:22:02,097 --> 02:22:05,931
- The time to strike is now! We wait, they'll destroy us!
- No, Magic!

1990
02:22:06,001 --> 02:22:09,835
<i>We gotta back El Mero Mero. If he says
meet with the B.G.A., we gotta do it.</i>

1991
02:22:09,905 --> 02:22:14,035
What are you talkin' about? If we stand by,
we're gonna watch Onda go down in flames!

1992
02:22:14,109 --> 02:22:15,041
Magic!

1993
02:22:24,787 --> 02:22:28,746
I want you to hit Smokey.
I want him dead by tomorrow.

1994
02:22:28,824 --> 02:22:32,157
<i>- Orale.
- And you set up a meeting with Bonafide.</i>

1995
02:22:32,227 --> 02:22:36,664
<i>- Simon, Jefe.
- Geronimo, dile a tus soldados que se calmen.</i>

1996
02:22:52,782 --> 02:22:54,841
Yo.

1997
02:22:54,917 --> 02:22:57,044
Thought I was off
your list, ese.

1998
02:22:58,754 --> 02:23:01,245
No, Smokes.
We straight.

1999
02:23:01,324 --> 02:23:03,417
<i>That heist was
the huevo's fuckup.</i>

2000
02:23:06,863 --> 02:23:11,197
- So, what do you want?
- Think you can move 300?

2001
02:23:11,267 --> 02:23:14,600
<i>Easy as mantequilla
on a hot tortilla.</i>

2002
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:17,264
<i>Mira.</i>

2003
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:20,400
<i>Go make yourself
some planta.</i>

2004
02:23:22,979 --> 02:23:24,970
<i>Orale.
Gracias, carnal.</i>

2005
02:23:25,047 --> 02:23:28,312
<i>Por nada.
I owe you.</i>

2006
02:23:33,055 --> 02:23:35,421
Motherfucker!

2007
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:47,560
Get him around the park!

2008
02:23:47,637 --> 02:23:51,300
Three more California prison inmates
have been killed in gang violence,

2009
02:23:51,374 --> 02:23:54,070
bringing the tally of fatalities
this week to eleven.

2010
02:23:54,143 --> 02:23:56,577
Aguilar!

2011
02:23:56,646 --> 02:23:58,409
Aguilar.

2012
02:23:58,481 --> 02:24:01,473
Hey, chorizo. You still
want Popeye Savedra?

2013
02:24:01,550 --> 02:24:04,883
- Zuniga?
- They got a hit on me.

2014
02:24:04,954 --> 02:24:08,014
I need protection
or I'm dead.

2015
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:11,753
Listen, Smokey. If you want protection,
you're gonna have to give me more than Popeye.

2016
02:24:11,827 --> 02:24:15,024
I want everything on Onda.
Who they are and where they are.

2017
02:24:15,097 --> 02:24:17,065
Hey, no way.
Forget about it.

2018
02:24:17,133 --> 02:24:21,707
Hey, don't talk shit, Smokey. You stay out
there alone, you're dead. You said so yourself.

2019
02:24:21,732 --> 02:24:25,293
All right. All right!
I'll give it to you.

2020
02:24:25,363 --> 02:24:29,308
<i>The whole layout.
Capitanes, soldados.</i>

2021
02:24:29,365 --> 02:24:31,188
But I gotta be outta state first.

2022
02:24:31,212 --> 02:24:35,015
- We'll talk about it. Where can we meet? 
- St. Mary's Church, Fourth and Chicago.

2023
02:24:35,084 --> 02:24:38,481
- I know it.
- Be there in 15 minutes, chorizo, or forget about it.

2024
02:24:38,506 --> 02:24:40,030
I'll be there.

2025
02:25:46,244 --> 02:25:48,337
<i>Aguilar?</i>

2026
02:25:50,693 --> 02:25:53,560
This is Lieutenant Ivan Burnett.
He's from San Quentin.

2027
02:25:53,629 --> 02:25:56,257
- Detective Paco Aguilar. How ya doin'? Yeah.
- This the victim?

2028
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,468
Paco, we just heard
from Sacramento.

2029
02:25:59,535 --> 02:26:02,265
We are to "cooperate"
with Corrections on this.

2030
02:26:02,338 --> 02:26:04,568
<i>That means Burnett's
bringing down his entire team.</i>

2031
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:07,074
- What does that mean? I'm out of it?
- You heard me.

2032
02:26:07,143 --> 02:26:11,045
Well, this is bullshit, Captain. Come on,
I've been working on this case for months.

2033
02:26:11,113 --> 02:26:14,310
This vato was about to give
me the full lowdown on Onda.

2034
02:26:14,383 --> 02:26:16,715
What do you know
about Onda?

2035
02:26:16,786 --> 02:26:19,846
I had a run-in with a couple of
these guys here.

2036
02:26:22,658 --> 02:26:25,593
- The whole council. Captain, I'll need this picture.
- Fine.

2037
02:26:25,661 --> 02:26:28,391
<i>- My chief investigator will debrief him tomorrow.
- Wait a minute, man.</i>

2038
02:26:28,464 --> 02:26:30,591
<i>That's my evidence.
This is an East L.A. Case.</i>

2039
02:26:30,666 --> 02:26:34,659
Look, I appreciate your interest,
but this is much bigger than East L.A.

2040
02:26:34,737 --> 02:26:36,796
Things are poppin' up
all over the state.

2041
02:26:36,872 --> 02:26:38,737
You hear about
the grenade...

2042
02:26:38,808 --> 02:26:41,902
that was thrown into the Cheap Times
Social Club in Wilmington last night?

2043
02:26:43,846 --> 02:26:46,747
I'm betting that Zuniga here
was the quarterback.

2044
02:26:46,816 --> 02:26:50,547
Part of a plot started by his brother
in Quentin. It all comes outta Q.

2045
02:26:50,619 --> 02:26:52,553
All right, all right,
Lieutenant. Let's get inside.

2046
02:26:52,621 --> 02:26:54,555
This is happening here,
not in San Quentin.

2047
02:26:54,623 --> 02:26:57,353
It's all tied up to prison gangs now.
It's very complicated.

2048
02:26:57,426 --> 02:26:59,621
That's why
we're takin' over.

2049
02:26:59,695 --> 02:27:02,630
Do you speak Spanish?
You ever been in a street gang?

2050
02:27:02,698 --> 02:27:04,689
No, but my warden has
and he's Chicano.

2051
02:27:04,767 --> 02:27:07,600
Well, is your warden related
to someone on the Onda council?

2052
02:27:07,670 --> 02:27:10,662
Miklo Velka is my...
is my cousin.

2053
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:13,732
I am related to him
by blood and by this.

2054
02:27:13,809 --> 02:27:17,245
Look, Lieutenant,
I don't mean any disrespect,

2055
02:27:17,313 --> 02:27:19,747
but I think I can get further
on this thing than you can.

2056
02:27:19,815 --> 02:27:21,806
All I'm asking is
that I'm involved.

2057
02:27:28,324 --> 02:27:29,757
Thank you.

2058
02:27:30,392 --> 02:27:36,262
There is no war here, Bonafide. This was a
personal thing between Carlos and Pockets.

2059
02:27:36,331 --> 02:27:39,198
Carlos and Pockets were loose cannons.
That was business.

2060
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:43,034
But what you all did in L.A.
Night before last was bullshit.

2061
02:27:43,105 --> 02:27:45,039
There's gonna be more blood
on blades than broken bones...

2062
02:27:45,107 --> 02:27:47,041
'cause we ain't lettin' y'all
hit us in the back no more.

2063
02:27:47,109 --> 02:27:48,542
You wanna powwow?
You wanna talk? Go ahead, talk.

2064
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:51,579
Onda had nothing to do
with Cheap Times.

2065
02:27:51,647 --> 02:27:55,743
Carlos' brother, Smokey,
acted on his orders, not Onda's,

2066
02:27:55,818 --> 02:27:57,809
and he's paid the price
with his life.

2067
02:27:57,886 --> 02:27:59,945
Cheap Times make for
cheap lives. Lots of'em.

2068
02:28:00,022 --> 02:28:03,514
You want a war? We're ready.
Believe me, we'll win.

2069
02:28:03,592 --> 02:28:07,585
We've got more soldiers and they'll go all
the way... to the death if they have to.

2070
02:28:07,663 --> 02:28:10,655
I got soldiers. My soldiers are
ready to die. We can prove that.

2071
02:28:10,733 --> 02:28:14,669
Is that what you want? I guarantee
that's what the Aryans want.

2072
02:28:14,737 --> 02:28:20,004
We can stop the killing now,
you and me, right here.

2073
02:28:24,780 --> 02:28:28,807
Now your word means something here.
What about Folsom and Chino?

2074
02:28:28,884 --> 02:28:31,751
- I speak for them too.
- Uh-uh.

2075
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:34,948
Maybe for Soto at Folsom, but your word
ain't reachin' to Chino right now.

2076
02:28:35,023 --> 02:28:38,789
Mosca Lopez is crazy. I done
lost three people down there.

2077
02:28:39,995 --> 02:28:43,260
I can ask the warden
for a temporary transfer.

2078
02:28:43,332 --> 02:28:46,199
<i>- He might agree if you guarantee peace while I'm gone.
- Fuck a truce!</i>

2079
02:28:46,268 --> 02:28:48,259
We cannot...

2080
02:28:51,206 --> 02:28:53,231
Man, you got five days.

2081
02:28:55,377 --> 02:28:59,006
<i>I'm gonna hold
my side up for five days, man.</i>

2082
02:28:59,081 --> 02:29:01,106
Five days.

2083
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:08,349
Miklo will coordinate
Onda business in my absence.

2084
02:29:08,423 --> 02:29:11,790
<i>You can trust he'll make sure
nothing happens while I'm away.</i>

2085
02:29:14,596 --> 02:29:16,655
So do we have
a truce?

2086
02:29:17,733 --> 02:29:21,294
<i>- Right on.
- Well, well, well.</i>

2087
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:25,067
Wetbacks and Bonafide
porch monkeys holdin' hands.

2088
02:29:28,076 --> 02:29:30,510
You now have
a combined I.Q. Of two.

2089
02:29:30,579 --> 02:29:32,410
You're a dead man,
Wonder Bread!

2090
02:29:32,481 --> 02:29:35,473
Why don't you kiss my enriched
white ass, motherfucker?

2091
02:29:35,551 --> 02:29:37,883
<i>This here's my coon dog.
Get them coons, boy.</i>

2092
02:29:40,556 --> 02:29:42,490
Hey, Ryder!
What's goin' on?

2093
02:29:42,558 --> 02:29:46,858
Don't ask me what's goin' on! Ask,
"What are we doin' here? Is there a war?"

2094
02:29:46,929 --> 02:29:49,921
<i>Run 'em outta the goddamn
banks! Save the taxpayers some money!</i>

2095
02:29:49,998 --> 02:29:52,694
All right, gentlemen,
let's clear the yard!

2096
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:54,793
It's between
the niggers and the spics!

2097
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:56,861
We're white, white,
white, you motherfuckers!

2098
02:29:56,939 --> 02:29:59,601
<i>Jefe, will Bonafide
listen to me?</i>

2099
02:29:59,675 --> 02:30:01,609
Magic and the others
are warriors.

2100
02:30:01,677 --> 02:30:04,737
If I put one of them in charge,
Bonafide would never trust me.

2101
02:30:04,813 --> 02:30:07,543
You're a jailhouse lawyer,
a counselor.

2102
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:10,710
- He knows you'll follow my wishes.
- But what if he's lying?

2103
02:30:10,786 --> 02:30:13,254
What if the B.G.A.
Doesn't want peace?

2104
02:30:13,322 --> 02:30:16,553
Nobody in here knows what peace is.
They've never had it.

2105
02:30:16,625 --> 02:30:19,788
<i>I'm talking
about power, carnal.</i>

2106
02:30:19,862 --> 02:30:23,923
The only way for us to gain real power
is for black and brown to come together.

2107
02:30:23,999 --> 02:30:27,093
<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

2108
02:30:27,169 --> 02:30:30,605
<i>Huh. And I thought Popeye
Savedra was the leader of Onda.</i>

2109
02:30:30,672 --> 02:30:33,698
It's hard to buy it's
that little guy down there.

2110
02:30:33,775 --> 02:30:36,676
You better believe it.

2111
02:30:36,745 --> 02:30:39,213
He's got what you
call "charisma."

2112
02:30:39,281 --> 02:30:42,307
You really think he can do something
to stop the violence?

2113
02:30:42,384 --> 02:30:45,785
<i>Montana's got something that makes you
wanna listen to him. He's got a lot of heart.</i>

2114
02:30:45,854 --> 02:30:48,379
If anybody can stop
this war, it's him.

2115
02:30:48,457 --> 02:30:51,893
I can always bring in the guns,
but I'd rather it be him.

2116
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:53,951
I don't like you
traveling alone.

2117
02:30:54,029 --> 02:30:57,226
I don't trust the administration.
I don't trust anybody.

2118
02:30:57,299 --> 02:31:01,326
Don't worry. The warden's
guaranteeing my passage.

2119
02:31:01,403 --> 02:31:05,396
<i>Top secret route.
Oye.</i>

2120
02:31:06,842 --> 02:31:09,709
I made a deal
with the vato.

2121
02:31:09,778 --> 02:31:14,044
I get to spend the night in Delano,
see my daughter.

2122
02:31:16,385 --> 02:31:20,446
After 14 years.
Can you believe it?

2123
02:31:20,522 --> 02:31:22,387
<i>Come on, Segura.</i>

2124
02:31:22,457 --> 02:31:23,890
Move it.

2125
02:31:27,629 --> 02:31:29,756
<i>Jefe.</i>

2126
02:31:31,300 --> 02:31:33,632
<i>Huacha. You tell
those vatos...</i>

2127
02:31:33,702 --> 02:31:36,865
<i>to find some shade and chill out
'til I get back, eh?</i>

2128
02:31:36,939 --> 02:31:38,873
You got it.

2129
02:31:45,047 --> 02:31:47,311
<i>What time's
my daughter coming?</i>

2130
02:31:47,382 --> 02:31:49,942
She'll be here
about 7:00 sharp.

2131
02:32:04,099 --> 02:32:08,092
- We'll rack you at 6:00 tomorrow for a shower.
- I'll be waiting.

2132
02:32:12,674 --> 02:32:17,077
<i>- Psst! Name's Wallace.
- Montana.</i>

2133
02:32:17,145 --> 02:32:20,979
Say, amigo, you ain't got
no street smokes, do ya?

2134
02:32:21,049 --> 02:32:23,176
<i>This state tobacco, man,
it'll kill ya.</i>

2135
02:32:23,251 --> 02:32:25,276
I don't smoke.

2136
02:32:26,621 --> 02:32:28,851
You don't smoke, huh?

2137
02:32:28,924 --> 02:32:32,519
Man, I can't wait for these
son-of-a-bitches to let me outta here...

2138
02:32:32,594 --> 02:32:34,892
<i>so I can find me
a field crew.</i>

2139
02:32:34,963 --> 02:32:38,421
Do me some pickin' so I can send my old
lady some money back in Louisiana.

2140
02:32:39,935 --> 02:32:43,268
<i>- Yeah, I used to pick a little when I was a kid.
- Huh.</i>

2141
02:32:43,338 --> 02:32:46,102
Me, I been followin'
this crop all my life.

2142
02:32:46,174 --> 02:32:48,438
If it ain't that,
I takes me a little drink.

2143
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:52,947
<i>If it ain't that, they got me
behind bars tryin'to dry out.</i>

2144
02:32:55,751 --> 02:32:57,946
You ever pick
any grapes, Wallace?

2145
02:33:00,756 --> 02:33:04,590
No, I ain't never picked no grapes.
But I done cut me a bunch.

2146
02:33:06,962 --> 02:33:09,021
Yeah.

2147
02:33:17,873 --> 02:33:20,068
- Here.
- Oh, man, thank you.

2148
02:33:24,112 --> 02:33:27,548
Is it... Say, amigo, d-do you mind
any if I have two?

2149
02:33:27,616 --> 02:33:30,517
- Ah, keep the pack. They're only for trade.
- Oh, man.

2150
02:33:30,585 --> 02:33:34,043
<i>Lights out.</i>

2151
02:33:34,122 --> 02:33:38,320
<i>You know, when I was a kid,
I used to love to pick.</i>

2152
02:33:40,062 --> 02:33:45,159
Nothing like fresh vegetables
and fruit right from the vine.

2153
02:33:47,669 --> 02:33:50,968
Yeah.
Hmm.

2154
02:33:59,548 --> 02:34:02,949
Okay, the escort's on his way.
You'll have one hour with your father.

2155
02:34:03,018 --> 02:34:05,486
- Let's go.
- I'd like a couple of seconds to straighten up.

2156
02:34:05,553 --> 02:34:08,454
I don't care who you are in San Quentin.
You're nobody here in Kern County.

2157
02:34:08,523 --> 02:34:11,321
<i>Look, officer. I haven't seen
my daughter in 14 years.</i>

2158
02:34:11,392 --> 02:34:14,327
Could I just take a couple of seconds
to straighten up?

2159
02:34:14,395 --> 02:34:16,420
Please?

2160
02:34:21,169 --> 02:34:25,071
<i>I'm gonna put your daughter in the
visiting room. You've got one hour.</i>

2161
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:28,735
The clock is ticking.
One hour. Be right back.

2162
02:34:32,413 --> 02:34:35,280
Mornin', Montana.

2163
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:38,012
Morning, Wallace.

2164
02:34:38,086 --> 02:34:41,249
See they botherin' with ya
early in the mornin', huh?

2165
02:34:43,091 --> 02:34:46,322
No. It's a good day.

2166
02:34:46,394 --> 02:34:49,227
I'm not gonna let
anything ruin it.

2167
02:34:49,297 --> 02:34:53,461
Aaah! Ooh, them damn
short-handle holes!

2168
02:34:53,535 --> 02:34:55,730
Yeah, I used to
feel those myself.

2169
02:34:55,804 --> 02:34:58,170
Oh... Oh!

2170
02:34:59,707 --> 02:35:02,767
Here, amigo.
Why don't you use this?

2171
02:35:04,712 --> 02:35:06,771
Yeah, well,
I'll hold it for you.

2172
02:35:09,651 --> 02:35:11,812
Thank you.

2173
02:35:11,886 --> 02:35:14,650
<i>Yeah, chingo de tiempo
since I felt this good.</i>

2174
02:35:14,722 --> 02:35:16,656
<i>My daughter's coming today.
Mi hijita.</i>

2175
02:35:16,724 --> 02:35:20,592
- Oh, man, today is gonna be such a good day for you.
- Yeah.

2176
02:35:20,662 --> 02:35:22,653
Your daughter's
gonna be so proud of you.

2177
02:35:22,730 --> 02:35:24,061
There.

2178
02:35:24,132 --> 02:35:26,657
Uh-huh.

2179
02:35:26,734 --> 02:35:29,703
Now this is what they call
"a change of plans."

2180
02:35:29,771 --> 02:35:33,605
<i>For Cheap Times!
For Cheap Times!</i>

2181
02:35:33,675 --> 02:35:36,200
<i>Son-of-a-bitch!</i>

2182
02:35:36,277 --> 02:35:38,677
Motherfucker, think you can
blow up my brother! Uh-uh!

2183
02:35:38,746 --> 02:35:41,681
<i>- Daaah!
- You can go join your maker now.</i>

2184
02:35:41,749 --> 02:35:44,115
For what falls
to the floor is his.

2185
02:35:46,154 --> 02:35:48,486
Don't forget your smokes.

2186
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:55,414
- You want a war? I'll give you a fuckin' war!
- No! Stop him!

2187
02:36:55,490 --> 02:36:58,425
No! They're waiting for us
to run in blind!

2188
02:36:58,493 --> 02:37:00,825
<i>They'll cut us down!
We gotta think like Mero Mero.</i>

2189
02:37:00,895 --> 02:37:06,197
<i>- You're not Mero Mero!
- No, I'm not! But I'm alive!</i>

2190
02:37:06,267 --> 02:37:10,294
<i>And I'm gonna stay that way! And I
want mi familia to stay that way too!</i>

2191
02:37:10,371 --> 02:37:13,340
We gotta plan like men,
not get shot down like dogs!

2192
02:37:15,176 --> 02:37:17,610
Wait and be ready,
Magic!

2193
02:37:19,614 --> 02:37:23,175
Again. How'd you know
he was in Delano?

2194
02:37:23,251 --> 02:37:25,776
How'd you know the head
of La Onda was there?

2195
02:37:25,853 --> 02:37:28,913
Man, I do not give
a good goddamn...

2196
02:37:28,990 --> 02:37:31,015
who that taco-eatin'
motherfucker was.

2197
02:37:31,092 --> 02:37:33,356
Oh, who that taco-eatin'
motherfucker was!

2198
02:37:33,428 --> 02:37:37,125
- Do you know who you killed, asshole?
- Your mama!

2199
02:37:37,198 --> 02:37:41,635
<i>- We're gonna stay here all day until you...
- He won't crack.</i>

2200
02:37:41,703 --> 02:37:44,365
Nope. He's been in
for 30 years.

2201
02:37:44,439 --> 02:37:47,237
He's as tough
as three-inch steel.

2202
02:37:47,308 --> 02:37:50,300
<i>When I get back, I'm gonna bust your ass.</i>

2203
02:37:50,378 --> 02:37:52,846
I'll be here.

2204
02:37:58,119 --> 02:38:00,053
Come in here.

2205
02:38:01,889 --> 02:38:05,017
<i>Yeah, that's the man. That's the one
who ordered it. Bring him in here.</i>

2206
02:38:05,093 --> 02:38:08,551
- Tell him what you told me.
- I didn't order no hit on nobody.

2207
02:38:08,629 --> 02:38:10,722
That'd be like throwin'
gasoline on fire right now.

2208
02:38:10,798 --> 02:38:13,323
Don't bullshit me, man.
I ain't no sucker.

2209
02:38:13,401 --> 02:38:16,336
<i>He's B.G.A.
He made the hit. He's your man.</i>

2210
02:38:16,404 --> 02:38:19,134
I ain't tryin' to play you
for no sucker, brother.

2211
02:38:19,207 --> 02:38:22,802
I'm just tellin' you, if I wanted to hit
Montana, I'd have used a free-lancer.

2212
02:38:22,877 --> 02:38:25,038
<i>An AV-er, so it
couldn't be traced.</i>

2213
02:38:25,113 --> 02:38:27,775
I'm not
a stupid man, sir.

2214
02:38:27,849 --> 02:38:31,046
<i>That's enough.
Come on over here with me.</i>

2215
02:38:34,989 --> 02:38:37,719
<i>- Is that your man?
- Yeah, that's him.</i>

2216
02:38:37,792 --> 02:38:41,023
- Why don't you let me talk to him?
- No way!

2217
02:38:41,095 --> 02:38:44,030
He ain't gonna
tell you nothin'.

2218
02:38:44,098 --> 02:38:48,034
You wanna get to the bottom of this
problem? You wanna deal with it?

2219
02:38:48,102 --> 02:38:50,195
Now, I know
he'll talk to me.

2220
02:38:51,506 --> 02:38:53,440
Your call.

2221
02:39:13,895 --> 02:39:17,763
- Goddamn. The Man got you down here too?
- Yeah.

2222
02:39:19,233 --> 02:39:21,667
Look here.

2223
02:39:24,172 --> 02:39:26,140
Why you hit Montana?

2224
02:39:28,543 --> 02:39:31,603
Oh, I dig. The Man got
his eyes and ears in the wall.

2225
02:39:31,679 --> 02:39:34,147
Don't sweat, brother.
I'm gonna maintain.

2226
02:39:35,416 --> 02:39:37,350
Who ordered the hit?

2227
02:39:39,921 --> 02:39:41,889
You did.

2228
02:39:41,956 --> 02:39:44,151
Come here.

2229
02:39:47,028 --> 02:39:48,962
Oh!

2230
02:39:49,030 --> 02:39:51,191
You did, man!

2231
02:39:51,265 --> 02:39:54,792
- You did. I got your kite, man.
- I didn't send you nothin'.

2232
02:39:54,869 --> 02:39:57,064
<i>- Ow! Ow! Fuck!
- Who ordered it?</i>

2233
02:39:57,138 --> 02:39:59,936
You did, man. You did.
I got your comb.

2234
02:40:00,007 --> 02:40:02,874
<i>- I know your design.
- You got my comb?</i>

2235
02:40:02,944 --> 02:40:06,380
Yeah, I got your comb. I opened it up.
I read the message, I burned it.

2236
02:40:06,447 --> 02:40:08,847
It was your comb, man!

2237
02:40:10,685 --> 02:40:12,846
<i>Listen, man,
we've got five minutes.</i>

2238
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:15,650
<i>The warden let me come in here
to talk to you about Montana's murder.</i>

2239
02:40:15,723 --> 02:40:18,021
Who the fuck are you
to come here like this?

2240
02:40:18,092 --> 02:40:20,390
Montana's none of
your fucking business!

2241
02:40:20,461 --> 02:40:22,622
You gotta listen to me, Miklo.

2242
02:40:22,697 --> 02:40:24,722
Bonafide says somebody
counterfeited his comb...

2243
02:40:24,799 --> 02:40:27,029
and put a phony message
in it to hit Montana.

2244
02:40:27,101 --> 02:40:30,070
- The B.G.A. Didn't do it.
- That's bullshit!

2245
02:40:30,138 --> 02:40:32,072
We know the fuckin' B.G.A.
Killed him.

2246
02:40:32,140 --> 02:40:35,371
Yeah? Well, the administration doesn't
think so. And what if they're right?

2247
02:40:35,443 --> 02:40:40,278
You wanna be responsible for starting a
fucking war against the wrong people? Huh?

2248
02:40:41,782 --> 02:40:44,080
Listen, man,
I know you hate me.

2249
02:40:44,152 --> 02:40:47,747
I shot your leg off, and that's something I'm
gonna have to live with for the rest of my life.

2250
02:40:47,822 --> 02:40:52,486
But you're still my blood, and I'm not gonna
stand here and watch you destroy yourself.

2251
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:56,690
If you start this war, you and
your vatos will be committing suicide.

2252
02:40:56,764 --> 02:40:58,755
Now look over there.
You see the warden?

2253
02:40:58,833 --> 02:41:02,735
<i>He's got all the firepower he needs, and
he ain't afraid to use it, believe me.</i>

2254
02:41:02,803 --> 02:41:04,964
Do you want that?

2255
02:41:07,241 --> 02:41:09,675
Oh, you're The Man now,
aren't you?

2256
02:41:09,744 --> 02:41:12,372
Look, Montana left you
in charge, right?

2257
02:41:12,446 --> 02:41:15,006
Be a real leader, man.
Protect your people.

2258
02:41:15,082 --> 02:41:17,550
Meet with Bonafide.
What do you got to lose?

2259
02:41:23,457 --> 02:41:25,425
I'll meet him in the yard.

2260
02:41:25,626 --> 02:41:29,221
<i>One lieutenant each.
No guards around.</i>

2261
02:41:29,296 --> 02:41:32,231
That's far enough.
Let 'em go on their own.

2262
02:41:42,309 --> 02:41:45,710
I swear to you,
it wasn't the B.G.A.

2263
02:41:45,779 --> 02:41:48,771
Montana was a stand-up dude.
We were set up!

2264
02:41:48,849 --> 02:41:51,909
That old man was no jive-ass punk.
He was hard-core B.G.A.

2265
02:41:51,985 --> 02:41:55,148
That's right. That's why
it don't make no sense.

2266
02:41:55,222 --> 02:41:58,988
I take out Montana with my own man?
That's suicide.

2267
02:41:59,059 --> 02:42:03,758
Now you do what you wanna do,
but think about this:

2268
02:42:03,830 --> 02:42:07,789
Who you think stands to gain
if B.G.A. And Onda war?

2269
02:42:07,868 --> 02:42:10,894
The fuckin' A.V.!

2270
02:42:10,971 --> 02:42:12,996
<i>Oh, yeah, they want us
to take each other out.</i>

2271
02:42:13,073 --> 02:42:17,305
Then they step in and take over
everything. We go back to bein' slaves.

2272
02:42:17,377 --> 02:42:20,505
The AV-ers.

2273
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:25,074
They're the only ones who could've gotten
Montana's route from the white guards. Right?

2274
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:27,347
I work with Lightning
in the wood shop.

2275
02:42:27,421 --> 02:42:32,825
He gets my comb, he counterfeits it,
he sends it to Wallace.

2276
02:42:34,628 --> 02:42:37,529
<i>- It's possible.
- And now that motherfucker Red Ryder...</i>

2277
02:42:37,597 --> 02:42:41,192
sittin' in a front-row seat just waitin'
on us to take each other out.

2278
02:42:41,268 --> 02:42:45,728
- So what do you propose?
- I say whip those motherfuckers together.

2279
02:42:45,806 --> 02:42:48,297
We do to them
what they tryin' to do to us.

2280
02:42:51,778 --> 02:42:53,712
<i>You see those
pinche vultures?</i>

2281
02:42:53,780 --> 02:42:57,045
They're watchin' us with
a magnifying glass right now.

2282
02:42:58,652 --> 02:43:02,383
So for the next six months,
we'll practice a good-neighbor policy.

2283
02:43:03,990 --> 02:43:06,481
So we got a deal?
We join forces?

2284
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,585
Yeah.

2285
02:43:08,662 --> 02:43:11,722
And we'll celebrate a big
Mexican holiday together.

2286
02:43:11,798 --> 02:43:14,528
Now which one
you talkin' about?

2287
02:43:14,601 --> 02:43:16,501
<i>Dia de los muertos.</i>

2288
02:43:16,570 --> 02:43:18,299
That means what now?

2289
02:43:18,371 --> 02:43:20,396
Day of the Dead.

2290
02:43:22,576 --> 02:43:26,342
- All right.
- Right.

2291
02:43:30,283 --> 02:43:32,376
In six months.

2292
02:43:32,452 --> 02:43:34,386
My man.

2293
02:43:34,454 --> 02:43:36,547
They're shakin' hands.
We got a truce.

2294
02:43:36,623 --> 02:43:39,717
We won't congratulate ourselves
too soon. We'll wait and see.

2295
02:43:44,498 --> 02:43:46,932
<i>I don't trust that dude.</i>

2296
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,161
No, no, no.
This boy's in way over his head.

2297
02:43:49,236 --> 02:43:51,670
He ain't got no choice
but to go with us right now.

2298
02:43:51,738 --> 02:43:55,504
<i>We help them take out the AV-ers,
we're making the mayates stronger, ese.</i>

2299
02:43:55,575 --> 02:43:57,566
<i>It's okay, carnal.</i>

2300
02:43:57,644 --> 02:44:01,273
When you expect nothing and you get
everything, that's destiny.

2301
02:44:01,348 --> 02:44:06,115
The B.G.A. Wants to help us take out
the AV-ers? All right.

2302
02:44:06,186 --> 02:44:08,484
We'll throw a little
white meat to the dogs.

2303
02:44:08,555 --> 02:44:10,523
Then we'll rob
the house.

2304
02:44:15,962 --> 02:44:17,486
<i>¡Orale!</i>

2305
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:32,771
<i>Gracias, carnal.
You were right.</i>

2306
02:44:32,846 --> 02:44:35,110
You did the right
thing, Miklo.

2307
02:44:35,181 --> 02:44:37,115
Tell your mom
I love her, okay?

2308
02:44:37,183 --> 02:44:39,276
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Yeah.

2309
02:45:27,817 --> 02:45:30,547
Juanito, Juanito.

2310
02:45:32,923 --> 02:45:36,086
Hey, homes, if anybody
messes with you, ese.

2311
02:46:08,858 --> 02:46:11,520
<i>I'm sorry, ama.</i>

2312
02:46:11,595 --> 02:46:14,086
<i>¡Perdoname!</i>

2313
02:46:14,164 --> 02:46:18,225
<i>- I loved Juanito.
- I know, mi hijo.</i>

2314
02:46:18,301 --> 02:46:21,065
<i>I loved him, ama.</i>

2315
02:46:21,137 --> 02:46:24,197
<i>...carnalito, familia.</i>

2316
02:46:47,263 --> 02:46:49,231
I'm sorry.

2317
02:46:50,133 --> 02:46:53,296
I missed you.

2318
02:46:53,370 --> 02:46:55,804
<i>Mi familia.</i>

2319
02:47:11,287 --> 02:47:13,221
...she put the handcuffs on,
two days later, I come back.

2320
02:47:13,289 --> 02:47:16,087
She's got eye hooks drilled
in the door. She's got thongs.

2321
02:47:16,159 --> 02:47:21,153
I swear to God, she absolutely
loved it! She became or...

2322
02:48:07,911 --> 02:48:09,776
You got it. One more.

2323
02:48:09,846 --> 02:48:12,542
Come on, one more.

2324
02:48:17,721 --> 02:48:20,952
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
No more. No more, man.</i>

2325
02:48:21,024 --> 02:48:23,151
I'm through, okay?
That's it.

2326
02:48:23,226 --> 02:48:25,091
<i>Ten cents
a fuckin'hour.</i>

2327
02:48:25,161 --> 02:48:28,562
<i>That spic warden ain't gettin'
a nickel's worth of overtime outta me.</i>

2328
02:48:33,803 --> 02:48:35,998
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

2329
02:48:36,072 --> 02:48:38,870
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you
goddamn people! Are you...</i>

2330
02:48:38,942 --> 02:48:42,343
<i>Goddamn it! You stupid fuckin'
asshole! You got it in my eyes!</i>

2331
02:48:42,412 --> 02:48:45,745
Lousy...
Aaah!

2332
02:49:00,498 --> 02:49:03,043
<i>Now everybody keeps their mouth shut,
you understand me?</i>

2333
02:49:03,076 --> 02:49:05,704
This way, won't be no problem
with nobody when the shit go down.

2334
02:49:06,256 --> 02:49:10,433
- The plan's gonna work, Bonafide.
- I'm telling you, man, we keep our stake together.

2335
02:49:10,508 --> 02:49:12,999
- That way we control the whole joint, right?
- All right.

2336
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:51,947
You want some of this?
You want some of this?

2337
02:50:01,875 --> 02:50:04,937
Who do these punks
think they are? Look at this!

2338
02:50:05,022 --> 02:50:08,458
It's unbelievable.
Every hit was strategic.

2339
02:50:08,799 --> 02:50:11,297
First they knocked off
most of the A.V. Leadership,

2340
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:13,531
and then they
finished off the B.G.A.

2341
02:50:13,695 --> 02:50:17,265
I don't like being lied to.
I want the Onda council broken up.

2342
02:50:17,304 --> 02:50:20,899
<i>Use interstate compact. I want 'em outta here.
Get 'em outta here before the end of the week.</i>

2343
02:50:21,178 --> 02:50:25,444
<i>Taxpayers
just saved another three million bucks.</i>

2344
02:50:25,516 --> 02:50:28,531
<i>Everything's a fuckin'joke to
you, man. What's your problem?</i>

2345
02:50:28,556 --> 02:50:32,601
<i>- What's my problem? You got a problem!
- No, you don't understand, man.</i>

2346
02:50:32,696 --> 02:50:36,235
That little bastard's up there playing
God and he's got an army to back him up.

2347
02:50:36,305 --> 02:50:39,337
<i>Yeah, I don't understand, right?
I don't ever understand, right?</i>

2348
02:50:39,384 --> 02:50:42,808
Well, as long as he's doing it behind bars,
it's not gonna affect you or me, is it?

2349
02:50:42,833 --> 02:50:44,960
<i>- Is it?
- Oh, it's not gonna affect us?</i>

2350
02:50:45,036 --> 02:50:46,970
Won't affect
any of us, will it?

2351
02:51:15,399 --> 02:51:17,526
You used me.

2352
02:51:17,602 --> 02:51:21,561
I tried to save your life and you
used me to set up the B.G.A.

2353
02:51:21,709 --> 02:51:24,339
They would've come after us
if we hadn't got them first.

2354
02:51:24,408 --> 02:51:28,108
<i>- I did what I had to for my brothers to survive.
- Your brothers?</i>

2355
02:51:28,139 --> 02:51:31,578
And what am I, Miklo?
Man, you grew up with me.

2356
02:51:31,649 --> 02:51:35,380
You slept in my room.
You wore my fuckin' clothes!

2357
02:51:35,453 --> 02:51:39,514
How could you use your own flesh and
blood to help massacre all those people?

2358
02:51:39,590 --> 02:51:43,720
I didn't wanna hurt you, Paco.
In here, you use what you've got.

2359
02:51:43,794 --> 02:51:46,888
<i>Without your help,
a lot of carnales would've died.</i>

2360
02:51:47,535 --> 02:51:48,386
Gracias...

2361
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:51,402
Don't you thank me.
I hate what you did.

2362
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:53,509
I hate what
you stand for.

2363
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:58,979
You know, Paquito,
for a long time I hated you.

2364
02:52:00,711 --> 02:52:03,544
I blamed you for everything.

2365
02:52:03,614 --> 02:52:06,515
But then I realized something
that changed my life.

2366
02:52:07,919 --> 02:52:11,912
Everything you did...
even shooting my leg off...

2367
02:52:11,989 --> 02:52:14,219
forced me into my destiny.

2368
02:52:14,292 --> 02:52:16,453
Made me discover myself.

2369
02:52:16,527 --> 02:52:19,428
Find my real family,
my home.

2370
02:52:19,497 --> 02:52:21,431
Here.

2371
02:52:21,499 --> 02:52:25,128
<i>Inside these walls,
I found the strength of La Raza.</i>

2372
02:52:25,202 --> 02:52:29,025
<i>You got no fuckin' idea
what La Raza means.</i>

2373
02:52:29,104 --> 02:52:35,009
<i>It's about our people out there, working,
surviving, with pride and dignity. That's raza.</i>

2374
02:52:35,212 --> 02:52:38,458
Not lying and murdering.

2375
02:52:38,581 --> 02:52:40,879
All you got is
your white father's hate.

2376
02:52:43,361 --> 02:52:47,161
Still hung up on my
fluorescent skin, vato? Hmm?

2377
02:52:47,892 --> 02:52:49,917
He wasn't my real father.

2378
02:52:49,994 --> 02:52:54,090
Montana was.
He taught me about respect.

2379
02:52:54,165 --> 02:52:56,156
<i>You gotta be willing
to die for it.</i>

2380
02:52:56,234 --> 02:53:00,762
Like you. Like you not deserting me
after the car crash at El Pino.

2381
02:53:00,838 --> 02:53:02,863
That was real respect
for a brother.

2382
02:53:05,679 --> 02:53:07,873
<i>And I'll always
love you for it, carnal.</i>

2383
02:53:07,945 --> 02:53:11,540
Miklo, it's not about drive-bys
and gang fights anymore.

2384
02:53:11,616 --> 02:53:15,017
<i>- It's about...
- Let's stop fighting, carnal! We're family.</i>

2385
02:53:15,086 --> 02:53:18,278
We should help each other,
not cut each other's throats.

2386
02:53:22,026 --> 02:53:24,221
Let's be brothers again.

2387
02:53:30,635 --> 02:53:35,004
Just because you're a cop and I'm a con
doesn't mean we can't cooperate.

2388
02:53:37,141 --> 02:53:41,100
I can give you tips from inside that
could really help you out on the street.

2389
02:53:44,063 --> 02:53:46,727
You got a lot of power
out there, man.

2390
02:53:46,938 --> 02:53:50,585
Your guidance and advice
would be invaluable to me.

2391
02:53:51,657 --> 02:53:55,413
What are you asking me?
To be a member of your gang?

2392
02:53:55,438 --> 02:53:57,260
Are you outta
your fuckin' mind?

2393
02:53:58,387 --> 02:54:02,061
Do you remember how we
took out Spider for Cruz?

2394
02:54:02,133 --> 02:54:05,068
Together, Paco.
We're unbeatable.

2395
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:13,533
Your Onda's not my onda,
and it never will be.

2396
02:54:16,365 --> 02:54:19,391
Paco!

2397
02:54:21,419 --> 02:54:24,547
I'll always be
your brother, vato loco.

2398
02:54:25,512 --> 02:54:27,605
Never.

2399
02:54:36,334 --> 02:54:39,030
<i>- Orale, Chivito.
- Tucha, carnal. They're watching, homes.</i>

2400
02:54:39,103 --> 02:54:41,128
I know they are.
Let 'em watch.

2401
02:54:41,709 --> 02:54:45,568
<i>The show's just beginning
and they don't even know it.</i>

2402
02:54:45,706 --> 02:54:48,675
<i>This will probably be our last
meeting together, carnales.</i>

2403
02:54:50,948 --> 02:54:55,442
They're trying to break Onda up.
But you know what?

2404
02:54:55,519 --> 02:54:58,249
They're only
helping us grow.

2405
02:54:59,757 --> 02:55:01,782
They're using
the interstate compact...

2406
02:55:01,859 --> 02:55:05,158
<i>to exchange each of you who's from
out of state for cons from Califas.</i>

2407
02:55:06,864 --> 02:55:09,697
So, Chivo, they're
sending you back to Arizona.

2408
02:55:09,767 --> 02:55:12,793
<i>- ¿Como dices?
- Hey, man, we can't do nothin' about it.</i>

2409
02:55:12,870 --> 02:55:15,964
You gotta go. But at least
you'll be back to your mom, man.

2410
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:19,490
She needs anything, let me know.
I'll take care of her.

2411
02:55:19,685 --> 02:55:23,263
<i>Orale, homes.
Simon que si.</i>

2412
02:55:23,505 --> 02:55:26,648
Geronimo goes back
to Texas.

2413
02:55:27,271 --> 02:55:31,139
<i>- You straighten your son out, ¿que no?
- Simon.</i>

2414
02:55:33,431 --> 02:55:35,456
They're trying
to break up La Onda!

2415
02:55:35,940 --> 02:55:37,874
But we're gonna
turn it on 'em!

2416
02:55:39,664 --> 02:55:41,689
And you know how
we're gonna do that?

2417
02:55:43,367 --> 02:55:47,326
Each of you is gonna establish
your own chapters.

2418
02:55:47,889 --> 02:55:53,084
La Onda has $15,000 for each of you
so you can start things out strong.

2419
02:55:53,506 --> 02:55:57,512
We're gonna spread La Onda
gospel Billy Graham style!

2420
02:55:57,581 --> 02:55:59,640
Yeah.
Say it, homey.

2421
02:56:05,589 --> 02:56:07,614
<i>El Mero Mero
had a dream.</i>

2422
02:56:10,961 --> 02:56:13,122
We are that dream.

2423
02:56:14,365 --> 02:56:17,528
We're gonna multiply
in numbers undreamed of.

2424
02:56:17,601 --> 02:56:20,069
<i>In every pinta,
every barrio.</i>

2425
02:56:20,137 --> 02:56:22,970
Every southwestern state.

2426
02:56:23,614 --> 02:56:25,616
La Onda
has a destiny...

2427
02:56:25,706 --> 02:56:28,174
and no one can stop us.

2428
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:35,225
<i>¡Eso!</i>

2429
02:56:38,043 --> 02:56:39,229
<i>¡Orale!</i>

2430
02:56:40,197 --> 02:56:41,415
<i>¡Viva La Onda!</i>

2431
02:56:41,492 --> 02:56:43,960
<i>- Tocale, carnal. Orale.
- Viva.</i>

2432
02:56:54,222 --> 02:56:56,622
<i>What about me, carnal?</i>

2433
02:56:58,140 --> 02:56:59,742
Where do I go?

2434
02:56:59,812 --> 02:57:02,405
<i>You stay with me, carnal.</i>

2435
02:57:02,430 --> 02:57:04,830
You're the eyes
behind my back.

2436
02:57:05,226 --> 02:57:07,285
The leg I don't have.

2437
02:57:07,527 --> 02:57:09,927
<i>The other half
of mi corazon.</i>

2438
02:57:22,851 --> 02:57:25,149
You ordered me
to destroy this mold.

2439
02:57:27,522 --> 02:57:32,653
But I kept it for protection...
from you.

2440
02:57:36,397 --> 02:57:38,729
Now I want you
to destroy it.

2441
02:57:57,118 --> 02:58:00,087
- I loved him.
- We both loved him.

2442
02:58:00,155 --> 02:58:03,454
But we did what we
had to do for Onda!

2443
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:06,829
You were right.

2444
02:58:36,290 --> 02:58:38,656
I give my life to you.

2445
02:58:40,855 --> 02:58:43,551
<i>¡Jefe!</i>

2446
02:58:51,731 --> 02:58:53,790
<i>Simon.</i>

2447
02:59:06,954 --> 02:59:09,320
<i>- What are we doing here?
- No Ilores, vato.</i>

2448
02:59:09,390 --> 02:59:11,524
<i>No mas ven.</i>

2449
02:59:12,993 --> 02:59:16,429
- Come on, man.
- Man, you got me outta bed to come down here?

2450
02:59:16,497 --> 02:59:18,883
Think you lost more
than your hair, vato.

2451
02:59:18,977 --> 02:59:22,039
Ha! Don't believe all that
shit you hear about Samson, ese.

2452
02:59:22,086 --> 02:59:25,366
I'm just strippin' myself
down to the bone, homes.

2453
02:59:25,439 --> 02:59:28,602
<i>- What if I said I wouldn't come?
- Shit, I knew you would come.</i>

2454
02:59:29,844 --> 02:59:31,835
<i>Shee... Huacha.</i>

2455
02:59:31,912 --> 02:59:34,540
Come look at yourself
in the mirror, ese.

2456
02:59:38,952 --> 02:59:40,886
Oh, man.

2457
02:59:41,189 --> 02:59:43,385
<i>It's not all
marked up, man.</i>

2458
02:59:43,539 --> 02:59:45,530
<i>It's a sign
of respect.</i>

2459
02:59:46,135 --> 02:59:50,344
For ten years, man, I've been
Star Trekking in the Twilight Zone.

2460
02:59:50,369 --> 02:59:54,203
<i>Thought if I came and looked at this,
I might find my way back, ¿que no?</i>

2461
02:59:55,469 --> 02:59:58,267
<i>Damn!
We were all innocent, eh.</i>

2462
02:59:58,768 --> 03:00:02,298
That's all gone, Cruzito.
It ain't like that anymore.

2463
03:00:02,376 --> 03:00:05,834
<i>What, not even a little carnalismo
left in there, ese?</i>

2464
03:00:05,913 --> 03:00:09,705
What, you think you use brotherhood up
like a shot of tequila?

2465
03:00:09,815 --> 03:00:13,481
<i>You just drink it down,
it burns, makes you feel good, ya?</i>

2466
03:00:13,554 --> 03:00:15,886
<i>And you're left with a hangover
the rest of your life?</i>

2467
03:00:15,917 --> 03:00:17,697
Look, man, you showed me
your mural.

2468
03:00:17,762 --> 03:00:19,855
You're a good artist.
I think you're the best.

2469
03:00:20,470 --> 03:00:21,697
Now come on. Let's go.

2470
03:00:21,830 --> 03:00:24,871
Just 'cause you wear sunglasses
don't mean you're blind, ese.

2471
03:00:24,948 --> 03:00:27,542
Oh, shit! You wanna know
what I see up there?

2472
03:00:27,769 --> 03:00:30,660
A fantasy, man.
A dream.

2473
03:00:30,905 --> 03:00:33,567
Three vatos looking for
something that wasn't there.

2474
03:00:33,641 --> 03:00:38,010
Loco, we stood by each other.
We trusted each other.

2475
03:00:38,078 --> 03:00:39,841
<i>¡Orale! That's
worth believing in!</i>

2476
03:00:39,914 --> 03:00:41,882
<i>Shit, we were familia,
homes.</i>

2477
03:00:41,949 --> 03:00:46,443
And never again, Cruzito.
Miklo and I are finished, man.

2478
03:00:46,520 --> 03:00:49,819
<i>He ain't my family!
I hate that fuckin' puto!</i>

2479
03:00:49,890 --> 03:00:52,201
You oughta scrape his ass
off the wall like dirt.

2480
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:56,700
<i>Chale, vato. No matter how much hate there is
between you and him, you're still connected.</i>

2481
03:00:57,390 --> 03:01:00,450
You got the same blood pumping
through both your hearts, ese.

2482
03:01:00,514 --> 03:01:02,378
That's a bond
you can never break.

2483
03:01:02,449 --> 03:01:05,247
Neither can Miklo.

2484
03:01:05,272 --> 03:01:07,088
He's still just trying
to be like you!

2485
03:01:07,119 --> 03:01:09,766
<i>- That's bullshit!
- ¡Simon, ese! Come on!</i>

2486
03:01:09,791 --> 03:01:12,692
<i>¡El Gallo Negro!
The baddest Chicano in the barrio!</i>

2487
03:01:12,734 --> 03:01:15,726
Yeah, well, that ain't me!
Not anymore.

2488
03:01:18,828 --> 03:01:20,762
You ain't changed
a bit, ese.

2489
03:01:21,657 --> 03:01:23,625
Oh, so what?
What are you saying?

2490
03:01:23,655 --> 03:01:25,919
It's all my fault the way
everything turned out?

2491
03:01:38,542 --> 03:01:40,533
Oh, I see.

2492
03:01:47,348 --> 03:01:49,441
<i>Orale.</i>

2493
03:01:50,117 --> 03:01:53,018
What, you think you got
so much fucking power, huh?

2494
03:01:55,689 --> 03:01:58,954
<i>You control everybody's
destiny? Chale.</i>

2495
03:02:01,662 --> 03:02:04,722
- No, you're right, man. I set Miklo up.
- No, I'm not.

2496
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:08,200
I made him go after Spider.
I started the whole fuckin' thing.

2497
03:02:08,269 --> 03:02:10,897
Relax, ese.

2498
03:02:10,971 --> 03:02:13,838
Your back wouldn't be all fucked up.

2499
03:02:13,908 --> 03:02:17,605
- Miklo wouldn't be in prison. He'd still have his leg.
- Hey, I forgive you, ese.

2500
03:02:17,678 --> 03:02:20,044
I don't want
your forgiveness, man!

2501
03:02:22,083 --> 03:02:26,383
You know, that's your fuckin' problem,
ese. You can't forgive yourself.

2502
03:02:29,256 --> 03:02:32,020
You need that guilt.
It's what keeps you going.

2503
03:02:32,093 --> 03:02:36,359
Hey, I know, bro. I fed mine
through a needle for ten years.

2504
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:43,201
<i>And that guero up there, hating
his own fuckin' white skin?</i>

2505
03:02:43,270 --> 03:02:45,932
Shit, he's got it worse
than both of us.

2506
03:02:48,642 --> 03:02:53,204
<i>You gotta cut it loose, carnal.
It's fucking poison!</i>

2507
03:02:54,815 --> 03:02:56,942
That's who we are.

2508
03:02:57,017 --> 03:03:00,885
<i>Three vatos locos
full of carnalismo,</i>

2509
03:03:00,955 --> 03:03:03,904
trying to survive
in a fuckin' war zone.

2510
03:03:04,234 --> 03:03:09,900
<i>But what I know now, bro, is that I need
my familia to do it. We all do.</i>

2511
03:03:12,032 --> 03:03:16,227
<i>Even you, ¡pinche jura!
Badass cop.</i>

2512
03:03:16,297 --> 03:03:18,361
Hey, don't back away, vato.

2513
03:03:18,625 --> 03:03:21,884
<i>Life's a risk, carnal.
Remember? You said it yourself.</i>

2514
03:03:21,909 --> 03:03:25,633
<i>¡Pues orale!
Step into the ring and throw down, ese.</i>

2515
03:03:25,758 --> 03:03:29,063
You a badass?
Take care of business, homes.

2516
03:03:29,149 --> 03:03:31,314
<i>¡Caiga, puto!</i>

2517
03:03:31,385 --> 03:03:34,286
'Cause we're
from East Los, ese!

2518
03:03:35,456 --> 03:03:38,892
We come out chased
by hounds! Huh?

2519
03:03:41,499 --> 03:03:45,895
<i>Round and round we go,
wearing a pinche rabbit's foot for luck.</i>

2520
03:03:45,966 --> 03:03:48,437
<i>Just ahead of the fuckin'
hounds. ¡Qu'iubo!</i>

2521
03:03:48,492 --> 03:03:50,569
- Ow!
- Yeah!

2522
03:03:50,598 --> 03:03:54,625
<i>¡Que vida es!
Que loca vida, homes.</i>

2523
03:03:59,580 --> 03:04:02,242
<i>¿Pero sabes que, ese?</i>

2524
03:04:03,745 --> 03:04:05,410
<i>Hey.</i>

2525
03:04:05,886 --> 03:04:10,082
We got something better
than a rabbit's foot, homes.

2526
03:04:10,726 --> 03:04:13,524
<i>We've got familia!</i>

2527
03:04:16,041 --> 03:04:18,100
<i>Raza, huey.</i>

2528
03:04:26,570 --> 03:04:30,028
Hmm? You know
what I'm saying, ese?

2529
03:04:30,499 --> 03:04:32,600
<i>Crees mucho,
Gallo Negro.</i>

2530
03:04:32,710 --> 03:04:35,856
You may be bad, but you
can't dance like Smooth Cruz.

2531
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:38,167
<i>¡Orale!
Yo y tu, ese.</i>

2532
03:04:38,192 --> 03:04:41,081
Oh, I see now.
I remember you, vato.

2533
03:04:41,155 --> 03:04:43,214
<i>- ¡Ah! ¡Ay, ay, ay!
- El Gallo Negro, vato.</i>

2534
03:04:43,290 --> 03:04:46,088
<i>- I'm a lover, not a fighter, man.
- Oh, si.</i>

2535
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:49,254
<i>Simon. El merengue
at the Tender Trap '72.</i>

2536
03:04:49,330 --> 03:04:52,993
<i>- Rucas got their hearts broke and I kicked your ass. Pow! Pow!
- Shit!</i>

2537
03:04:53,067 --> 03:04:54,967
Shit, man, I was breakin'
hearts and faces, vato.

2538
03:04:55,035 --> 03:04:59,199
<i>¡Oh, si! Bullshit!
You still can't dance, ese!</i>

2539
03:04:59,273 --> 03:05:02,401
<i>You still can't dance.
¿Y que, loco?</i>

2540
03:05:02,476 --> 03:05:05,343
<i>Yeah, but you can learn, ese.
I'll teach you. Simon.</i>

2541
03:05:05,412 --> 03:05:08,297
'Cause it ain't ever over,
homes. Never!

2542
03:05:08,356 --> 03:05:11,120
<i>Bailamos hasta que
nos morimos, ese.</i>

2543
03:05:11,175 --> 03:05:13,200
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

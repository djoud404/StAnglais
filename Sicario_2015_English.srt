1
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,007
Get down! Get down!

2
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,127
Don't move!

3
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,686
FBI! Don't move!

4
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,561
Get down! Get down!

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,451
Where are the hostages?
Where are the hostages?

6
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,882
- FBI, Police! Don't move!
- Down! Stay down!

7
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,043
Cross your legs!
Cross your legs and put your hands in the air!

8
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,282
Police! Don't move!
Police! Don't move!

9
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,124
Get down! Get down!

10
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,287
- Clear!
- Police! Search warrant. Don't move!

11
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,320
- Steppin' out!
- Police, don't move!

12
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,049
Police, don't move! Search warrant!

13
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,246
FBI!

14
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,287
Are you hit?

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,447
I'm good.

16
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Fuck!

17
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,445
Front room, clear!

18
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,451
Team leader! Status?

19
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,085
- Front clear!
- We're clear, ma'am!

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,845
Two suspects in custody!

21
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,605
- You okay, Macer?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,047
Why'd he shoot? There's no one here.

23
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,966
Whoa.

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,564
What the fuck?

25
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,366
Jesus!

26
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,090
Those weren't our hostages.

27
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,521
No. That was something else.

28
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,561
- Macer?
- Yeah?

29
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,927
U.S. Attorney wants a statement.
What do you want me to say to her?

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,081
The truth.

31
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,204
Looks like Sonora...

32
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,407
Yeah.

33
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,801
How many total?

34
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,002
We've got 15 in this hall here,
about 20 in the back bedroom.

35
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,050
We haven't even checked the attic
or under the crawl space.

36
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,242
Call DOJ, let 'em know what we have.

37
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,924
This one of the houses
owned by Manuel Diaz?

38
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,641
No way to connect him, but he owns it.

39
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,561
Jesus Christ.

40
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,208
Reg, step out. It's okay.

41
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,048
Vickers! I need bolt cutters!

42
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,281
Vickers!

43
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,525
PD found something.

44
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,846
Relax.

45
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,681
Relax.

46
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,610
<i>Such a heavy body count</i>

47
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,841
<i>this close to Phoenix</i>

48
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,562
<i>is without a doubt a major escalation
for the cartels.</i>

49
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>There will be pressure in Washington
to explain how such a dramatic outrage</i>

50
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,008
<i>could happen so deep inside
the American heartland.</i>

51
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,727
<i>We may be talking about the victims
of a turf war</i>

52
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,404
<i>or maybe some illegal immigrants</i>

53
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,925
<i>who are tied to a ransom,</i>

54
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,570
<i>but it will be some weeks</i>

55
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,007
<i>before we have a clearer picture
on who the victims...</i>

56
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,251
What's goin' on?

57
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,727
I have no idea.

58
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,610
She's been leading
our kidnap response team for three years.

59
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,127
Put her through the grinder since
she got here, and she hasn't blinked.

60
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,731
She's in the front line.

61
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,770
Nobody's gonna be happier than Kate
to see these guys go down.

62
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,564
So she's a thumper.

63
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,881
Today was her fifth O.I.S.

64
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,883
5-and-0, not bad for a rookie.

65
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,325
She never worked cases?

66
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,368
Been kicking doors since day one.

67
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,529
I like her already. What about the partner?
He seen any action?

68
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,409
He's only been with us 18 months.

69
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,891
What's his background?

70
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,849
He's a sharp kid.

71
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,048
ROTC scholarship to Maryland,

72
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,169
did a tour in Iraq,
got his law degree from UNC.

73
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,807
He's green, but he's good.

74
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,884
No lawyers on this train.
Just give me the girl.

75
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,451
We did this by the book, right?

76
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,249
Come on, of course.

77
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,324
- Jesus.
- What?

78
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,440
Oh, shit.

79
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,760
Would you step in here, Kate?

80
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,641
Quite a find today,
the loss of two officers notwithstanding.

81
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,081
Yes, sir.

82
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,530
How familiar are you
with Manuel Diaz's operation?

83
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,641
His company, Sun Oasis,
has 80 or so foreclosure properties.

84
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,366
He has other legitimate businesses. Um...

85
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,649
But he's rumored to be linked
with one of the Mexican cartels.

86
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,971
Manuel Diaz works
for the Sonora Cartel.

87
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,561
He's most likely their senior member
in the United States.

88
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,041
What do you know about his brother?

89
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,730
I wasn't aware he had one.

90
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,770
Guillermo. His brother's name is Guillermo.

91
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,285
Do you know anything about his cousin?

92
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,647
I didn't know he had one of those either.
None of that is in his file.

93
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,643
His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.

94
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,205
I don't know who that is.

95
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,089
No one does. He's off the grid.

96
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,040
He's number three
in the Sonora Cartel.

97
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,490
This is not my department, sir.

98
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,171
Like I said,
Agent Macer doesn't work narcotics.

99
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,442
She runs a kidnap response team.

100
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,881
Are you married?

101
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,525
Am I married?

102
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,529
Do you have a husband?

103
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,080
Divorced.

104
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,406
Kids?

105
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,681
No.

106
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,251
Anything else?

107
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,928
No. Thanks, Kate.
If you could wait outside, please.

108
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,485
- Well?
- I have no clue.

109
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,442
Who are those people?
You know?

110
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,765
No idea.

111
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,765
Thanks for coming in, guys.

112
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,006
Will you come back in, Kate?

113
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,766
DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels
involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz.

114
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,164
This is Matt Graver.
He'll be leading the team.

115
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,881
Isn't this Phoenix homicide now?

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,368
No, we're expanding
the scope of the investigation a bit.

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,365
You'll act as a liaison.

118
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,487
What does that mean?

119
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,127
They need an agent
with tactical experience, like you.

120
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,487
State Department is pulling
an agent from the field

121
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,723
that specializes in responding
to escalated cartel activity.

122
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,202
You'll be part of the team.

123
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,085
You'll meet up with them
at Luke, uh, tomorrow?

124
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,406
Day after. Early.

125
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,481
Air Force Base?

126
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, we're gonna go see Guillermo.

127
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,326
Diaz's brother?

128
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,811
That's the one.

129
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,441
Where is he?

130
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,923
Uh, he's in the El Paso area.

131
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
What's our objective?

132
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,969
To dramatically overreact.

133
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,329
Kate, you must volunteer
for an inter-agency task force.

134
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,167
Think very hard before you respond.

135
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,884
You wanna be a part of this?

136
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,163
Do we get an opportunity
at the men responsible for today?

137
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,890
The men who were really
responsible for today, yeah.

138
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,450
I'll volunteer.

139
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,840
Papa!

140
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,207
Hmm.

141
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,566
<i>Sí.</i>

142
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,441
No.

143
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,444
You keep an eye
on that doughy prick

144
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,601
with the flip-flops.

145
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,681
Don't trust him.

146
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,006
How you doin', sir?

147
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
I.D.'s?

148
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,009
She's on the list, but you're not.

149
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,161
Well, what's she supposed to do?

150
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,486
I need you to turn this around for me.

151
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,045
It's fine. It's good.

152
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,291
I'll call you when we're headed back.

153
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,600
All right.

154
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,764
- Morning.
- Morning. Am I late?

155
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,286
No, no, no. We just landed.
Come on, this way.

156
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,611
My bird dog over there, Alejandro.

157
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,847
Are we taking this?

158
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,082
Yeah. Only the best for you.

159
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,331
DOD flies you around in private jets now?

160
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,970
Yeah. You guys don't have one of these?

161
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,246
Right.

162
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,969
Is there any food on this flight?

163
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,447
Uh, there's some bitchin'
peanuts in the back.

164
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,682
But it's kind of a self-serve deal.

165
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,171
Kate Macer.

166
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,605
Have you been to Juárez before?

167
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,561
Uh...

168
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,883
No, I... We're goin' to El Paso, right?

169
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,163
Yeah, amazing. Okay.

170
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,011
Are you okay?

171
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,609
Yeah. I'm fine.

172
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,366
So, um...

173
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,685
So this is your specialty?

174
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,366
Hmm?

175
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,171
The cartels in Mexico are your specialty?

176
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,442
Yeah. Yeah.

177
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,605
Is there anything I should know?

178
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,126
Uh, you're asking me how a watch works.

179
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,886
For now, let's just keep
an eye on the time.

180
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,806
Okay.

181
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,167
How you doin'?

182
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,004
Howdy! How you been?

183
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,168
Good, buddy. How you feelin'?

184
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,761
Well, when I pee, it burns.

185
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,125
Maybe it's gonorrhea.

186
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,284
What color is it?

187
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,528
Yellow with red specks.

188
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,085
Red specks or blood?

189
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,848
I'm tryin' to get DOD to let me
look into this conspiracy to sink Fiji.

190
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,126
- Fiji?
- Yeah.

191
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,804
Leave Fiji alone, terrorists!

192
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,928
Yeah. Exactly.
I figure a month or two over there,

193
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,525
we'll get it all worked out.

194
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,125
So who's goin' over there today?

195
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,481
Marshals, DEA...
I pulled a team for you, Matt.

196
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,166
Oh, man, I love it when you say "a team."
it makes me all warm and fuzzy.

197
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,608
Oh, they're a crack bunch, too.
Just rotated back from Afghanistan.

198
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,967
Wow. Where's everybody linking up?

199
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,485
A.I.C.

200
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,804
Good, good, good.

201
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,770
Mexican Federal Police
will meet you at the border

202
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,969
and proceed with you to the courthouse,
located here.

203
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,722
This is a high-level target.

204
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,810
The most likely spots for an attempt
will be at the exchange

205
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,406
and at the border crossing on the return.

206
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,925
The Marshals will enter...

207
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,443
Kevin, Keith, you wanna stand up?

208
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,561
Now, the Marshals' response team
is in Laredo...

209
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,721
Love Texans.

210
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,761
So our friends from Delta
have volunteered to come along

211
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,531
and will escort the Marshals
on the exchange.

212
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,924
And here's the man of the hour.

213
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,931
You comin' with or waitin' here?

214
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,646
We'll take the tour with you.
Loan us a couple pop guns.

215
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,848
All right, this is turning
into an all-star affair!

216
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,729
Keith, you want another hand
on the exchange?

217
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,801
You sober?

218
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,204
Will be by the time we get there.

219
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,807
Got a bottle in the truck
in case your hands get shaky.

220
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,450
I know I could always
count on you, Keith.

221
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,522
All right, we'll gear you up
as soon as we're done here.

222
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,844
Now, Matt, you can be the tip of the spear,
and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta.

223
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,922
Now, be careful on the turnaround.

224
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,560
If the Federale's a shooter,
it's gonna happen on the turnaround.

225
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,328
Delta's Team One will be the lead vehicle.

226
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,610
We can divide Team Two between the
carry car and the trail vehicle. That okay?

227
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,364
Good. Now, Delta,
if you can identify yourselves

228
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,807
so everyone knows who to hide behind
if shit hits the fan.

229
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,682
The most likely spot for a hit will be
at the border crossing on the return.

230
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,405
Anywhere along the way, anyone not
in this room is a potential shooter.

231
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,560
The op isn't over until we get back here.

232
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,481
Okay?

233
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,284
Be alert. Be vigilant.
And be aware. Let's go.

234
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,120
What?

235
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,170
Hey! I thought you were in prison.

236
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
They took me out.

237
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,600
They needed somebody for this job.

238
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,927
For good behavior or bad behavior?

239
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,450
Have you ever been over there?

240
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,884
I worked in Juárez.

241
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,525
For the DEA?

242
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,481
No.

243
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,166
For who?

244
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,526
For Mexico.

245
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,484
I was a prosecutor.

246
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,170
You're not American?

247
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
No.

248
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,930
Who do you work for now?

249
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,204
Oh, I go where I'm sent.

250
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,205
Where were you sent from?

251
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,211
Cartagena.

252
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,765
Colombia.

253
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,681
Listen...

254
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,650
Nothing will make sense
to your American ears.

255
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,608
And you will doubt everything that we do.

256
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,083
But in the end,

257
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,845
you will understand.

258
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,527
Here, try this on. See if it fits.

259
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,968
Is he CIA? Are you?

260
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,924
He's a DOD advisor, just like me.

261
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,366
No, he's not.

262
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,410
Just pay attention to Alejandro
and if he says to do somethin', just do it.

263
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,721
I'm not authorized to follow orders
from Alejandro!

264
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,166
Especially in Mexico!

265
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,571
Fine. Then stay here.

266
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,806
But you don't want to, do you?

267
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,723
I just wanna know what I'm getting into.

268
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,209
Kate, you volunteered to get on this train
because you know

269
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,248
you're doing nothing in Phoenix.

270
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah, you're just sweeping up
a fucking mess.

271
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,766
In six months, every single house you raid
will be rigged with explosives.

272
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,320
Do you want to find the guys responsible?
Yes or no?

273
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,401
Yes.

274
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,641
- Yes?
- Yes!

275
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,483
This is where we start.

276
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,571
Try it on.

277
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,011
There she is.

278
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,971
The beast.

279
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,811
Juárez.

280
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,126
You know,

281
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,560
1900s, President Taft
went to visit President Diaz.

282
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,208
Took 4,000 men with him.

283
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,088
And it almost was called off.

284
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,049
Some guy had a pistol.

285
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,249
Was gonna walk right up to Taft
and just blow his brains out.

286
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,563
But it was avoided. 4,000 troops!

287
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,762
Think he felt safe?

288
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,529
Welcome to Juárez.

289
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,331
It's brilliant what they do.

290
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,843
When they mutilate a body like that,

291
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,809
they make people think
they must have been involved,

292
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,282
they must have deserved such a death
'cause they did something.

293
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,004
Oh, it's brilliant what they do.

294
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,406
You hear that?

295
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,645
Those aren't firecrackers.

296
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,810
<i>Mexicans are adjusting our route.</i>

297
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,803
<i>There's activity ahead,
we need to go around.</i>

298
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,041
<i>Everyone hold on.</i>

299
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,249
Nothing will happen here.

300
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,924
They try anything,
it will be at the border.

301
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,367
Keep an eye out for the State Police.

302
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,522
They're not always the good guys.

303
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,564
Spotter vehicle, left lane. Left lane!

304
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,600
<i>Spotter vehicle, nine o'clock.</i>

305
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,450
I'm gettin' a boner.

306
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,010
<i>Is that one of ours?</i>

307
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,809
Watch the right, watch the right.

308
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,491
<i>No, that's a lone wolf.</i>

309
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,011
<i>Eyes on rooftops.</i>

310
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,481
<i>Nothing.</i>

311
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,165
<i>Rooftops clear.</i>

312
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,008
<i>Bridge is one klick out.</i>

313
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,401
<i>Road is clear. Hotfoot it, gentlemen.</i>

314
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,720
<i>Everyone stay in this lane.
Our agents at the border are</i>

315
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,286
<i>waving traffic through
to get us over as quickly as they can.</i>

316
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,690
<i>Everyone stay frosty.</i>

317
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,447
<i>Okay, it's a fuck-up.
What are we gonna do now?</i>

318
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,523
<i>Here's the deal,
a car broke down up ahead.</i>

319
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,847
<i>It's being sorted out,
but it's gonna take a while. Stand by.</i>

320
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,165
Get your service weapon out.

321
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,884
Red Impala, two lanes over, on my ten.

322
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,362
Copy that. Red Impala, two lanes left.

323
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,241
<i>Roger that.</i>

324
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,523
<i>Three lanes left. Seven o'clock.
Green Civic.</i>

325
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,850
Bring your window down.

326
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,086
Gun.

327
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,004
Gun. Gun left!

328
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,280
<i>What are the rules here?</i>

329
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,681
<i>We must be engaged to engage.</i>

330
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,284
<i>Permission to get out of the vehicle
and set a perimeter?</i>

331
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,801
<i>Stay in your vehicle.</i>

332
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,690
<i>You can do what they do.
If they get out, you get out.</i>

333
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,891
<i>Get ready.
They can see our lane clearing.</i>

334
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,405
<i>If it's coming, it's coming now.</i>

335
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,329
<i>- Move!</i>
- Wait, wait, wait.

336
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,441
Get outta the car.

337
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,446
Jesus Christ!

338
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,440
Don't move! <i>Cálmate!</i>

339
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,166
No, no, no, no!

340
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,931
What the fuck are we doing?

341
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,481
Fuck!

342
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,244
Lane's clear! The lane's clear!

343
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,481
Don't look at me!

344
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,281
Put your hands behind your head! Go!
Hands behind your head!

345
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,040
- All clear!
- I got this!

346
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,770
Go, go, go!

347
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,490
Move, move, move!

348
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,610
<i>This is gonna be on the front page</i>

349
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,250
<i>of every newspaper in America.</i>

350
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,722
No, it won't.
It won't even make the papers in El Paso.

351
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,087
Clear!

352
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,451
Come here.

353
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,525
Got a little nutty, huh?

354
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,490
Nutty? Yeah.
Yeah, that was fucking illegal.

355
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,530
You wanna start a war?
You're a fucking spook!

356
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,961
And him! I mean, who the fuck is that?

357
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
Told you, you could stay here.

358
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,329
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
You just spray bullets at...

359
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,687
Yeah, sure there's just
fucking civilians everywhere.

360
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,410
I'm not a soldier! This is not what I do!

361
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,165
Whoa! Don't sell yourself short, all right?

362
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,369
The reason Reggie's home is
I know he wasn't ready for this.

363
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,882
But he better get ready real quick
because this is the future, Kate!

364
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,440
Juárez is what happens when they dig in.
This is it!

365
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,521
What am I doing here?

366
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,881
What you're doing here is
you're giving us the opportunity

367
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,684
to shake the tree and create chaos.

368
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,046
That's what this is!

369
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,209
In the meantime,
just sponge everything up you see.

370
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,442
Learn! That's why you're here.

371
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,130
Guillermo...

372
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,490
You're giving him a belly full of water,
you devil.

373
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,362
You didn't think
we'd get you here, did you?

374
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,806
<i>No hablo Inglés.</i>

375
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,769
<i>No hablo Inglés?</i>

376
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,847
I love it when they <i>no hablo Inglés.</i>

377
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,406
You know, I brought an old buddy of yours.

378
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,688
I bet you <i>hablo</i> to him. Yeah.

379
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,887
I didn't know ghosts got thirsty.

380
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,846
I know someone kept him alive for us.

381
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,364
I doubt it was easy.

382
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,003
What's easy these days?

383
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,087
I'm sorry about
what happened on the return.

384
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,889
I control only what I can.

385
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,124
It's not your fault.

386
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,887
<i>Sí.</i>

387
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,563
There's rumors of a tunnel.

388
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,526
Fausto's main road into Arizona.

389
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,881
If you're doing what I think you're doing,
that's the best place to cross.

390
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,169
If you can find it.
But time is against you.

391
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,370
In three days,
nobody will be where they are today.

392
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,966
Shall we?

393
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,281
No, it's better if you don't.

394
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,328
Something happens in that room,

395
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,249
it's easier to say you didn't see anything.

396
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,971
Aw, Alejandro, I think he remembers you.

397
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,084
I'm gonna step out.

398
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,491
Timmy.

399
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,528
What do you keep lookin' at me for?

400
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,362
<i>No hablo Inglés,</i> remember?

401
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,850
No, no.

402
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,090
Can I have one of those?

403
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,080
Thank you.

404
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,204
- You like fireworks?
- Huh?

405
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,250
Wanna see something cool?

406
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,960
Come on.

407
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,087
Here we go.

408
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,771
Look right there.

409
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,125
Unbelievable.

410
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,050
That's what happens
when you chop the head off a chicken.

411
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,804
Yeah.

412
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,690
I can see.

413
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,407
Can you get 'em all in one place?

414
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,484
We just landed back in Phoenix.
I'm on a clock, I can't wait.

415
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,366
All right, look, contact Bob Fisks.

416
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,249
Have him hold 'em in the staging area.

417
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,448
Yeah. How long does it
take to get to Tucson?

418
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,488
Um, from here
it's a little over two hours.

419
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,404
All right.
We'll be there around 2:00. Yeah.

420
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,931
Are we going to Tucson?

421
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,162
Yeah, you gotta learn
how to sleep on a plane.

422
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,050
They let me on the base
when you need a ride, don't they?

423
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,121
You okay?

424
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,800
- She's fine.
- I didn't ask you.

425
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,330
And yet I answered.

426
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,006
Kate,

427
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,447
who's that?

428
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,364
We're goin' to Tucson.

429
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,965
What's the deal, Matt?
Why you holdin' up my transport?

430
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,360
Don't worry, Bob. We'll be quick.

431
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,004
How's the auditor gonna react to

432
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,845
an $8,000 check to fuckin' Domino's Pizza?

433
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,571
Don't be so dramatic, okay?
This is Kate Macer with the FBI.

434
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,330
This is her partner, what's-his-name.
It was her call.

435
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,569
Yeah, it wasn't my call.
Have you got another one of those?

436
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,404
Finish it before you get up there.

437
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,766
No problem.

438
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,926
Hey, Kate.

439
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,768
Tell me what happened in El Paso.

440
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,442
We weren't in El Paso. We were in Mexico.

441
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,807
I guess we're not
following any procedures.

442
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,211
What do you wanna do?

443
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,767
We want to talk to the people
caught around the Nogales area.

444
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,769
Okay. That group.

445
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,050
This group here. And that group.

446
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,046
Okay. They stay and the rest can go.

447
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,971
Josef!

448
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,164
On the bus. <i>Ándale.</i>

449
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,523
What are we looking for?

450
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,445
Just keep watching.

451
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,923
- In Arizona.
- Arizona.

452
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,121
<i>Sí.</i>

453
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,561
No?

454
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,889
- Arizona.
- Arizona...

455
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,370
Talk to me. What are we doing?

456
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,010
I don't have any answers for you.

457
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,406
Let's get some, then.

458
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,050
Do you think
I haven't asked these questions?

459
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,121
Do you think you can do better?

460
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,201
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

461
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,203
Matt, can we talk for a minute?

462
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,685
What's up?

463
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,330
Everything okay?

464
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,330
You look very serious.

465
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,604
There's "in the dark"
and there's the way you're treating us.

466
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,762
I want to know the objective
or I walk, period.

467
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,963
Then go. I didn't ask you to be here.
She did.

468
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,605
I walk, too.

469
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,207
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

470
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,691
Fuckin' lawyers.

471
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,845
All right.

472
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,520
Guillermo

473
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,682
told us about a tunnel east of Nogales,
near Sasabe.

474
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,762
Now we're tryin' to find out
what areas near there migrants avoid

475
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,604
so we can find the tunnel.

476
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,767
That better?

477
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,841
And Guillermo is...

478
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,922
Guillermo, he just told you
where the drug tunnel is?

479
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,047
He just told you?

480
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,770
Guillermo didn't have any other options.

481
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,922
We send him back across the border,
he's a dead man.

482
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,049
Now he gets to spend the next 30 years
in an American prison,

483
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,606
In relative safety.

484
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,523
Just tell us the truth, man.

485
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,241
We are gonna make enough noise

486
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,802
that Manuel Diaz is called back
to Mexico to see his boss.

487
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,765
That's the truth.

488
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,126
And then?

489
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,881
And then we know where his boss is.

490
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,288
His name is Fausto Alarcon. <i>El Verdugo.</i>

491
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,250
Every day across that border,

492
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,048
people are kidnapped or killed
by his hand or with his blessing.

493
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,969
To find him would be like
discovering a vaccine.

494
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,730
You understand the value of that.

495
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,208
All right, we're good.
Just don't keep us in the dark.

496
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,521
Great!

497
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,289
You afraid of the dark?

498
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,727
Hey!

499
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,807
It's been a humdinger of a day.
Go home. Get some rest.

500
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,611
We'll find our own ride.
We'll see you tomorrow!

501
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,883
I just drove a hundred fucking miles.

502
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,849
It's a fucking blessing, trust me.

503
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,001
Got you smokin' again?

504
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,081
Yeah.

505
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,569
Who the fuck's Guillermo?

506
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,689
Gotta get you a new bra, woman.

507
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,684
The list of things I need.

508
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,842
I'm just saying, you know.
Some nice lacy somethin'.

509
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,808
It's been a while since someone's
seen me in a bra, except you.

510
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,011
Oh, God, don't look at me like that.
I don't want your pity.

511
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,282
How was seeing Evan the other day?

512
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,520
I don't know...

513
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,443
- Miss him?
- Ask me something else.

514
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,002
You know,
I used to see guys like Matt in Iraq.

515
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,923
Gotta be careful around these people.

516
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,571
CIA's not supposed to
work this side of the fence.

517
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,051
He's a DOD advisor.

518
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,690
You really believe that?

519
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,964
You need somebody watching your six,
'cause I promise you they aren't.

520
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,326
You know,

521
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,885
we're not even scratching the surface
doing what we're doing.

522
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,486
And they are.

523
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,121
Mmm. Well, you sure picked
the motherfuckers to show us.

524
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,845
What's the password?

525
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,206
Moron.

526
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,206
This is our spot.

527
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,088
No way! No, no.

528
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,564
- Are you getting this?
- Mmm-hmm.

529
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,047
<i>Sí.</i>

530
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,050
That's our way across.

531
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,681
So Guillermo was tellin' the truth.

532
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,844
It's gonna be a good day.

533
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,484
Hey, Kate.
Got any friends at Phoenix SWAT?

534
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,284
Uh, yeah, we use them
in breaches all the time.

535
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,771
Good, 'cause we're gonna need their help.

536
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,887
What for?

537
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,123
We are gonna fuck with
Manuel Diaz's wallet.

538
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,083
This is our Smurf, guys.
Blonde hair, white purse.

539
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,448
- You know the Heimlich?
- Oh, yeah.

540
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,524
She tries to eat that deposit receipt,
you Heimlich it right out of her, hear me?

541
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,840
Copy that.

542
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,009
There she goes.
All right, go get 'em, tiger.

543
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,281
Take 'em.

544
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,366
<i>Get down!</i>

545
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,883
<i>Hold Still! Hold Still!</i>

546
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,804
<i>Whoa!</i>

547
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,000
You want bank computers for evidence?

548
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,884
No, no. Just the money.

549
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,610
But freeze all his accounts, everything.

550
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,081
Even if his dog opened an account,
I want you to freeze it.

551
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,331
What you got?

552
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,203
Got a mobile money launderer.

553
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,041
Pack it up.

554
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,843
Come on. Come on!

555
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,566
You coming?

556
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,687
No, don't go in the bank.

557
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,728
This is something
we can actually build a case on.

558
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,609
Don't go in the bank, Kate!

559
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,409
There you go, and she's goin' in the bank.

560
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,489
These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?

561
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,928
Yeah. Cash deposits made daily
in $9,000 increments.

562
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,282
- So, it doesn't have to be reported.
- That's right.

563
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,646
And you can seize those?

564
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,008
I already have. And I'll go through
these wire transfer numbers and

565
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,048
freeze all these accounts as well.

566
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,161
Here you go.

567
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,890
- Oh, damn, that's smart.
- What?

568
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,689
This is a bank line of credit.

569
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,006
See, you make payments
over what you owe

570
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,323
and it doesn't show up as cash,
it shows up as a negative loan balance.

571
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,006
It's never reported to anyone. IRS, DEA...

572
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,730
This money is invisible.

573
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,160
How much does he have?

574
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,406
Take a look.

575
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,051
Oh, my God.

576
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,844
They just seized $17 million.

577
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,604
- It's a bogus bust, Kate.
- What?

578
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,761
You can't prosecute it.

579
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,683
No one controls who deposits
money in an account.

580
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,489
An attorney will have that money back
in a few months,

581
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,925
but a lot of heads will roll before that.

582
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,651
But we can arrest Manuel for now.
We can get him off the street.

583
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,610
We gotta get Manuel called back to Mexico.
That's the objective.

584
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,409
We have no jurisdiction in Mexico.

585
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,047
We have nothing.
We need to do something now.

586
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,451
Can't arrest him.

587
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,291
What?

588
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,601
When?

589
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,605
Wait a minute.

590
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,965
Mmm-hmm.

591
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,890
$9,000 is deposited into this account
every day, in cash,

592
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,121
for five years.

593
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,410
It's not illegal.
It's suspect, but it isn't illegal.

594
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,323
I think the IRS might think it's illegal.

595
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,289
What do you want, Kate?
What would you like done here?

596
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,806
I want to follow
some semblance of procedure.

597
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,042
That's what I want.
To build a prosecutable case.

598
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,522
We prosecuted more felony drug cases
in this region last year

599
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,206
than in the two previous years combined.

600
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,641
Are you feeling that on the street?

601
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,681
You getting the vibe that we're winning?

602
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,324
No.

603
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,970
Do you?

604
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,925
No, sir, I don't.

605
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,130
Advisors like Matt come in,
they stir the pot,

606
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,851
they cause the criminals
to react and make mistakes.

607
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,407
That's how we build cases
against the individuals

608
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,562
that actually make a
difference in this fight.

609
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,889
It's when they're nervous,
when they stop trusting their crews,

610
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,928
when they move their money.

611
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,889
These are all opportunities to strike.

612
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,121
And that's the purpose of people like Matt.

613
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,403
Kate, this isn't something
that I dreamed up myself.

614
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,963
I don't have the authority to hire advisors

615
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,691
or authorize joint agency missions,

616
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,286
or fly agents from Air Force bases.

617
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,522
Are you understanding me?

618
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,683
These decisions are made far from here

619
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,801
by officials elected to office,
not appointed to them.

620
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,964
So if your fear is operating out of bounds,

621
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,089
I am telling you, you are not.

622
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,643
The boundary's been moved.

623
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,931
Are we clear?

624
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,690
Yes, sir.

625
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,490
I need a fucking drink.

626
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,767
- Where you wanna go?
- Anywhere.

627
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,166
I'm gonna go get a table.

628
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,129
- I guess it's on me.
- Thanks.

629
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,288
- What'll it be?
- Two beers.

630
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,721
Thank you.

631
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,608
I want a cigarette so bad.

632
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,969
Macer?

633
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,970
Yeah?

634
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,208
I hate to go on about this,

635
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,680
but I think the bra situation's
the least of your problems.

636
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,807
Okay...

637
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,763
'Cause you look like shit.

638
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,929
You do. You look like shit.
Everybody on the team's talkin' about it.

639
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,441
They're like, "Kate used to be
a number one draft pick.

640
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,360
"Now look at her.
She looks like fuckin' shit."

641
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,363
Look at you. Your eyebrows are a mess.

642
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,601
No, they're not!

643
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,160
They're like caterpillars, like wild beasts.
You're losing weight...

644
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,241
I'm eating.

645
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,482
Look at you.
What is it, one T-shirt a week?

646
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,131
At least work
on your personal hygiene, huh?

647
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,247
You sound like my mother.

648
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,725
Maybe I am your mother.

649
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,763
First we work on personal hygiene,
then we move on to the shopping.

650
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,571
Get you some potatoes, yeah?
Eat some food...

651
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,642
Where have you taken me?
What is this place?

652
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,966
It's a bar.

653
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,286
It's full of cowboys.

654
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,040
I'm a cowboy.

655
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,241
You're a redneck?

656
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,927
I'm a redneck. Got a trailer. Got a wife.

657
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,161
What are you talking about?

658
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,083
I got a trailer, I got a wife.
She's my sister.

659
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,041
Big Reg.

660
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,129
- Ted!
- What's goin' on, man?

661
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,202
- Long time. How you been?
- Yeah, it's good to see you, man.

662
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,441
Good to see you, too.
How you been?

663
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,681
Gettin' your groove on, huh?

664
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,285
No, man. We just started. We just got here.

665
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,964
All right. You, uh...

666
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,530
- Gonna introduce me, man?
- Oh.

667
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,648
Ted, Phoenix PD, Kate, my partner.

668
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,960
How you doin'? Just Ted's fine.

669
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,042
I saw you play softball once.

670
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,929
Softball?

671
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,969
She was at the game, Ted.

672
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,280
"The game?"

673
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,361
Aw...

674
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,044
Where you struck out
in slow-pitch softball.

675
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,730
You played really, really well.

676
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,847
Yeah, I appreciate that.

677
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,681
I'm gonna head back to that bar now.
Well, can I get y'all another round?

678
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,166
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

679
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,407
All right.

680
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,925
Ted, he's a good guy.

681
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,280
Mmm-hmm.

682
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,251
Divorced.

683
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,162
Just give me one second,
I'll be right with you.

684
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,326
All right...

685
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,245
Just wait, wait, wait a second...

686
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,368
What, what, what? Is that too much?

687
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,363
Just wait one minute.
I just need a second.

688
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,488
All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

689
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,406
Hey, Kate?

690
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,041
Hey! Hey, come here, stop, stop, talk to me.

691
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,040
Just talk to me. Okay?
Relax. Okay? Just take it...

692
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,122
Whoa, shit! Kate...

693
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,124
What is it? What? Stop.

694
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,209
Stop. Stop.

695
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,404
Shit, what the fuck is wrong with you?

696
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,923
- Don't...
- What the fuck are you...

697
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,564
Goddamn!

698
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,767
You fuckin' try to shoot me?
You fuckin' crazy?

699
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,645
- Stop that!
- Get off me!

700
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,367
Fuck that...

701
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,243
Damn it, Kate! Just fucking stop!

702
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,721
Stop!

703
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,045
Stop, bitch! Stop! Fuck!

704
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,723
Fuckin' stop!

705
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,643
Stop. Shh.

706
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,687
Fuck!

707
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,845
This is you, you hear me?
You did this. You did this.

708
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,681
Psst!

709
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,484
You used me as bait.

710
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,126
Nah, you used yourself as bait.

711
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,969
I told you not to go in the bank.

712
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,729
You brought him back here, though.
That was smart.

713
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,644
Yeah. Love how we're gonna
pretend like I planned this.

714
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,610
Why don't you just write
that in your report.

715
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,728
Come on! This is good news!

716
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,207
They're gonna call Manuel back soon.

717
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,010
Isn't that the point?

718
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,410
It's okay, Reg.

719
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,200
I thought he was a friend.

720
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,441
I know.

721
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,251
- Want me to stay tonight?
- No. I'm good.

722
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,164
- You sure?
- I'm good.

723
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,245
How y'all want me to talk to you
when you keep fuckin' hittin' me?

724
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,204
How many other corrupt motherfuckers are
you workin' with on this side of the border?

725
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,487
All right. Look...

726
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,685
It's exactly what I told you, all right?
They just...

727
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,643
They came to me
and they wanted details about our case

728
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,167
and, yes, I did it. I gave it to them,
but I never wanted anybody to get hurt.

729
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,044
I would never gotten involved
with them pieces of shit

730
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,121
if I thought that there was any...

731
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,766
Ahh! Fuck! Okay!

732
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,842
Okay! Fuck! Okay!

733
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,602
"Okay, okay, okay,"
is not what we're lookin' for, Ted.

734
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,564
You know what the beauty is
of you being so beat to a pulp?

735
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,287
'Cause no one's gonna notice
a few more scratches.

736
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,210
This is a new deal, Ted.

737
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,641
I'm the one who decides whether
your daughter'll get Federal protection...

738
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,801
Aw, fuck...

739
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,963
Or whether we post your ex-wife's
address on the Internet.

740
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,287
I decide whether you go to prison
in a work camp in Missouri,

741
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,045
or a kill house like Corcoran.

742
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,526
All right.

743
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,765
This is where you negotiate
how to survive, my friend.

744
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,847
Okay. Look...

745
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,887
I feel like this whole thing's
just gotten away from me...

746
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,402
I fucked up. Okay, I fucked up
and I'm in over my fuckin' head right now.

747
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,441
I'm sorry... Ahh!

748
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,330
Fuck! Get it out! Get it the fuck out!

749
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,681
Fuck! Get it the fuck out! Get it out!

750
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,281
Motherfucker! And fuck you!

751
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,841
Fuck!

752
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,131
How many officers
do they have working on the force?

753
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,283
I'll tell you everything you wanna know.

754
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,762
You just gotta promise me that
my daughter's gonna be safe, okay?

755
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,763
You make me that promise.

756
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,525
You want the truth?

757
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,046
Please.

758
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,091
Give me all the names

759
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,885
of all the motherfuckers
they got working on the force.

760
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,411
Okay, okay...

761
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,005
- All right?
- Okay...

762
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,728
Okay. So which phone do we start with?

763
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,371
It's in that one. It's that shitty one.

764
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,482
- That's the shitty one?
- Yes, sir!

765
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,370
How you feelin'?

766
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,002
- Better.
- Uh-huh.

767
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:53,642
Well, you should've shot him.

768
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,405
I just tried to have sex with my hitman.

769
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,161
Nah. He's no assassin.

770
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,566
He just wanted to know what you know.

771
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,166
They're after us, not you.

772
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,651
Thank you.

773
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,286
You remind me of someone
very special to me.

774
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,127
Hmm.

775
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,250
Get some rest.

776
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,525
Tomorrow they'll call Manuel Diaz
back to Mexico

777
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,488
and we'll cut a leg from them.

778
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,760
<i>Hello, sixty.</i>

779
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,887
<i>We have eyes on the objective.</i>

780
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,610
<i>Can we get a closer visual?</i>

781
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,960
<i>Ten meters going down east of the ridge.</i>

782
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,047
Papa?

783
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,363
- Football?
<i>- Sí,</i> Papa.

784
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,687
No!

785
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,161
Come on in.

786
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,446
Tasty beverage?

787
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,927
Okay, boys.

788
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,400
What's going on? What's the plan?

789
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,771
We're going hunting.

790
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,650
Looks like Manuel Diaz
is being called back to Mexico.

791
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,449
Just waiting for confirmation.

792
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,171
There's the tunnel right there.

793
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,520
All right, listen up.

794
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,485
Let's clarify the op.

795
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,810
We're gonna drive to location,
proceed on foot...

796
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,689
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

797
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,683
- I'm fine.
- How's the neck?

798
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,160
It's better, thank you.

799
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,925
Good, good.

800
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,406
These diagrams are based on

801
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,920
other tunnels that have been mapped.

802
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,880
They're for reference only,
they're not accurate.

803
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,046
Once on the Mexican side of the border,
there'll be a small staging area,

804
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,288
then another shaft
will lead to the main warehouse

805
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,044
and the road that returns to Mexico.

806
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,003
Once we clear the mules,
we don't expect more than a dozen bandits.

807
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,165
No. They use Mexican police
for vehicle transport.

808
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,084
If you see a uniform in the tunnel,
consider him a bandit, too.

809
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,962
Okay. Uh, you want to discuss ROE?

810
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,971
Nah, we'll save that for later.

811
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,041
Okay.

812
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:27,123
This is an in and out.
We're clearing, placing an agent.

813
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,244
It's all about creating a diversion.

814
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,482
Want the mother
of all diversions, boys.

815
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,450
Need a lot of noise.
Fourth of July on steroids.

816
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,683
All right.
Weapons check. Let's go, boys.

817
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,049
This looks like confirmation.

818
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,641
- I need to fit your guy with a locator.
- Yeah, do it.

819
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,961
Those are Special Ops.
Are we going in on this?

820
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,644
Nah. You guys aren't really dressed for it.

821
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,801
Well, you didn't fuckin' tell us.

822
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,848
Yeah, well, you two went
cryin' to Daddy yesterday, and we

823
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,888
- don't want Daddy to know everything.
- Oh, give me a fucking break!

824
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,200
All right, we'll get you some extra gear.

825
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,685
We have tac gear in the car.

826
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,761
All right. Good.

827
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,251
You guys will hang back
when we get there, okay?

828
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,401
Then why are we going?

829
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,485
'Cause CIA can't operate
within US borders...

830
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,040
Without a domestic agency attached.

831
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,004
I told you you'd be useful.

832
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,648
So that's it. That's why I'm here.

833
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,964
Yeah, that's it.

834
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,245
That's why you're here.

835
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,971
Hey, we find any drugs,
you guys get to confiscate 'em.

836
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,730
It's gonna be a big day.

837
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,125
Un-fucking real!

838
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,970
- Front and back.
- Kate.

839
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,527
Kate, come on. Fuck these people, man.
They've been using us from the beginning.

840
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,761
We don't have to do this.

841
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,205
I need to know what they used us for.

842
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,203
- Doesn't matter what!
- Yes, it does!

843
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,920
I say we walk. We walk and make them
eat this whole fucked-up operation.

844
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,331
No. I have to know.

845
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,808
<i>Black Mercedes...
Plate number, Romeo-India-November</i>

846
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,090
<i>three-one-Bravo-seven.
Heading south by southeast.</i>

847
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,921
<i>Where?</i>

848
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,608
Okay.

849
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,206
We gotta hit the tunnel
the minute we get on the ground.

850
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,085
Pretty exciting, huh?

851
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,165
What is target's location?

852
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,847
<i>14 miles south of Nogales
heading west, rapidly.</i>

853
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,889
Keep your fuckin' safeties on,
barrels pointed down.

854
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,881
Stay in the back.

855
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,610
Don't shoot anyone
on my fuckin' team. Right?

856
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,925
Gear check?

857
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,329
Thermal camera, check.

858
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,970
Night vision goggles, check.

859
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,610
Get those guys.

860
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,091
Wanna take Alpha squad, I'll take B squad?

861
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,561
- You got it. Let's do it.
- Let's go, boys.

862
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,522
Control, you copy?

863
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,011
<i>Roger, Alpha. We read.</i>

864
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,850
<i>Fifty meters.
Your three o'clock, Alpha.</i>

865
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,440
<i>Stand by. Getting close to objective.</i>

866
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,724
<i>Alpha, Bravo, be advised.</i>

867
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,689
<i>12 meters straight ahead.</i>

868
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,480
All right, we need to boogie

869
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,325
and we need to do it quiet
till we find the center.

870
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,921
Draw the fighters to you
and make some noise.

871
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,048
Don't follow me. I'll be fine.

872
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,967
What are the rules of engagement?

873
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,723
Weapons free, my friend.
Weapons free.

874
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,400
Weapons free, boys.

875
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,205
Good luck.

876
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,241
Oh, God!

877
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,251
- You okay?
- My gun!

878
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,409
Leave it. Stay on my six.

879
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:35,921
Freeze!

880
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,530
Step away from him.

881
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,761
Put that down.

882
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,729
I mean it! Move away from him right now!

883
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,922
Don't ever point a weapon at me again.

884
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,521
Catch your breath. Then get back up there.

885
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,810
I am through. Do you have my location?

886
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,004
<i>Roger, we have you.</i>

887
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,003
<i>Target is east and north of you.</i>

888
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,529
<i>Looks like Highway 56 to 17.
Will intercept him if he stays on 17.</i>

889
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,962
<i>Go east on 56 off Highway 2.</i>

890
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,761
Wilco.

891
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,924
Is he through yet?

892
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,721
<i>We have joy.
GPS is transmitting. Audio is transmitting.</i>

893
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,604
<i>Should intercept in 20.</i>

894
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,850
That was a clean,
clean fucking op, my friend.

895
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,002
Except for these two assholes.

896
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,208
Well, you're better overseas.
You don't have to babysit.

897
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,321
Where's Kate?

898
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,520
I thought she was with you.

899
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,921
We gotta go back.

900
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,205
Oh, shit. Boys, we're missin' one.
Let's go.

901
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,521
Hey!

902
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,523
Whoa, whoa!

903
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,526
Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.

904
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,451
Stop. Stop moving.

905
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,563
Get off me!

906
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,290
Stop moving! Stop!

907
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,041
Stop it.

908
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,441
Just relax. Just relax.

909
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,802
All right? You gonna stay there?

910
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,564
Are you gonna stay there?

911
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,007
All right.

912
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,610
Now, you listen.

913
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,088
You went up the wrong tunnel.

914
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,241
You saw things you shouldn't have seen.

915
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,410
What is Medellín?

916
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,845
Medellín?

917
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,642
Medellín refers to a time

918
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,283
when one group controlled
every aspect of the drug trade,

919
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,725
providing a measure of order
that we could control.

920
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:15,567
And until somebody finds a way
to convince 20% of the population

921
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,121
to stop snorting and smoking that shit,

922
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,882
Order's the best we can hope for.

923
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,882
And what you saw up there

924
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,203
was Alejandro working toward
returning that order.

925
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,647
Alejandro works for
the fucking Colombian Cartel.

926
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,563
He works for the competition.

927
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,366
Alejandro works for anyone

928
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,040
who will point him toward
the people who made him.

929
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,603
Us.

930
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:54,886
Them.

931
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,481
Anyone who will turn him loose.

932
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,602
So he can get the person
that cut off his wife's head,

933
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,244
and threw his daughter into a vat of acid.

934
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,326
Yeah.

935
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,842
That's what we're dealing with.

936
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,089
You can't do this.

937
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,885
You can't.

938
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:35,130
I'm sure as shit not the person
you're gonna hide it all behind.

939
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,645
You need to just take a breath.

940
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,131
I'm gonna fuckin' talk.

941
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,964
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

942
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,566
I'm gonna tell everyone what you did.

943
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,841
That would be a major mistake.

944
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,481
Is that the target up ahead? Confirm.

945
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,845
<i>Roger that.
Black Mercedes, 60 meters ahead.</i>

946
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,491
This motherfucker...

947
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,125
Ah!

948
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,486
What happens
when we get to the house?

949
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,801
You'll stop the car, I'll get out.

950
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,725
What will happen to me?

951
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,441
Slow down.

952
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,561
<i>Señor</i> Diaz?

953
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,921
<i>Six remain.</i>

954
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,165
<i>We're going blind.</i>

955
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,166
Hmm?

956
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:31,281
No.

957
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,931
Every night you have families killed.

958
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,604
And yet, here you dine.

959
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,282
Tonight should be no different.

960
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,251
Do you think the people that sent you here

961
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,011
are any different?

962
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,681
Who do you think we learned it from?

963
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,365
The grieving lawyer.

964
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:01,762
Your wife, you think she'd be proud
of what you've become?

965
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,363
Don't forget about my daughter.

966
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,965
Ah, <i>Sí.</i>

967
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,650
Not in front of my boys.

968
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,562
Go ahead and finish your meal.

969
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,925
I would recommend not standing

970
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,128
on balconies for a while, Kate.

971
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,126
Sit down.

972
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,640
You look like a little
girl when you're scared.

973
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,890
You remind me of the daughter
they took away from me.

974
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,366
I need you to sign this piece of paper.

975
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,764
It basically says that everything we did

976
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,849
was done by the book.

977
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,689
I can't sign that.

978
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,206
Sign it.

979
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,809
It's okay.

980
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,445
It's all right.

981
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,810
I can't sign that.

982
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,601
God!

983
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,440
You would be committing suicide, Kate.

984
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,722
Come on. Sign it.

985
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,287
You should move to a small town,

986
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:36,527
where the rule of law still exists.

987
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,607
You will not survive here.

988
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,929
You are not a wolf.

989
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,761
And this is the land of wolves now.

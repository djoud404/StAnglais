1
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,695
What do you know, boys?

2
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,197
Hey, Papi,
get over here.

3
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,656
I got someone
I want you to meet.

4
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,451
Roland Legrand.

5
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,038
Caught this fucking goat
singing like a canary
to the police.

6
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,793
This is what happens
when you cross me.

7
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,462
Get this piece of shit
out of here.

8
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,799
So, what do you
got for me?

9
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,303
Piece of cake,
just like you said.

10
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,555
You pocket any
for yourself?

11
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,850
Yeah, just a couple
of the big ones.

12
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,941
You sure got
some balls on you.

13
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,193
You try to hustle me,

14
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,570
and I'll cut them
the fuck off.

15
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,240
Good for 10,000.

16
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,358
Did you have
a good night?

17
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,068
Yup.
At least you did.

18
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,531
Maybe this'll
cheer you up.

19
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,743
Take it.

20
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,463
It's for you.

21
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,091
A couple of
the big ones for us.

22
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,093
You're crazy.

23
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,806
Where you going?

24
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,349
Castili doesn't want me
leaving early.

25
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,642
To hell with Castili.

26
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,438
Let's go have some fun.

27
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,233
Let's turn that frown
upside down.

28
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,655
I know you want
to have some fun.

29
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,468
/ love you.

30
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,595
Say that again.

31
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,764
Slower.

32
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,810
...love...

33
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,564
...you.

34
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,160
I want a house.

35
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:12,289
In the countryside,
like where you grew up.

36
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,336
You make it sound so nice,
riding our little
horsey around.

37
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,880
Let's go today.

38
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,551
How am I going to earn
in the country?

39
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,178
There's nothing to steal.

40
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,847
We'll get jobs.

41
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,600
I made more last night

42
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,687
than most people
in the country
make in a year.

43
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,064
Give me six months.

44
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,694
I'll be making more money
than Castili
and all those bums.

45
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,871
Hey.

46
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,473
I don't want
to wait six months.

47
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,897
I'm here for the rent.

48
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,444
All right. I'm coming,
I'm coming.

49
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,908
It's him.
What the fuck?

50
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,620
You're under arrest
for the murder of
Roland Legrand.

51
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,912
What are you
talking about?

52
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,289
Well, he was murdered
last night.

53
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,582
A witness
identified you.

54
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,210
The pimp Roland Legrand.
You know him, right?

55
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,214
You got the wrong guy, pal.
I was with her all night.

56
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,424
Come on. Let's go.

57
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,593
All right,
let me get dressed.
No, no, no, no, no.

58
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,262
We got some stripes
at the station for you,
pretty boy.

59
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,722
This is bullshit.
Cuff him.

60
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,182
I didn't kill anyone.
You can't do that.

61
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,351
He was with me.
Nenette, relax.

62
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,603
They got nothing.
Nobody believes a whore.

63
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,812
Nenette!
Get back in your room.

64
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,814
Honestly, I'll be back
in no time.

65
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,693
Papi! Papi!
Don't worry. Don't worry.

66
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,819
Papi!

67
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:09,907
Papi!

68
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:11,950
Papi!

69
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,036
He didn't kill anyone!

70
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,496
He was with me!

71
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,497
Step away from the bars.

72
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,292
I can't believe
they gave you a life sentence.

73
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,131
You need to appeal.

74
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,633
Appeal what?

75
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,554
Nenette,
this is a frame-up.

76
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,889
They're all in on it.

77
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,560
I just need to concentrate
on breaking out.

78
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,478
Okay.

79
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,981
First thing
I'm going to do
when I get back

80
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,607
is Kill that lying
rat witness

81
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,985
and anyone
who has anything
to do with this.

82
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,069
Calm down.

83
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,612
All visitors have to leave.

84
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,032
Nenette, you need
to forget about me.

85
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,619
Don't say that.

86
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,498
I love you.
Time's up, lady.

87
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,041
Papi, I love you.

88
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,711
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

89
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,256
Get your hands off me!
Come on. Come on.

90
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,810
Papillon, right?
They fucked you
good, huh?

91
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,062
Framed you for murder.

92
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,899
Say you're one hell
of a safe cracker.

93
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,027
I'm more of
a smash-and-grab guy
myself. Name's Julot.

94
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,988
Got any money?

95
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,032
No?

96
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,911
Get some.
You'll never escape
without it.

97
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,165
All right. Let's go.

98
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,750
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.

99
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,502
Next. Move forward.
Next. Come on.

100
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,586
Line five.

101
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,796
Let's go, let's go.
Move.

102
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,880
Next.
Next.

103
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,466
Line up.
Go to the end.

104
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,968
Come on. Move along.

105
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,099
Stay in line.
Hey.

106
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,894
Perhaps I could speak
with your supervisor.

107
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,271
Sure. Whatever you say.

108
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,942
Louis Dega.

109
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,985
Guy's a millionaire.

110
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,072
Busted making counterfeit
defense bonds.

111
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,074
All right. Next.
Won't last long.

112
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,576
Every con in the prison
will want to cut him open

113
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,286
to get the money
he's carrying.

114
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,371
Next.

115
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,087
As of this moment,

116
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,507
you are the property
of the penal administration

117
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,175
of French Guiana.

118
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,303
After serving your full term
in prison,

119
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:22,266
you will remain
in South America
as workers and colonists

120
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,645
for a period equal to that
of your original sentence.

121
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:33,110
This is for the greater good
that is French expansion.

122
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,529
As for France,

123
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,032
she has disowned you.

124
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:44,538
She has rid herself
of you altogether.

125
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,333
Forget France.

126
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,212
Now dress yourself.

127
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,562
I'm going to hell.
God, please. Keep walking.

128
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,364
Mr. Dega.

129
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,660
Your appeal is
in a few weeks.

130
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,204
Be strong, Louis.
I love you.

131
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,582
I love you.

132
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,126
You'll be home
before Christmas.

133
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,837
Dega. Mr. Dega, here.
Look this way.

134
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,297
Mr. Dega.

135
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,567
Move it.
That's enough.

136
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,778
Pick your feet up.

137
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,753
Hey, Julot.
All right, pair up.

138
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,505
Hey, take the corner.

139
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,595
Looks like Dega's
making friends already.

140
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:28,141
Julot, make sure no one
takes this hammock.

141
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,728
What are you looking at?

142
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,355
Hey.

143
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,024
I saved you a spot
next to me.

144
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,194
You got a lot
of eyes on you.

145
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,030
I can keep you safe.

146
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,950
All I need's enough money
for an escape.

147
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,662
Won't be cheap,
but you'll be safe.

148
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,039
Said the scorpion
to the frog.

149
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,750
We're all scorpions
in here, pal.

150
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,211
I think I'd be better off
taking my chances

151
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,797
setting up in front of the
guards, wouldn't you agree?

152
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,010
You seem like the kind
of man who can make up
his own mind.

153
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,013
You're a good judge
of character.

154
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,267
Have a good night.

155
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,811
Yeah, you, too.

156
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,655
Hey. Me and you,
we should team up
for an escape.

157
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,369
If I get caught in some
half-assed escape,
I want it to be my mistake.

158
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,834
Settle down, now.

159
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,645
I know you hide
your money in your guts.

160
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,692
Upper deck.

161
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,027
Move it back. Back, you.

162
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,029
Back. Back now.

163
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,198
Get him out of here.

164
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,201
The animals can clean up
their own mess.

165
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,621
Come on. Get rid of him.
Show's over.

166
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,734
How'd you sleep
last night?

167
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,618
Smells like freedom.

168
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,537
What, you've
heard of someone
escaping the prison?

169
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,415
Doesn't mean
it can't be done.

170
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,543
I have trouble seeing hope
in hopelessness.

171
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,629
That's why I need
a man like you.

172
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,965
I've reconsidered
your offer.

173
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,510
You keep me alive until
I'm set up on the island,

174
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,472
I'll underwrite any escape
you care to arrange.

175
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,438
All right.

176
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,777
And when the time comes,
you're not coming with me.

177
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,114
I have no intention
of escaping.

178
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,117
Unlike you,
I enjoy being alive.

179
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,245
My wife's working
on my appeal.

180
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,413
I'm confident
I'll be home by Christmas.

181
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,001
A fellow optimist.

182
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,808
I'm in for one.

183
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:21,977
Two.

184
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,172
Look what the fuck
you did!

185
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,554
Yeah!

186
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,475
Get the knife.

187
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,895
Come on! Get the knife!

188
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,900
Get the knife!

189
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,185
I'll kill you!

190
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,937
Steam!
Turn on the steam!

191
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,877
Come on,
come on, come on.

192
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,253
Get back!

193
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,718
Strip and line up,
you fucking animals,
or it's the steam again.

194
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,845
All right, on your feet.
Strip down.

195
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,597
Give me
the fucking knife.

196
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,808
Move it. Come on.
Line up in back there.

197
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,018
Let's go. Strip down.

198
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,978
Come on. Come on.

199
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,940
On your feet.
Line up in back there.

200
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,151
Strip down. Strip right up.

201
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,613
Hands. Hands out.
Everybody, hands out.

202
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,573
Everyone, let's have
your hands out. Let's see.

203
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,283
What you got?
Get him to the infirmary.

204
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,661
All right, let's get
this piece of meat
out of here.

205
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,831
Show me your hands. Let's see.
Turn them over. You.

206
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,458
Yeah, this one's
been fighting for sure.

207
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,961
Take him to first class.
Come on.

208
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,046
Come on.

209
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,881
Time to go.

210
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,466
First class, let's go.

211
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,177
Try and behave, ladies.

212
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,082
Go!

213
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,338
You should've finished him.

214
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,134
I don't want
to kill anyone.

215
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,140
I'm going to get
myself sent
to the hospital.

216
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,476
Let me know if a guard
looks this way.

217
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,394
Do not stop!

218
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,854
Get a move along!

219
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,108
Eyes front!

220
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,863
Move it. Now! You, too.

221
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,657
Let's go! You heard me.

222
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,951
Move it! Move it!
Crazy, Julot.

223
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,786
Go that way.
You go this way.

224
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,456
You two. Come on now.
Form a line.

225
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,167
Form a line.
I said form a line.
Go ahead.

226
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,919
You two. You stay here.

227
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,378
Go back in line.

228
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,298
Move it! Come on. That way.

229
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,842
Come on, move it. Come on.
Move. Move along.

230
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,136
I said move it, God damn it.
Get up! Get up!

231
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,597
Come on, you. Move along.
Move along.

232
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,558
Eyes straight. Eyes straight.
Come on. Move.

233
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,811
That way. Over there. Come on.

234
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,688
Faster!
Move! Move it!

235
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,273
Come on now!
Come on, move.

236
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,858
Don't be looking at me
like that.

237
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,110
Come on, move!
You, too.

238
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,779
Move along.

239
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,406
All right! Get him up!

240
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,158
My fucking leg!

241
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,372
My leg.

242
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,665
My leg!

243
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:58,962
That's enough.

244
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,506
Break it up. Break it up.
Break it up. Break it up.

245
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,466
Move back. Move back.
Get in line!

246
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,593
Move. Back to the line.
Move. Move.

247
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,929
Raise your hand
if 1 call your name.

248
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,306
Augustin.

249
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,643
Barba.

250
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,019
Come on, now.
Stay in line.

251
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:17,689
Bellaire.

252
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,400
Move along.
Over there.

253
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,068
Lofton.

254
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,279
Form straight
up over there.

255
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,656
Navarrone.

256
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,826
Navarrone.

257
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,953
Move out!

258
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,039
Move out!

259
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,768
All right.
Come on. Move it.

260
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,064
Keep moving!

261
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,653
Prisoners, halt!

262
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,823
Open the gates.

263
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,868
March!

264
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,664
I know many of you
at this very moment
are thinking about escape.

265
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,916
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

266
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,127
We'll be happy to shoot you.

267
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,964
If, however,
you should avoid
that mercy,

268
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,884
there are two guardians
who are always on duty.

269
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:56,180
The bush, where the best thing
that can happen to you
is starvation.

270
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,766
Or you could choose the sea,

271
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,980
where sharks, too,
I assure you,
are always hungry.

272
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,942
If you manage to survive
your first attempt,

273
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,236
you'll get two years
in solitary.

274
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,406
Second attempt,
five years in solitary

275
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,033
followed by a life sentence
at Devils Island.

276
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,578
If you commit murder,

277
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,748
you'll be executed.

278
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,334
That's all.

279
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,811
Move, move!

280
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,787
Jesus Christ.

281
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,672
Here. Take the corner.

282
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,892
Hey. Keep your eyes open
and don't move.

283
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,313
Hey.

284
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,942
Who decides what work
we get assigned to?

285
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,906
Excuse my ill-mannered...
I thought I told you
not to move.

286
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,784
He has yet to be tamed.

287
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,162
And you're obviously
a very important,
very, very busy man.

288
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,039
I'm just a turnkey.

289
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,542
We're looking
for someone
to ensure

290
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:51,796
we're assigned
the right sort of
work in the morning.

291
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,298
It'll cost you 1,000.

292
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,342
I don't think so.

293
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,678
No. Now that seems
entirely too high.

294
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,598
Sir.

295
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:05,059
I think we started off
on the wrong foot.

296
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,896
I think 1,000
is actually fair.

297
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,065
Now, is there a selection
of work you have?

298
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,150
Attendants at
the hospital.

299
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,320
And for a thousand
you can throw
in a pouch of tobacco.

300
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,114
And a notebook.
A notebook?

301
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,241
I'm an artist.
You're a forger.

302
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,909
And you're
a safe cracker,

303
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,453
a profession of which
I thoroughly disapprove.

304
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,205
At least I'm
an honest criminal.

305
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,541
Hey, I'm gonna
need that
right now.

306
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,961
I mean, right now.
Excuse me.

307
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,801
I think you need
to go to the bathroom.

308
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,890
Yes, of course.

309
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,976
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen.

310
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,940
Where are you going?

311
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,359
I've never
been here before.

312
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,863
Toilet's there,
princess.

313
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,624
What animal but a man

314
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:12,752
keeps his only means
of survival up his ass?

315
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,295
Something bit me.

316
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,311
We got a runner!

317
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,563
Lockdown!
Lock it down.

318
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,358
Which barracks?
No, he broke
out of the hospital.

319
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,901
Just one, I think.
The hospital?

320
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,194
Lock down your barrack!

321
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,862
I bet that's Julot.

322
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,155
Lock it down!

323
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,366
Son of a bitch
didn't waste any time.

324
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,494
Lock down
the north barrack!

325
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,581
You see?

326
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,208
It can be done.

327
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,670
Lock it down.
Into the jungle.
Stand down.

328
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,215
Route zero.

329
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,262
Route zero.

330
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,265
Route zero.

331
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,272
My friend and I need
to be kept together
at all times.

332
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,524
Set these two up
in the hospital.

333
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,318
And it'll be a few
days before I'm well
enough to do any...

334
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,945
Don't push it.
...work.

335
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,116
Route zero.

336
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,495
Mr. Dega. Stop.

337
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,251
I know you.

338
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,836
Do you know me?

339
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,297
Yes. Yes,
of course.

340
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,507
You're the deputy
warden, Sir.

341
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,634
My sister's husband

342
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,387
was arrested selling
counterfeit defense bonds

343
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:30,306
you furnished him
with in Marseilles.

344
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,103
Dega is a very
common name
in Marseilles.

345
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,897
Santini.
Yes, sir.

346
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,107
This one goes straight
to route zero.

347
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,026
Take him away.

348
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,153
Wait.

349
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:45,988
Take him, too.

350
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,036
We try not to separate
old friends here.

351
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,288
Get them
to route zero.
Move.

352
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,374
What is route zero?

353
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,214
Are those men clear?

354
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,514
You're on the rail!

355
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,892
I don't feel so good.

356
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,148
It goes in the cart.

357
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,319
Move along.

358
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,779
You do a lot of talking.

359
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,489
I do.
Yeah, stop that.

360
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,200
It passes...
Passes the time.

361
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,327
Get out of my face.
Get out of my face.

362
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,745
Here, you take
the bigger rock.

363
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,668
If you get into
a fight with him,

364
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,753
I'm not protecting you.

365
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,913
If your wife was here,

366
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,125
you were in Paris
with all that money,

367
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,837
how much would you pay
to get her back?

368
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,340
Everything I have.

369
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,305
How much would she pay
for you?

370
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,691
You're a real optimist.

371
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,484
Little man.

372
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:29,944
Little man.

373
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,737
You need to put
some weight.

374
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,782
You can push harder
than that. Come on.

375
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,450
Trust me, he can't.

376
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,535
Trust me, he has to.

377
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,538
Come on, push it!

378
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,791
Clear the charge!

379
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,170
Push it!
Pick up the pace.

380
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,258
I have...
I have diarrhea.

381
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,344
What you want me
to do about it?

382
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,388
No, you don't understand.

383
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,140
I lost the money.

384
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,858
What's the holdup?

385
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:12,820
What the hell are you doing?

386
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,116
What?
Stop shitting around.

387
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,118
He'll get us all killed.
You mind your own cart.

388
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,287
That little guy is
making more
work for the rest of us.

389
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,413
Mind your own business.

390
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,665
Break it up.
Break it up.

391
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,043
What are you doing?

392
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,587
Get up. Get up!

393
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,214
Get up!

394
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,885
On your feet.
I can't.

395
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:37,970
Pick him up.

396
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,264
Come on, pick him up.
Put him in the cart.

397
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,645
Back to work.

398
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,231
Move your cart.

399
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,829
You had one job to do.

400
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,748
You couldn't do it.

401
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,750
My body's in revolt.

402
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,626
Where is it now?

403
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,962
Where do you think?

404
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,135
I should've known better
than to trust a thief.

405
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,641
I can't steal
what's already mine.

406
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,856
As soon as we get back
to the barracks,
you're taking it back.

407
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,525
And you're gonna
hold onto it
this time.

408
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:36,362
I don't care if you
have to sew your ass
up to do it.

409
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,124
I'm sorry.

410
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:57,216
I may have prematurely judged
you with an unworthy
degree of suspicion.

411
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,885
Well, don't propose yet.

412
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,137
I just don't like carrying
things in my ass.

413
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,538
He's dead.

414
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,207
He's dead!
Shut up, birdie.

415
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,459
Are you stupid or what?

416
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,255
We share his ration.

417
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,589
Here.

418
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,596
Here.

419
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,642
You got yourself
a boyfriend, huh?

420
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,946
You were in the navy?

421
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,075
What do you think?

422
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,203
I thought maybe it meant
"jailbird."

423
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,414
The swallows.

424
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:12,708
Stands for hope.

425
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,835
First thing you see
when you reach land.

426
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:18,130
I know.
Yeah? How come?

427
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,549
You were in the navy?

428
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,301
Eighteen months.

429
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,845
Followed by six
in the brig.

430
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,221
Didn't suit me.

431
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,641
A butterfly.

432
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,602
So, you're a thief now.

433
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,730
Guess that didn't
suit you either.

434
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,408
We should
go sailing sometime.

435
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,456
You got a boat?

436
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,543
Can you get any of that?

437
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:58,712
Maybe.

438
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,799
Well, let me know then.

439
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,723
Your boyfriend's
got trouble.

440
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,643
Give me your money
or you and your friend
will die.

441
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,021
Is there trouble?

442
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,564
I was talking
to your bitch.

443
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,149
And now you're
talking to me.

444
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,526
Bitch...

445
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,612
Work it out
in the barracks!

446
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,614
Break is over!

447
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,741
Get in line!

448
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,162
Break's over! Form up!

449
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,166
Line it up!

450
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,876
Line it up!

451
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,048
Stop. Stop!

452
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,927
Turn around.
Eyes up front. Come on.

453
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:53,850
You know better than to truck
your ladies through here
after a rain storm.

454
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,687
Yeah. Can you help me out?

455
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,564
I'll make it good for you.

456
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,399
Get the girls up here.

457
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,192
Come on.

458
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,661
Hey.

459
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,499
Can you hear me?

460
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,421
How much to take me
up the coast?

461
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,381
Don't be stupid.

462
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,925
I'll give you 2,000.

463
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:33,682
Guard!
Don't turn me in,
for Christ's sake.

464
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,850
4,000.

465
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,103
What's the problem?

466
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:43,317
Just wanted to know
which girl I should send
to repay you.

467
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,485
One that hasn't
caught anything yet.

468
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,908
My boat is on
the other side
of the river.

469
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,370
I'll be there
for three more days.

470
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,289
It's 5,000.

471
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,833
You're a goddamn thief.

472
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,282
The guards are coming.

473
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,992
Don't fucking touch me!

474
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,163
I didn't know
it would be like this.

475
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:46,583
I'll be dead long
before my appeal.

476
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,380
I need to go with you.

477
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:01,848
That wasn't part
of the deal.

478
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:05,769
Yes, I realize that,
but I still have
to go with you.

479
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:14,236
You ever sail a boat?

480
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,032
Spent any time at sea?

481
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,955
Yes, I've spent
a number of days at sea.

482
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:28,333
I was locked in a cage
for most of them.

483
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,504
But I think I understand
the concept well enough.

484
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,465
You can't come
with me, Dega.

485
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,805
You should call me Louis.

486
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,652
Keep it moving!

487
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,447
Get them in line.

488
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,451
Stand straight!

489
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,336
Down on your knees.

490
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:18,258
Take off your hats
and cross your arms.

491
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,054
At the moment of execution,

492
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,099
you're all to bow your heads.

493
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,745
A man stabbed two guards,

494
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,165
one of whom died
this morning,

495
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,377
leaving two children without
their father.

496
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:56,630
And for what?

497
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,591
So he could go on a run
through the jungle.

498
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,343
Thank you for coming.

499
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,181
Watch me go to hell!

500
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:51,726
Prisoner ready.

501
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,034
Keeping you is no benefit.

502
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,787
Destroying you is no loss.

503
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:17,252
You.

504
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:18,753
Pick another inmate.

505
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:20,755
You carry the body.

506
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,400
Go get the boat ready.

507
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:53,848
He's gone.

508
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:58,520
It's just flesh and blood.

509
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,282
Why are you stopping?

510
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,369
What are you doing?

511
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:15,745
Move.

512
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,959
I said, what the hell
are you doing?

513
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,420
Get up.

514
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,468
Get up, you little worm.

515
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,808
Get your ass up!

516
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:49,320
You little worm.

517
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:55,743
Oh, shit.

518
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,662
Oh, shit.

519
00:49:58,830 --> 00:49:59,831
Stop.

520
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,124
Hey, stop!

521
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:12,135
Hey!

522
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,846
We've got a runner!

523
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,682
He's heading north.

524
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:20,476
Papi. Papi?

525
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,061
Heading north now!

526
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,522
Papillon!

527
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,486
Check the tree line!

528
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,680
Hey!

529
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,408
Take that north side!

530
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,219
Pick him up.

531
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,013
Come on.

532
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,348
Come on.

533
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,038
You're a good man.

534
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,461
Yeah, I'm a good man
that wants good money.

535
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:14,340
Look, I don't have it.

536
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:16,217
Not with me.

537
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,761
But I'm going to make it
worth your while.

538
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,513
I got a lot of money
in Paris.

539
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,974
I'll give you
everything I got.

540
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,913
Even if you had the money,

541
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,875
the warden will pay us double.

542
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,002
Son of a bitch.

543
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,540
You're lucky
that guard didn't die,

544
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,585
otherwise, you would
have met
the guillotine.

545
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:36,297
Now you'll be
transferred to the island
of Saint-Joseph,

546
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,551
where you'll serve
a two-year sentence
in solitary confinement.

547
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,429
It's not
rehabilitation.

548
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:45,932
We know
that's useless.

549
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:48,476
So, we do our best
to break you.

550
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,525
Strange things
happen there.

551
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,445
Especially to those
who cling to hope.

552
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:02,281
Because there is no hope
on Saint-Joseph.

553
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,492
Just silence.

554
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:21,551
You heard the warden.

555
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,971
Silence must be observed
at all times.

556
00:54:27,971 --> 00:54:57,971
<b>YAWNTiC Encode | www.movieddl.me</b>

557
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,697
Thought you grew wings,
didn't you?

558
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,494
Grab him.

559
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,749
I'll teach you
to be quiet.

560
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:50,092
You make another peep,

561
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,012
you might not survive
your time here.

562
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:31,050
Come on. He's crazy.
Come on. Come on.

563
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,971
Enjoy your next
two years here.

564
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,360
Dega.

565
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,518
Hold on.
Need to check that.

566
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,233
What is that?

567
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,362
Somebody paying you
to bring this shit in,
you son of a bitch?

568
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:21,864
Who's paying you?

569
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:24,074
Who's paying you,
you son of a bitch?

570
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,085
Jesus.
I think you killed him.

571
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,340
Get that body out of here
and clean up the mess.

572
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,551
What the hell
were you thinking?

573
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,532
No wonder you
haven't broken yet.

574
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,454
How long has it
been going on?

575
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,208
You may speak.

576
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:20,673
Who sent you
those coconuts?

577
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,436
If you don't fess up,

578
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:37,856
I'll put you
on half rations.

579
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,989
You're choosing
another man's life
over your own.

580
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:03,340
Put him on half rations.

581
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,219
I brought you
some soup.

582
01:06:15,556 --> 01:06:17,307
It's got meat in it.

583
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,082
Just tell me his name.

584
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,676
Tell me his name.

585
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:24,208
Do you think a person knows
when he's going mad?

586
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,545
Or do you think
it's blissful ignorance?

587
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,506
'Cause you're
about to find out.

588
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:47,773
Put him in darkness
for the remainder
of his sentence.

589
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:49,650
Or the remainder
of his life.

590
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,652
Whichever comes first.

591
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,641
Six.

592
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,327
This is a good escape.

593
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:36,311
Is he still alive?

594
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:41,149
The years are up.

595
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:28,405
I know that some
of you at this very moment
are thinking about escape.

596
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:31,783
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

597
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,160
We'll be happy
to shoot you.

598
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:38,039
However, should
you avoid that mercy,

599
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:41,334
there are two guardians
who are always on duty.

600
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,922
The bush, where
the best thing that can
happen to you is starvation.

601
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,008
Or you could
choose the sea,

602
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,678
where sharks, too,
are always hungry.

603
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,726
If you
manage to survive
your first attempt,

604
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:01,104
you'll get two years
in solitary.

605
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,982
Second attempt,
five years in solitary

606
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,860
followed by
a life sentence
at Devils Island.

607
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,113
If you commit murder,

608
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,242
you'll be executed.

609
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:18,079
That's all.

610
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:25,420
Papi.

611
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:48,276
I wanted
to come sooner,

612
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,780
but I was afraid
you wouldn't wanna see me.

613
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,329
I'm sorry.

614
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,707
It's my fault
you're here.

615
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:13,551
As you predicted,
my appeal's
run into some problems.

616
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:17,472
But my wife's
doing very well.

617
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:20,517
She recently
married my lawyer.

618
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,609
Well, to hell
with her then.

619
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,865
You son of a bitch.

620
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,576
I thought you'd gone
simple on me.

621
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,666
That's the idea.

622
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,135
You know, you'd have had
a much easier time

623
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,429
if you'd just given
them my name.

624
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,473
It's not like I didn't
think about it.

625
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:05,061
I just know how
goddamn delicate you are.

626
01:16:05,145 --> 01:16:06,229
Hmm.

627
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:14,738
I fear under
similar circumstances,
I would've fared differently.

628
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:18,199
I don't know
how you made it.

629
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,911
I just got used
to the silence.

630
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,749
If I ever get out,

631
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,378
I'm gonna live
a different kind of life.

632
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:39,012
This Sunday, the warden
will be showing a film
in the courtyard

633
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,347
entertaining some
local politicians.

634
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:42,640
It'll be loud.

635
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:45,935
The guards
will be doing double
duty, spread very thin.

636
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:49,022
This is your best chance.

637
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:52,984
Can you get a boat?

638
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,235
No.

639
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:57,280
What about Celier?

640
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:59,949
Is he still here?
Unfortunately, yes.

641
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:03,745
If he can
still get a boat,

642
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:07,665
do you have enough
money to pay for it?

643
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:11,002
I might, but then
he'd wanna come with us.

644
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:13,713
"Us"?

645
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:16,674
Us.

646
01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:21,846
All right.

647
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,099
But we still need a boat.

648
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:28,561
You leave now.

649
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,021
Leave!

650
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:31,439
Get out!

651
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,649
Get out!

652
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,942
Leave!

653
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,319
Get out!

654
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,947
This man's mad!
Go!

655
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,907
Get out!
He's out of his mind.

656
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,909
No! No, no, no!

657
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:43,993
No!

658
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:46,329
No! Help me!
He's out of his mind.

659
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:47,622
Help me!

660
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:48,706
Help!
Here.

661
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,416
Come on, come on.
Calm down, calm down.

662
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,168
Let him go, let him go.

663
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:54,838
It's okay, it's okay.

664
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,132
Bring me some pills.

665
01:17:58,216 --> 01:18:00,844
Come on. Take one.
Bring me some water.

666
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:03,930
Swallow.

667
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:09,477
You'll be okay.

668
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:25,243
Lights out, 10 minutes.

669
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,652
Stop. Relax.

670
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:01,571
Relax.
Get off!

671
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,406
I will never
let you fuck me.

672
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:04,657
Shh.

673
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:09,537
You will soon,
if you know
what's good for you.

674
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:29,724
Hey. Hey,
I just want to talk.

675
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,895
I'm not a goddamn whore.

676
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,396
That's not what I want.

677
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,607
Yeah, everybody
says that until they do.

678
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,776
Trust me, I don't.

679
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,111
I got a different
proposition.

680
01:19:43,363 --> 01:19:46,532
If you repeat one word
of this, it's not going
to be good for you.

681
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:49,327
I don't want
to know, then.
Maybe you do.

682
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,414
Look, I'm putting
something together.

683
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:55,667
This Sunday.

684
01:19:56,918 --> 01:19:58,836
We got room
for one more.

685
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,507
I have nothing
to offer you.

686
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:05,843
I need you to
distract that turnkey.

687
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:10,807
Get him to come in here
at a certain time,
keep him occupied.

688
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:15,228
If I do that,
your plan better work.

689
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:19,440
It'll work.
It's not going
to be easy.

690
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:22,151
Can you handle yourself?

691
01:20:24,404 --> 01:20:26,489
You were framed
for murder, right?

692
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,536
Well, nobody framed me.

693
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,210
That's Celier.

694
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,088
He's gotten us a boat.

695
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:44,465
Let's see
the arm. Infected.

696
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:49,804
Good job.

697
01:20:51,556 --> 01:20:52,640
Papi!

698
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:55,184
You skinny son of a bitch.

699
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:57,353
Good to see you.

700
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,480
What'd you do
to your arm?

701
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:01,566
I had to cut myself
to get in here.

702
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:03,359
It still work?
Yeah, it's nothing.

703
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:04,944
Don't think about it.
I can still kick your ass.

704
01:21:05,028 --> 01:21:06,446
Can we hurry this up?

705
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:07,739
I have to get back.

706
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:09,574
Birdie, can you
shut up for once?

707
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:12,744
This is Maturette.
He's our fourth.

708
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:14,454
Oh, yeah?

709
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:16,831
You know how
to handle yourself?

710
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:18,958
Yeah, with a knife.
All right, take it easy.

711
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,918
Oh, feisty little
one, huh?

712
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:24,797
You all set?
Yeah, I'm set.

713
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,342
I got a guy
that's hiding a boat
on the bank.

714
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,344
It's upriver a ways.

715
01:21:30,762 --> 01:21:33,848
From there,
it's a straight shot
to the ocean.

716
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,393
But we need
half the money now.

717
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,314
What about you?

718
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,025
When the film starts,
we'll go through
the warden's building.

719
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,151
I'll have a key.

720
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:48,404
We got a plan.

721
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,698
We got a plan.

722
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:00,374
You all right?

723
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,418
No.

724
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:05,213
I'm not sure
we can trust him.

725
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,633
Look at him.
He's unpredictable.

726
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,301
He's like
a caged animal.

727
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,970
We're all animals
in here, pal.

728
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:16,849
He'll be fine.

729
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:19,602
He needs the money now.

730
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:33,616
Here.

731
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,160
It's the sedatives
they gave me.

732
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,412
Get them
in the guards' coffee.

733
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,456
We'll do the rest.

734
01:22:42,834 --> 01:22:44,043
I have to get back.

735
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,295
Hey.

736
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:50,341
You're doing good.

737
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:07,191
Hey.
What do we
have here, huh?

738
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,068
Go to hell.

739
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:11,112
Give me those back.

740
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:13,447
He's going to
fuck up our plan.

741
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:15,074
He's going to be fine.

742
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,619
What the...
What are you doing, man?

743
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,254
All right!
That's enough.

744
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,381
Break it up. Break it up.

745
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,801
He does the
warden's books.

746
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:41,642
Huh...

747
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,689
I'd have figured I'd know
how to throw a punch

748
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,984
considering
how often my father
used to beat me.

749
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,573
Yours, too?

750
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:59,368
My parents
are schoolteachers.

751
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:04,790
See you tonight.

752
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,179
Anisette for the warden.

753
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:20,389
The best you have.

754
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:24,560
Just give me the bottle.

755
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,888
There's two or three.

756
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:46,434
Would you gentlemen
like your coffees freshened?

757
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:47,810
Yeah, bring it on in.

758
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:06,370
Compliments
of the warden.

759
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,498
Very nice.

760
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:16,922
Here.

761
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:25,139
If we kill someone
and this goes wrong,
it's the guillotine.

762
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:27,641
No one dies.

763
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:55,169
Give me another
one of them.
All right.

764
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:14,355
Dega, where
are you going?

765
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:18,359
Dega. The warden. Now.

766
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,272
Stop!

767
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:57,648
What was that?

768
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:00,734
I'd better go check.

769
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:25,426
It's working.

770
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:51,619
Oh, man.
We're too early.

771
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:55,247
Louis, do you
have a light?

772
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,458
Yes, of course, sir.

773
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:09,512
No.

774
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:11,889
Okay, go inside.
Everybody, go inside.

775
01:29:12,223 --> 01:29:14,433
Come on.
Come on, darling.
Fuck.

776
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:17,811
That's our way out.
No, no.

777
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,154
What's he doing?

778
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:34,662
Power's out.
Oh, fuck.

779
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:41,085
Papi, we got to move.
We can't stay here.

780
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:43,504
We wait for Dega.

781
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:45,172
Forget about Degal

782
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,300
He's not reliable,
and you know it.

783
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:50,636
Let's just go. Come on.

784
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:52,888
You want to go?

785
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:54,515
Go.

786
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:57,935
Are you with me?

787
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:00,563
Hell, yeah.
Open the gate.

788
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,065
What's wrong with you?

789
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:12,616
I stole the keys
to get us up
to the central walkway.

790
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:14,952
We can take that
to the guard tower.

791
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:18,831
As long as
the lights stay off,
they won't see us.

792
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:22,209
And then we jump?
You got a better idea?

793
01:30:30,718 --> 01:30:32,636
Come on. Come on.

794
01:30:38,142 --> 01:30:39,310
Go, go!

795
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:45,399
I've got the wall.

796
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:49,653
You! With me
to the south wall.
Yes, sir!

797
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:53,907
Yes, we're on lockdown.

798
01:30:55,034 --> 01:30:56,452
Section secured!

799
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:09,923
Oh, shit.

800
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:11,634
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

801
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,678
Easy.

802
01:31:14,762 --> 01:31:15,804
Lock it down!

803
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,187
Are you all right?
Yeah.

804
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,397
oe Let's go. Come on!

805
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:26,565
Go, go, go.

806
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:30,110
Go.

807
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,169
Come on.

808
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:49,254
Jump!

809
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:51,173
Come on.

810
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:56,637
Come on.

811
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,223
Come on!
They're going to see
you! Come on.

812
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:03,602
Come on.

813
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,313
Jump!
Come on. Jump!

814
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:11,068
Shit.

815
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:12,986
Hey, it's broken.
Leave him.

816
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,488
He's got the money.

817
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:17,574
Maturette, help me.

818
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:19,660
Christ.

819
01:32:20,494 --> 01:32:21,745
All right, come on.

820
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:24,373
Let's go.

821
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:36,218
Come on. Come on.

822
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:39,054
Come on.

823
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:42,224
How much further
to the boat?

824
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:45,060
You're slowing
us down, Dega.
Come on.

825
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:46,645
We've got to move faster.

826
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:16,425
Don't take another step.

827
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:20,095
You're not taking me back.

828
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:24,141
That depends.
Do you have my money?

829
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:29,980
Hey.

830
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:34,610
Papi, it's okay.
This is my guy
with the boat.

831
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:41,950
Where's our boat?

832
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:43,744
It's a ways up the river.

833
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:46,747
You want me
to take you there?
Pay me.

834
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:48,457
Or fuck you.

835
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:04,890
This is all I have left.

836
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:11,980
Let's
keep that between us.

837
01:34:33,961 --> 01:34:35,420
Enjoy your freedom.

838
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:21,925
Fucking jerk.

839
01:35:22,968 --> 01:35:23,969
Fuck!

840
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,138
What kind of shit boat
did you get us?

841
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,556
Shut up, Degal

842
01:35:28,098 --> 01:35:29,308
You're lucky to be here.

843
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:30,392
Keep bailing.

844
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,395
Get it out of the boat.
I'm trying.

845
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:36,732
Don't throw it at me,
Dega. God damn it.

846
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:38,609
Throw it in the water.
I'm throwing it
at the water!

847
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:40,277
Maturette!
Yes?

848
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,361
Check the tiller.

849
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:44,489
I got it, I got it.

850
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:53,457
Papi, this boat can't hold
all of us. You know it.

851
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,000
We need to lighten
the weight.

852
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,759
He's going to die
anyway, Papi.

853
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,136
Nobody needs to die.

854
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,472
Fuck! It fell off!

855
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,850
Fix the tiller.
Fix the tiller!
It's broken.

856
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:13,602
Move.

857
01:36:58,021 --> 01:37:00,315
Here, take this.
Take this.

858
01:37:00,983 --> 01:37:02,067
Maturette, help me.

859
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:19,584
This storm is gonna
sink the boat.

860
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:21,586
We need to act,
and we need to act now.

861
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:23,171
Just let me get
the boat ready.

862
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:26,675
Did you lose your
mind? Huh?

863
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:28,969
You want to die
because of this guy?

864
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:31,346
Nobody needs to die.

865
01:37:36,435 --> 01:37:37,894
Well, we can't all live.

866
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:40,439
Dega, he's dead weight.

867
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:43,358
How much money you have?

868
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:47,154
He doesn't have any money.

869
01:37:48,155 --> 01:37:49,448
He doesn't have any money?

870
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:51,533
You hear that, Maturette?

871
01:37:52,284 --> 01:37:53,452
They've been lying to us.

872
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:56,038
You want to die for him?

873
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:01,668
That makes it
two against one,
Papi. Step aside.

874
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,503
No need to do anything.

875
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:05,714
Step aside, Papi!

876
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:07,883
I'm not going to
die for that guy.

877
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:11,470
Last chance, Papi.
Step aside!

878
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,807
I don't know about you.
I'm going home!

879
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:43,960
Shit.

880
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:05,357
Dega.

881
01:39:10,862 --> 01:39:12,447
Stop! Stop!

882
01:39:13,657 --> 01:39:15,659
Enough.
That's enough.

883
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:19,287
That's enough.

884
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:21,873
Enough.

885
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:44,724
Welcome.

886
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:52,691
I was traveling
with two other men.

887
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:54,484
They're being cared for.

888
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:00,699
Where are we?

889
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:03,118
This is Colombia.

890
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:08,290
We know where
you've come from.

891
01:42:11,543 --> 01:42:13,378
But you need
only repent.

892
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:18,550
Allow God back
into your life,

893
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,553
and you'll be forgiven.

894
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:26,182
You should go
and wash yourself.

895
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,311
Then come
and pray with us.

896
01:43:52,394 --> 01:43:54,479
We need to keep moving.

897
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:01,986
They know where
we came from.

898
01:44:04,531 --> 01:44:06,282
Our deal is done.

899
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,370
I told you we
couldn't trust him.

900
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:16,501
I'm leaving.

901
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:21,214
With or without you.

902
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:41,484
Good luck.

903
01:44:53,538 --> 01:44:54,914
Papi, we made it!

904
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:58,418
Papi, it's
paradise here.

905
01:44:59,085 --> 01:45:00,837
Yeah, but it's not home.

906
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:04,215
Not for me, anyway.

907
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,094
Good luck, Maturette.

908
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:21,668
We're leaving.

909
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,003
Now!

910
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:26,381
Come on.

911
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,300
Papi!

912
01:46:29,384 --> 01:46:30,552
Maturette!

913
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:42,313
Repent!

914
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:44,607
If you are truly sorry
for what you have done,

915
01:46:44,691 --> 01:46:46,276
then you have
nothing to fear!

916
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:48,528
God will watch
over you.

917
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:58,288
You came back.

918
01:47:32,739 --> 01:47:33,781
Come on, Papi.

919
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:02,477
I had to come
and see this for myself.

920
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:06,564
Few men survive
five years in solitary.

921
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:16,157
What were you living for?

922
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:21,871
'Cause I don't think
you're going to find it
where you're going.

923
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:26,501
Devils Island.

924
01:49:14,507 --> 01:49:16,342
Let me out!

925
01:50:33,294 --> 01:50:37,715
Now, what's the son
of two schoolteachers
doing in a place like this?

926
01:51:16,504 --> 01:51:17,505
Well,

927
01:51:19,465 --> 01:51:20,675
what do you think?

928
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:26,556
I've had five years
to work on it.

929
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:31,269
The warden wasn't very happy
with my disobedience,

930
01:51:31,853 --> 01:51:34,939
so he sent me straight
here to Devils Island.

931
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:53,040
Let's get some
food in you.

932
01:52:10,016 --> 01:52:11,434
Rise and shine.

933
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:15,313
Come on.

934
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:17,773
There's work to be done.

935
01:52:47,178 --> 01:52:49,889
Let me out!

936
01:53:30,137 --> 01:53:31,931
Can we get to the ocean?

937
01:53:41,983 --> 01:53:43,567
I know what
you're thinking.

938
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:48,155
But even if you
survive the fall,

939
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:51,575
you'll never
survive the ocean.

940
01:55:07,568 --> 01:55:10,362
It's all about the waves.
What?

941
01:55:11,572 --> 01:55:13,157
What are you
talking about?

942
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,034
What do you think
I'm talking about?

943
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:19,038
Oh, go back to bed.
That's suicide,
not escape.

944
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:20,164
No, listen.

945
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:24,418
All we need to do
is build a raft
and get it to the ocean.

946
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:27,755
The tide will take us
straight to the mainland.

947
01:55:30,549 --> 01:55:31,759
Just come and see.

948
01:55:32,927 --> 01:55:33,928
Come and see.

949
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:56,992
See? We ride
the current to freedom.

950
01:58:13,212 --> 01:58:16,840
I'm a little concerned
about your ability
to protect me right now.

951
01:58:17,174 --> 01:58:20,302
Don't worry.
The fall will
probably kill us.

952
01:58:23,597 --> 01:58:25,099
Let's tie
these together.

953
01:58:37,653 --> 01:58:39,071
I need to stay.

954
01:58:47,162 --> 01:58:48,831
What are you
talking about?

955
01:58:53,544 --> 01:58:55,004
I need to stay.

956
01:58:57,089 --> 01:58:59,049
For the same reason
you have to go.

957
01:59:01,969 --> 01:59:03,470
I belong here.

958
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,811
It's okay.

959
01:59:14,315 --> 01:59:15,482
It's good.

960
01:59:49,266 --> 01:59:52,186
Come on, now,
you don't want to
waste any more time.

961
02:01:44,798 --> 02:01:46,133
Louis!

962
02:01:49,094 --> 02:01:50,262
Louis!

963
02:01:53,515 --> 02:01:54,975
Louis!

964
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:01,064
I made it, you
dirty little forger!

965
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:10,008
This is for you.
Thank you.

966
02:03:15,389 --> 02:03:17,474
Sir? Your water.

967
02:03:19,268 --> 02:03:20,852
Thank you.
You're welcome.

968
02:03:27,526 --> 02:03:29,528
I'm surprised
you risked coming back.

969
02:03:30,237 --> 02:03:33,073
I'd read the statute
of limitations.

970
02:03:33,156 --> 02:03:34,866
You're still a wanted man.

971
02:03:35,784 --> 02:03:37,536
I won't be here long.

972
02:03:39,538 --> 02:03:41,540
My home is Venezuela now.

973
02:03:43,125 --> 02:03:45,627
But it's important

974
02:03:46,587 --> 02:03:48,672
that my memoir
be published here,

975
02:03:50,173 --> 02:03:51,758
in France.

976
02:04:17,909 --> 02:04:20,662
My wife convinced me
to write it all down

977
02:04:22,664 --> 02:04:25,042
while I'm still young
enough to remember.

978
02:04:29,713 --> 02:04:31,798
So, is this
really your story?

979
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:42,100
It's the story
of a lot of men.

1
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:51,693
<i>- before the end
of the season last year...</i>

2
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:55,655
<i>...and then re-injured it
in spring training...</i>

3
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,324
<i>...on a terrific game-saving play.</i>

4
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,535
<i>You know, I was talking with...</i>

5
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:04,580
- What time is this going on?
- 7:30 is the pre-game.

6
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:07,792
- Who'd you say was pitching tonight?
- Tiant's pitching.

7
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,005
- Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.
- I'd hate to be facing him.

8
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:15,216
- Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?
- Yankees.

9
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:19,554
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming
at you. You don't have time to think.

10
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:22,557
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

11
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,892
He's been hot lately.

12
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:30,273
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

13
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,371
Save.

14
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,789
The sewer.

15
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,299
Hold on, I'll get it.

16
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:01,095
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

17
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:04,932
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

18
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:12,356
Hey...

19
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,777
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

20
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:18,571
- What?
- Driving a car.

21
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,823
You know, just around the block.

22
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,784
Yeah?

23
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,454
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

24
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:30,374
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

25
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,419
Just around the block. Who said steal?

26
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,810
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

27
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,540
See, now it'll be there forever.

28
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,168
Me too.

29
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,381
Forever.

30
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:24,011
Let me ask you something.

31
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,644
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,771
Huh?

33
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,233
Come here.

34
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:41,028
Get over here.

35
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,543
Well, do you?

36
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,879
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

37
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:01,507
- No.
- No, what?

38
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,678
Sir.

39
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,556
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

40
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,436
A pack of punks, huh?

41
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,733
You live around here?

42
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,068
Right there.

43
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,949
You?

44
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,118
Right over there.

45
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,247
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

46
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,627
- Rester Street.
- Is your mother home?

47
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:50,431
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

48
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:00,107
Get in.

49
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,612
Get the fuck inside.

50
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,338
In.

51
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:30,096
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

52
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,647
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

53
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,344
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

54
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,471
The cop. He had a gold badge.

55
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,683
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

56
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,185
- No, no writing.
- He had a uniform on?

57
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,020
Like a regular police uniform?

58
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,356
- He was a cop.
- He took Davey.

59
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:26,527
- So, what were you guys doing?
- We wrote our names in the cement, but...

60
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:30,239
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

61
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:33,993
- That doesn't make sense. Come on.
- Is there something wrong, Dad?

62
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:55,222
Please.

63
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,308
No more.

64
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,227
Please.

65
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,731
No more, please.

66
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:35,429
- Have you seen him?
- Looks like damaged goods to me.

67
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,514
Jesus.

68
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,135
You took some good swings today.

69
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:17,721
Dad, I struck out.

70
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:21,517
Good swings, though.
That's what counts.

71
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:25,187
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

72
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:29,983
You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

73
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:34,780
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

74
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,616
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

75
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:44,832
- Hey, see that gutter drain over there?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:49,128
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

77
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:52,631
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

78
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,260
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

79
00:08:56,426 --> 00:08:59,388
If we could get that manhole cover up...

80
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,515
...could be 1000 balls down there.

81
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:04,852
Really? Let's try.

82
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,299
Get in.

83
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:38,302
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

84
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:43,557
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

85
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:59,114
Jimmy. Jimmy.

86
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,617
Earth to Mr. Markum.

87
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:05,370
- What do you want now, Pete?
- Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

88
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:08,415
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

89
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:10,459
- So?
- So that means less profit...

90
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,754
...and more profit means I get a raise.

91
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,464
So why don't you order more.

92
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:18,925
All right, but if the
Surgeon General calls, you're my alibi.

93
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:35,859
- Hey, you.
- Hey, there.

94
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:39,112
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

95
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,241
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

96
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,787
- Christ, I sound like...
- Someone's father?

97
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:49,289
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

98
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,795
- Later, Daddy.
- Later.

99
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:56,672
Have fun.

100
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:04,638
- Later.
- Later.

101
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,791
Brendan.

102
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:38,004
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

103
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:42,843
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

104
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,180
What will he do if he sees this?

105
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,892
Shoot you and then kill you.

106
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:57,732
It's been six hours.

107
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,360
I had to see you.

108
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:05,157
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

109
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,244
Tomorrow?

110
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,538
Like we planned?

111
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,166
Tomorrow.

112
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:20,422
Drop me around the corner.

113
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:54,748
- Take it easy.
- He kept cutting me off!

114
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:59,169
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

115
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:03,423
He followed me all the way from goddamn
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

116
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,550
That son of a bitch!

117
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:08,428
Can you believe this guy
keeps confessing?

118
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:12,766
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab a
lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

119
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,603
Hey, Devine?

120
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:24,402
- What you looking at?
- The old neighborhood.

121
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:33,119
- We're done, Sean, but I can stick around.
- No, I think we're good, thanks.

122
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:36,414
A few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

123
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,544
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

124
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:43,922
Yeah.

125
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,802
- So the wife left you six months ago?
- So?

126
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:52,263
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs...

127
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,392
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

128
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:56,976
So, what's your point?

129
00:13:57,143 --> 00:14:00,855
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

130
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,525
She wants to worship
at the temple of Devine.

131
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:06,820
- I'm married, Whitey.
- So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

132
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:09,572
You haven't talked to Lauren
in six months.

133
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:11,199
She calls all the time.

134
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:14,494
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

135
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:18,540
One of these days, the phone's gonna ring
and she'll tell me why she left.

136
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:22,001
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

137
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:44,065
Come on, come on, come on.

138
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,695
<i>The pitch. A swing and a line drive
into right field. A base hit.</i>

139
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:52,031
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

140
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:02,959
Could we please have three beers?

141
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:11,843
Yeah, come on.

142
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:27,817
You believe those chicks?

143
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:33,323
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

144
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:39,120
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

145
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:42,832
- We've got you right over here, boys.
- Yeah.

146
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,792
Yeah.

147
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:48,755
I've known her since she was a kid.

148
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:01,100
<i>A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.</i>

149
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,653
Dave.

150
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:14,739
It's 3 in the morning.

151
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,157
Where have you been?

152
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,954
Oh, my God.

153
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:23,665
I fucked up.

154
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,792
What happened?

155
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:30,797
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

156
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:34,759
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

157
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:38,304
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

158
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:42,308
- It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
- Oh, my God, Dave.

159
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:45,770
Come on. Come here.

160
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:52,068
So I'm walking to my car, and this guy
comes up to me and asks for a light.

161
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,446
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

162
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:59,200
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

163
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,828
- Oh, God.
- That's when I see the knife.

164
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:05,123
Says, "Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them."

165
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:06,833
- That's what he said?
- Yeah.

166
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:10,336
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

167
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:15,299
- You said you swung on him first.
- Jesus, can I tell the fucking story?

168
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:18,219
I'm sorry, babe.

169
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:24,600
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I...

170
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,688
I went off.

171
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:32,358
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

172
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:36,028
There was blood everywhere.

173
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:40,491
I might have killed him.

174
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:44,370
Killed him?

175
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,714
It makes you feel...

176
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:57,258
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

177
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:02,180
Yeah, but you had to, right?

178
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:05,224
It makes you feel...

179
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:07,894
...alien.

180
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:17,361
Okay.

181
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,364
Babe, you hop in the shower.

182
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:24,118
And I'll take care of your clothes.

183
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:28,456
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

184
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:30,458
Here.

185
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,765
<i>911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

186
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:49,435
<i>There's, like, this car with blood in it,
and the door's open.</i>

187
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:52,355
<i>- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.</i>

188
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:56,442
<i>It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.</i>

189
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:59,278
<i>- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.</i>

190
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,988
<i>Your name, what's your name?</i>

191
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:03,783
<i>We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.</i>

192
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,214
<i>Dispatch, this is Unit 33.</i>

193
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:23,469
<i>We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,
and you might want to notify Homicide.</i>

194
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:27,515
<i>Thirty-three, have you
found a body yet? Over.</i>

195
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:31,644
<i>No, but by the looks of this car,
we'll find one sooner or later.</i>

196
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,243
- Yeah?
- I'm in the weeds here at the store...

197
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,786
...and I need some help.

198
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:52,707
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

199
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:56,544
- That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
- Hold on.

200
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,596
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

201
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:11,517
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

202
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,353
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

203
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,896
She'll be there.

204
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:18,691
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

205
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:22,069
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

206
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:24,405
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

207
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:28,534
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

208
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:30,703
What the fuck's going on here?

209
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:43,215
- Pete, anybody show?
- No.

210
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:45,384
Katie didn't call?

211
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:47,303
No.

212
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,940
<i>- Hello?
- Drew, Jimmy.</i>

213
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:02,234
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

214
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:06,363
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

215
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:11,577
Have a nice day.

216
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:14,830
<i>No, it was Diane Cestra
who slept over. No Katie.</i>

217
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:19,043
<i>Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.</i>

218
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,920
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

219
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:24,924
<i>- She seeing anybody maybe?
- 19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?</i>

220
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,302
<i>- That's the cold truth, bud.
- I'll talk to you later.</i>

221
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:38,437
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

222
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:42,441
- Mind if I go grab a smoke?
- You can smoke the whole pack.

223
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,122
Can I help you, Brendan?

224
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:01,543
No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

225
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,005
- That's Barry's. Next aisle.
- Thanks.

226
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:21,522
- When's Sal getting here?
- Anytime now.

227
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,650
<i>- That it, Bren?
- A Globe.</i>

228
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:28,779
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

229
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,991
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

230
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:35,077
No, I just see her here sometimes.

231
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:38,038
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

232
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,959
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

233
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:56,557
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

234
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,184
Shoot.

235
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:01,520
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

236
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:06,025
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

237
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:09,361
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

238
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:13,615
He's nice. Does sign language with his
brother even though he doesn't have to.

239
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:15,701
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

240
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:19,038
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

241
00:23:19,204 --> 00:23:21,874
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

242
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,252
- No. Really?
- Straight up.

243
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:31,967
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

244
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:48,734
- Hey, there, bad boy.
- Sarge.

245
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:53,655
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

246
00:23:53,822 --> 00:23:56,200
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

247
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:01,246
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

248
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:02,706
Let's go find out.

249
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:05,292
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER
on his own...

250
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:11,256
He asks the nurse, "Hey, where they
keep the Coke machine?"

251
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:14,802
- Did she tell him?
- Tom, what do we got on the car so far?

252
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:18,639
We found the registration in the
glove box. Owner is Katherine Markum.

253
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:20,349
- Oh, shit.
- You know her?

254
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:23,101
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

255
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:26,980
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

256
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:31,109
- Oh, fuck, that's her.
- Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

257
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:35,614
When we were kids. Now it's just
a "hello" around the neighborhood.

258
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:39,618
Nineteen.

259
00:24:39,785 --> 00:24:41,578
Fuck, man.

260
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:44,331
He's in for a world of hurt.

261
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:14,111
Do not make her laugh.

262
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:24,246
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

263
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:28,709
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

264
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:33,171
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

265
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:35,382
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

266
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:38,510
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

267
00:25:38,677 --> 00:25:41,680
...hits her in the shoulder,
maybe the bicep.

268
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:45,058
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds...

269
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:49,938
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I dig that.

270
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:53,150
Body of Christ.

271
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:56,486
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

272
00:25:57,738 --> 00:26:00,782
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

273
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,539
Body of Christ.

274
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,709
Body of Christ.

275
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,212
Body of Christ.

276
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:19,301
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

277
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:20,927
The killer shows, she bolts.

278
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:24,681
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

279
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:28,101
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

280
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:37,235
Body of Christ.

281
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,656
Body of Christ.

282
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:55,212
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

283
00:26:55,378 --> 00:26:59,424
No, I haven't seen him since we
were kids. Once in a while, I run into him.

284
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,260
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

285
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:06,389
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

286
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,099
This dress itches.

287
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:11,937
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

288
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:14,439
We are so proud of you.

289
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,794
Morning, honey.

290
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:40,131
Dave, there's nothing about it
in the papers. I checked three times.

291
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:43,468
It was late, real late.

292
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:47,848
- Morning, Mikey.
- Morning, Dad.

293
00:27:48,723 --> 00:27:52,644
- You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

294
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:55,981
Come on.

295
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:00,986
Put your coat on, Mike.

296
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,280
Thanks, Mom.

297
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,960
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's up, Ed?

298
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:19,838
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

299
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:24,217
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

300
00:28:24,384 --> 00:28:27,178
- Nadine's First Communion.
- What are you doing here?

301
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:29,889
Just curious, I guess.

302
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:43,361
That's my daughter's car.

303
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,491
That's my daughter's car.

304
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:54,080
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

305
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,999
- Want to take a walk over?
- Yeah.

306
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,335
<i>- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

307
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,837
<i>We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.</i>

308
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:02,464
Oh, shit.

309
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,175
<i>- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.</i>

310
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:08,219
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

311
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:11,890
<i>Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.</i>

312
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,808
<i>And he's got some guys with him.</i>

313
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:17,270
<i>- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.</i>

314
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:21,941
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

315
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,943
All right, I'm on my way.

316
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:30,408
- Hey, guys.
- That's our niece in there.

317
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:32,243
- Let us in.
- We're doing our job.

318
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,703
- Let us in.
- Fuck you!

319
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,580
The doughnut shop's that way!

320
00:29:35,747 --> 00:29:38,541
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

321
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,752
- Enough.
- Nick.

322
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,090
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

323
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,842
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

324
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:51,638
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

325
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:53,932
- But get answers.
- You got it.

326
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:01,314
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

327
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:05,485
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

328
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:08,279
- Is she in there?
- All we're doing is looking.

329
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:12,075
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

330
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:15,328
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

331
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:19,791
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

332
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:24,629
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

333
00:30:24,796 --> 00:30:27,048
<i>- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.</i>

334
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:30,176
<i>Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.</i>

335
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:34,138
<i>- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.</i>

336
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:36,140
All right.

337
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:38,309
Make sure he doesn't get through.

338
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:40,937
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

339
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:45,066
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

340
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,026
Go.

341
00:30:50,822 --> 00:30:54,909
<i>There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.</i>

342
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:57,745
<i>All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...</i>

343
00:30:57,912 --> 00:31:00,832
<i>...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.</i>

344
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:05,336
<i>Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...</i>

345
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:08,840
<i>...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.</i>

346
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:12,302
<i>We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.</i>

347
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,849
<i>Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.</i>

348
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:20,727
Ready? Bat back.

349
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:25,607
All the way back.

350
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:39,329
I never saw anything like that before.

351
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,873
What do we got?

352
00:31:51,424 --> 00:31:53,551
Oh, Christ.

353
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,530
Is that her?

354
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:18,785
Yeah.

355
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:23,039
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

356
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:25,625
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

357
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:28,669
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

358
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:33,257
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a.38.

359
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,928
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

360
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:39,138
"Hey, Jimmy...

361
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:43,309
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect."

362
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:48,439
- Hey.
- Hold on!

363
00:32:48,606 --> 00:32:52,902
- Grab him. Stop that guy.
- Hey, you!

364
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:55,321
- I'm fucking going in there!
- Take it easy!

365
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:57,824
- Get his arms.
- Hold him. Come on.

366
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,326
- Let me in, you motherfuckers!
- Take it easy.

367
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,414
- Let me in!
- Is she in there?!

368
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:10,461
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

369
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:14,132
Is my daughter in there?! Is she in there?!
Is she in there?!

370
00:33:14,298 --> 00:33:16,509
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

371
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:20,138
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

372
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:23,307
Is that my daughter in there?!

373
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:26,644
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

374
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:31,357
- Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

375
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:34,318
Is that my daughter in there?

376
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:37,864
No! No!

377
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:43,161
Oh, no!

378
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:45,830
No, God!

379
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:49,417
Oh, God, no!

380
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,880
No one's said anything, right?

381
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:37,715
What do you mean?

382
00:34:37,882 --> 00:34:42,428
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

383
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,555
Jimmy?

384
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:46,349
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

385
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:50,227
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

386
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:32,853
That's her.

387
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:36,399
That's Katie.

388
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:39,985
That's my daughter.

389
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:02,091
Fresh-brewed.

390
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:04,718
So we need to work a time line.

391
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:07,221
It's details, little things
that make a case.

392
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:11,142
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

393
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:17,064
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

394
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:20,151
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

395
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:23,404
At the last minute, she changed her mind.

396
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:26,782
See what I mean?

397
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:29,493
What do you mean, Jimmy?

398
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:35,166
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

399
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:37,209
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

400
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:42,673
If I'd gotten into that car that day,
my life would have been a different thing.

401
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:46,677
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

402
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:49,805
...she was a beautiful woman.

403
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:52,224
Regal.

404
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:55,644
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

405
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:58,314
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

406
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,651
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

407
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:05,571
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

408
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:08,532
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

409
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:11,744
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

410
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:15,080
And Katie never would have been born.

411
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:18,375
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

412
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:28,677
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

413
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:35,643
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

414
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,311
Around 7:30.

415
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:40,439
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

416
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:47,237
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

417
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:50,449
She was having dinner with her friends.

418
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:56,914
- Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

419
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:00,918
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

420
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:04,588
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

421
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:07,132
And then around 8, she left.

422
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:10,427
- Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

423
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:14,348
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

424
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:16,767
- No, go ahead.
- Good.

425
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:21,313
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

426
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:24,566
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

427
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:27,778
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

428
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:31,198
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

429
00:38:31,365 --> 00:38:33,158
She what?

430
00:38:34,743 --> 00:38:36,453
It's nothing.

431
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:39,790
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

432
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:44,044
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

433
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:47,881
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

434
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:51,301
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

435
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:55,681
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

436
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:59,810
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

437
00:38:59,977 --> 00:39:02,646
- Okay.
- It was just a look.

438
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:08,026
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

439
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,486
You were in prison?

440
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:10,946
- Oh, Jesus.
- Here we go.

441
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,449
- Whitey.
- I'm just asking.

442
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:17,828
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

443
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,831
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

444
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:24,835
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

445
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:28,297
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

446
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:30,757
Okay, Mr. Markum.

447
00:39:30,924 --> 00:39:34,428
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

448
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:39,057
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

449
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:48,442
There was this kid.

450
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,069
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

451
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:53,363
What? Remember, it's the little things.

452
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:57,951
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

453
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:00,913
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

454
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,873
- No.
- What makes you so sure?

455
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,584
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

456
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:08,545
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

457
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:12,007
No one right now, as far as we know.

458
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:15,260
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you what you need tomorrow.

459
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:18,722
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

460
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:23,518
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

461
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:28,023
And if you think of anything...

462
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,860
...anything at all, give us a call.

463
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:40,160
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

464
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:44,247
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

465
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:46,291
This car came up and took Dave away.

466
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:49,294
- Abduction?
- Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

467
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:53,715
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

468
00:40:53,882 --> 00:40:55,717
- They catch these guys?
- One died.

469
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:58,762
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

470
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:02,933
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

471
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,269
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

472
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:09,189
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

473
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:13,735
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

474
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:23,787
Cause of death: gunshot wound to the
head, not the trauma from the beating.

475
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:28,125
- What else?
- Her and her friends were barhopping.

476
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,336
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

477
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:34,131
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

478
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:37,300
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

479
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:39,761
It doesn't sound like much.

480
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:42,139
What do you say, Devine?

481
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,559
We'll get the guy, sir.

482
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:49,855
That's right. All right, let's do it.

483
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:58,655
- That's the best you can come up with?
- It made him happy, didn't it?

484
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:02,784
This is Sean.

485
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:06,955
- Hello?
- Is it Lauren?

486
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:12,544
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

487
00:42:15,005 --> 00:42:16,715
Is he with you?

488
00:42:23,263 --> 00:42:25,432
Is that the baby?

489
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,977
Lauren, at least tell me her name.

490
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,490
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

491
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,047
Hey.

492
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:02,844
Would it surprise you?

493
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:04,930
Wouldn't be the first time.

494
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:11,061
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that...?

495
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:13,230
Did you see her?

496
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:16,733
- I heard a car hit something.
- Hit what? Another car?

497
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,778
- Oh, no, not loud like that.
- Like hitting the curb?

498
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,821
Yes, maybe.

499
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:24,950
Then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi."

500
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:27,244
- Someone said, "Hi"?
- "Hi."

501
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:30,914
Then there was a loud crack.

502
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:34,793
- Could it have been a gunshot?
- Yes, maybe.

503
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,338
- Did you look out your window?
- Oh, no.

504
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:41,466
I was in my dressing gown by then.

505
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:45,095
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

506
00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:47,931
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

507
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:50,558
Female.

508
00:43:50,725 --> 00:43:52,102
I think.

509
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:56,022
- It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
- Yeah.

510
00:43:56,189 --> 00:43:58,441
Sorry to trouble you.

511
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:08,910
- Jimmy.
- Theo.

512
00:44:09,077 --> 00:44:11,413
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

513
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,581
- She's trying.
- Let's get these on ice.

514
00:44:13,748 --> 00:44:16,126
You got a couple of coolers?

515
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,300
Right here's fine.

516
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:32,851
So how are you handling all this so far?

517
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:35,979
- It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
- Yeah?

518
00:44:36,146 --> 00:44:38,565
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

519
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:42,485
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

520
00:44:42,652 --> 00:44:46,448
...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

521
00:44:46,614 --> 00:44:50,326
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

522
00:44:52,412 --> 00:44:54,330
Domestic responsibilities?

523
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:59,794
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

524
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:02,964
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

525
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:05,717
It just needed to be said, that's all.

526
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:09,971
You'll come through
because you're a man.

527
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:12,307
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

528
00:45:12,474 --> 00:45:15,727
I said, "You got yourself
a real old-school man there."

529
00:45:15,894 --> 00:45:18,521
- Like they put her in a bag.
- What?

530
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:21,900
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

531
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:26,029
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

532
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,866
- Well...
- Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

533
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:33,203
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

534
00:45:33,536 --> 00:45:38,249
- You don't need to talk about Janey.
- My daughter was murdered.

535
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:42,086
They put a gun to her. As we stand here,
she's on an autopsy slab...

536
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:45,048
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

537
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:48,885
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

538
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:54,933
Good to see you, Theo.

539
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:02,565
Eve, just tell them what they
want to know.

540
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:05,693
- Who was she dating?
- We already told the Savages.

541
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,613
- The Savage brothers?
- They were here yesterday.

542
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,158
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

543
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:14,619
No one special.

544
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:21,251
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

545
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:24,379
- What?
- She was leaving town, wasn't she?

546
00:46:24,546 --> 00:46:27,924
- Going to Las Vegas?
- How do you know?

547
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:32,929
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

548
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,100
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

549
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:40,770
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

550
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:43,815
So who was she going with?

551
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:48,069
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

552
00:46:48,945 --> 00:46:50,238
Brendan.

553
00:46:50,571 --> 00:46:52,615
Excuse me?

554
00:46:52,782 --> 00:46:56,160
- Brendan.
- Brendan Harris?

555
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:58,788
Brendan Harris, yeah.

556
00:46:58,997 --> 00:47:00,790
You got an address?

557
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:16,264
Hey, Dave.

558
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:22,061
Hey, Jimmy.

559
00:47:22,228 --> 00:47:25,690
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

560
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:29,402
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

561
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:37,994
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

562
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:40,830
How you doing?

563
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,166
How you doing?

564
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:46,586
What happened to your hand?

565
00:47:47,503 --> 00:47:49,088
This?

566
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:54,343
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

567
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:58,181
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

568
00:48:00,516 --> 00:48:02,185
It's good to see you.

569
00:48:02,977 --> 00:48:04,312
Yeah?

570
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:12,528
How are our girls holding up?

571
00:48:12,695 --> 00:48:14,822
They're doing okay, I guess.

572
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:18,326
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

573
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:34,008
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

574
00:48:36,302 --> 00:48:37,595
Yeah.

575
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:46,562
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge
to find room for all that food...

576
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:49,690
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

577
00:48:49,982 --> 00:48:53,194
- Lot of waste, huh?
- Yeah.

578
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,825
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

579
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:03,913
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

580
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:13,589
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

581
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:16,884
...that girl was neat.

582
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:21,806
When I got out of the joint...

583
00:49:23,182 --> 00:49:26,102
...you know, after Marita died...

584
00:49:27,603 --> 00:49:32,608
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

585
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:36,445
...than I ever was of being in prison.

586
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:47,123
I loved her...

587
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:50,334
...most...

588
00:49:53,004 --> 00:49:56,507
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

589
00:49:59,385 --> 00:50:05,516
...it was like we were the last two people
on Earth. You know, forgotten.

590
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:08,311
Unwanted.

591
00:50:10,396 --> 00:50:14,775
And it's really starting to piss me off,
Dave, because I can't cry for her.

592
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:19,030
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

593
00:50:23,993 --> 00:50:25,786
Jimmy.

594
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:31,792
You're crying now.

595
00:50:35,004 --> 00:50:37,173
Yeah, damn.

596
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:45,181
I just want to hug her one more time.

597
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:52,605
She was 19 fucking years old.

598
00:50:59,904 --> 00:51:01,864
Do you want me to leave you alone?

599
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:05,409
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

600
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:10,206
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

601
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:29,850
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

602
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:33,604
- You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
- She isn't hurt. She's dead.

603
00:51:36,899 --> 00:51:40,569
- I didn't kill her.
- Again, when's the last time you saw her?

604
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,075
About 8...
Saturday night, about 8:00.

605
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:48,369
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

606
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:50,913
It was about 8.

607
00:51:51,914 --> 00:51:56,919
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

608
00:51:57,253 --> 00:52:00,589
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

609
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:03,801
I don't know.

610
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:09,431
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

611
00:52:09,598 --> 00:52:13,519
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

612
00:52:13,686 --> 00:52:17,982
- He's not a thief.
- He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

613
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:22,319
Daughter probably had the same bad
gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.

614
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:27,616
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

615
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:31,787
We were gonna leave Sunday.

616
00:52:32,997 --> 00:52:35,916
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

617
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:40,504
Well, that was the plan, right?

618
00:52:40,796 --> 00:52:43,674
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

619
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:46,969
- Ma, I was gonna tell you.
- Just like your father, huh?

620
00:52:53,976 --> 00:52:58,147
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

621
00:52:58,314 --> 00:53:00,691
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.

622
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:02,651
He don't speak.

623
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:07,156
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

624
00:53:07,323 --> 00:53:11,452
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

625
00:53:12,745 --> 00:53:16,957
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 A.M. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

626
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,043
I was asleep.

627
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:21,003
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

628
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:27,968
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

629
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:30,929
He came down for breakfast at 9.

630
00:53:31,764 --> 00:53:36,393
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

631
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,731
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a
polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?

632
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,944
I loved her so much.

633
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,741
I'm never gonna feel that again.

634
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:53,702
It doesn't happen twice.

635
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:58,165
Doesn't happen once most times.

636
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,543
Celeste.

637
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:06,715
- Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
- What are you still doing here?

638
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:11,178
I don't know.

639
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,973
I don't know, I just...

640
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:18,018
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

641
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:20,896
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

642
00:54:21,063 --> 00:54:24,066
- Could I get one of those?
- Yeah.

643
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:31,698
One for the road and then home.

644
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:40,749
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

645
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,751
You've done enough.

646
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:49,258
To you and Dave for being here for this.

647
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:09,778
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

648
00:55:11,113 --> 00:55:14,032
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

649
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:15,868
Good night.

650
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:19,454
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

651
00:55:39,141 --> 00:55:40,559
Hello?

652
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:47,357
Christ. Lauren, say something.

653
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,325
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?"

654
00:55:57,034 --> 00:56:00,787
<i>Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things
made sense.</i>

655
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:03,206
<i>I'm tired of caring about
some dead girl...</i>

656
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:06,126
<i>...and there's just gonna be
another one after her.</i>

657
00:56:07,294 --> 00:56:11,757
Sending killers to jail is sending them
where they've been heading all their lives.

658
00:56:11,923 --> 00:56:13,967
The dead are still dead.

659
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:18,930
Jesus, I...

660
00:56:19,097 --> 00:56:21,224
...can't do this tonight.

661
00:56:21,516 --> 00:56:23,310
I just...

662
00:56:24,353 --> 00:56:26,146
I can't do it.

663
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,315
Bye, baby.

664
00:56:38,992 --> 00:56:40,619
Because...

665
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:45,248
...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.

666
00:56:45,457 --> 00:56:47,167
He was the boy.

667
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:51,129
The boy who escaped from wolves.

668
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:54,800
An animal of the dusk.

669
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:56,968
Invisible.

670
00:56:57,386 --> 00:56:59,262
Silent.

671
00:56:59,846 --> 00:57:01,932
Living in a world...

672
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,518
...the others never saw.

673
00:57:06,395 --> 00:57:08,897
World of fireflies.

674
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:14,945
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

675
00:57:15,654 --> 00:57:20,075
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

676
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:36,466
I just gotta get my head right.

677
00:57:39,427 --> 00:57:42,639
Catch a nice, long sleep.

678
00:57:43,098 --> 00:57:46,101
And the boy will go back to his forest.

679
00:57:48,186 --> 00:57:51,273
Back to his fireflies.

680
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:00,282
Is he asleep?

681
00:58:21,887 --> 00:58:24,306
How's Jimmy and everybody?

682
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,100
Okay.

683
00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:29,144
It's weird.

684
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:33,523
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

685
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,151
Dave? Dave.

686
00:58:39,404 --> 00:58:41,364
There's still nothing in the paper.

687
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,742
About what?

688
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:45,952
About what?

689
00:58:48,663 --> 00:58:52,918
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

690
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:55,962
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

691
00:58:59,007 --> 00:59:00,675
Yeah.

692
00:59:00,842 --> 00:59:02,385
Right.

693
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:07,307
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

694
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:10,685
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

695
00:59:11,853 --> 00:59:14,564
That seems more important right now.

696
00:59:43,718 --> 00:59:47,555
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

697
00:59:48,556 --> 00:59:51,059
But I don't know how.

698
01:00:10,912 --> 01:00:12,747
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

699
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:15,583
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

700
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,085
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

701
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:21,256
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

702
01:00:21,423 --> 01:00:24,092
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

703
01:00:24,259 --> 01:00:27,011
Considering the crime, maybe.

704
01:00:27,262 --> 01:00:28,596
Dave Boyle?

705
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:32,225
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

706
01:00:32,684 --> 01:00:33,935
Could be.

707
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:37,605
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

708
01:00:37,772 --> 01:00:41,484
- Clam up for no reason, huh?
- We'll see.

709
01:00:52,745 --> 01:00:54,372
Hey, Boyle!

710
01:00:55,123 --> 01:00:57,500
- What's it been, seven, eight years?
- Yeah.

711
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,169
Yeah. How you doing?

712
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,795
This is my son, Michael.

713
01:01:00,962 --> 01:01:03,339
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

714
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:06,384
I'm an old buddy of your dad's.
Hi.

715
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:10,305
- So you still with the staties?
- Homicide. This is my partner.

716
01:01:10,471 --> 01:01:13,183
- Sergeant Powers. How are you?
- So you got a minute?

717
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:17,645
- We'd love to ask some quick questions.
- I was just gonna walk Michael to school.

718
01:01:17,812 --> 01:01:21,733
- I can be back in a few minutes.
- Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?

719
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,401
Sure.

720
01:01:24,986 --> 01:01:26,779
So you look good.

721
01:01:27,322 --> 01:01:30,325
- I hear rents are rising.
- Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

722
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:33,119
They're cutting my dad's old house up
into condos.

723
01:01:33,286 --> 01:01:35,079
We walked by there the other day.

724
01:01:35,246 --> 01:01:37,498
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

725
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:40,084
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

726
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:44,714
"Neighborhood needs a crime wave.
Get property values where they belong."

727
01:01:44,881 --> 01:01:49,385
Girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.

728
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:52,055
Dave. Call me Dave.

729
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:54,182
You said the F-word, Dad.

730
01:01:54,557 --> 01:01:57,352
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.

731
01:01:57,518 --> 01:02:00,688
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

732
01:02:00,855 --> 01:02:04,859
- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

733
01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:07,946
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

734
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:10,239
- Who's Celeste?
- My wife.

735
01:02:10,406 --> 01:02:14,661
- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

736
01:02:14,827 --> 01:02:18,206
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

737
01:02:18,998 --> 01:02:23,419
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

738
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:25,588
That's what we wanted to talk about.

739
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:29,717
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

740
01:02:29,884 --> 01:02:32,178
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

741
01:02:32,345 --> 01:02:35,890
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

742
01:02:36,057 --> 01:02:39,102
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

743
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:40,853
What time did they leave?

744
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,065
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

745
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:47,360
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

746
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:51,030
You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

747
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:52,865
Michael.

748
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:55,076
Like what?
I don't know.

749
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:56,577
A guy watching the girls?

750
01:02:56,744 --> 01:02:59,580
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

751
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:05,586
No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

752
01:03:05,753 --> 01:03:09,090
- See you later, Dad.
- You got your milk money?

753
01:03:16,097 --> 01:03:18,099
Fuck, I hated school.

754
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:20,143
What?

755
01:03:21,561 --> 01:03:24,647
Yeah, me too, Sean.

756
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:30,319
Just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

757
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:33,614
- Home.
- Home by 1: 15, would you say?

758
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:36,576
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

759
01:03:38,286 --> 01:03:41,330
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

760
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:44,959
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
- All right.

761
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:53,217
What?

762
01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:55,970
What happened to him in that car?

763
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:05,146
Can you believe this?

764
01:04:05,313 --> 01:04:09,317
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

765
01:04:10,902 --> 01:04:14,363
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

766
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,449
...you're not left with a whole lot.

767
01:04:16,616 --> 01:04:19,202
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

768
01:04:19,368 --> 01:04:23,581
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

769
01:04:23,748 --> 01:04:25,708
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

770
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:29,128
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

771
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:33,925
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

772
01:04:34,091 --> 01:04:37,970
- She says, "Hi." He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

773
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:40,806
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

774
01:04:40,973 --> 01:04:43,601
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

775
01:04:43,768 --> 01:04:47,021
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

776
01:04:47,188 --> 01:04:51,484
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

777
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:55,196
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

778
01:04:55,363 --> 01:04:58,574
Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

779
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:01,452
- We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

780
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,455
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

781
01:05:04,622 --> 01:05:06,749
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

782
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:10,586
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

783
01:05:10,753 --> 01:05:12,922
Just a little one.

784
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:22,181
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,
from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

785
01:05:22,348 --> 01:05:24,517
- Sure.
- Good.

786
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:30,856
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

787
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,525
Good.

788
01:05:37,905 --> 01:05:39,824
And the notice?

789
01:05:40,658 --> 01:05:42,034
Notice?

790
01:05:43,411 --> 01:05:48,290
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

791
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:51,043
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

792
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,920
Where's my daughter?

793
01:05:55,423 --> 01:05:57,466
Downstairs, in the basement.

794
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,593
I wanna see her.

795
01:06:46,974 --> 01:06:49,310
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

796
01:06:50,728 --> 01:06:53,814
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

797
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,817
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

798
01:07:00,738 --> 01:07:03,324
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

799
01:07:06,785 --> 01:07:08,704
The notice.

800
01:07:09,997 --> 01:07:12,374
It should read: "Katherine Markum...

801
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:17,546
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

802
01:07:18,297 --> 01:07:22,551
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to..."

803
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:26,347
"Sister to Sara and Nadine."

804
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,766
- You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

805
01:08:11,725 --> 01:08:14,019
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

806
01:08:14,186 --> 01:08:16,939
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

807
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:20,109
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

808
01:08:20,276 --> 01:08:24,905
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm
gonna go get some. See you in a minute.

809
01:08:25,072 --> 01:08:28,909
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

810
01:08:30,577 --> 01:08:35,374
Garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck
my hand in, it started again.

811
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:37,251
- Stupid.
- Painful.

812
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:43,924
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

813
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:48,095
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

814
01:09:01,692 --> 01:09:04,737
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

815
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:10,451
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

816
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:14,163
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

817
01:09:19,376 --> 01:09:22,504
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

818
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:25,340
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

819
01:09:25,507 --> 01:09:26,675
- Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

820
01:09:26,842 --> 01:09:28,302
Yeah.

821
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:31,889
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

822
01:09:32,055 --> 01:09:35,100
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

823
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:36,769
Look, I gotta go.

824
01:09:39,646 --> 01:09:43,358
Oh, damn it.
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

825
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:46,111
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

826
01:09:46,945 --> 01:09:48,405
Come on.

827
01:09:53,494 --> 01:09:56,997
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

828
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:59,958
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

829
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:01,752
- What?
- It's a little thing.

830
01:10:01,919 --> 01:10:05,672
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

831
01:10:05,839 --> 01:10:07,883
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

832
01:10:09,468 --> 01:10:11,637
You think Dave killed Katie?

833
01:10:12,095 --> 01:10:15,349
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

834
01:10:17,768 --> 01:10:21,188
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

835
01:10:21,355 --> 01:10:24,942
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

836
01:10:25,108 --> 01:10:28,278
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

837
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:31,907
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

838
01:10:32,366 --> 01:10:33,867
I was asleep.

839
01:10:36,537 --> 01:10:41,750
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

840
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:44,253
Okay. Well, thanks.

841
01:10:54,972 --> 01:10:56,723
Bullshit.

842
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:58,392
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

843
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:02,229
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

844
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:04,106
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

845
01:11:04,648 --> 01:11:05,899
Remember what you said?

846
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,904
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

847
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:16,368
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

848
01:11:16,535 --> 01:11:18,120
You're 100 percent sure?

849
01:11:18,787 --> 01:11:23,083
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

850
01:11:26,086 --> 01:11:29,006
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

851
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:31,591
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

852
01:11:31,758 --> 01:11:35,429
He said Katie told him you'd disown her
if she ever dated a Harris.

853
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:40,267
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

854
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:41,768
Why is that?

855
01:11:43,812 --> 01:11:46,440
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

856
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:50,777
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

857
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:54,948
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray."

858
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:57,951
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

859
01:11:58,785 --> 01:12:03,623
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

860
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:05,792
I don't know.

861
01:12:06,126 --> 01:12:08,962
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

862
01:12:09,254 --> 01:12:14,301
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any daughter of mine.

863
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:19,264
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

864
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:21,975
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

865
01:12:22,142 --> 01:12:24,311
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

866
01:12:24,478 --> 01:12:28,482
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

867
01:12:28,648 --> 01:12:32,152
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

868
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,614
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

869
01:12:35,781 --> 01:12:39,534
- Some people don't talk to policemen.
- With all due respect...

870
01:12:39,701 --> 01:12:42,204
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

871
01:12:42,954 --> 01:12:45,373
- How long?
- How long what?

872
01:12:45,707 --> 01:12:48,168
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

873
01:12:48,335 --> 01:12:49,669
You bargaining with us?

874
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:52,798
Bargaining?

875
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:56,343
You giving us a deadline?

876
01:12:59,346 --> 01:13:03,183
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

877
01:13:04,434 --> 01:13:08,939
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

878
01:13:12,734 --> 01:13:16,696
The last thing we need is Markum
and the Savages putting the fear of God...

879
01:13:16,863 --> 01:13:19,908
...into the neighborhood.
- We grew up terrified of those brothers.

880
01:13:20,075 --> 01:13:23,703
Eleven months apart, like their mother ran
a loose-cannon factory.

881
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:26,331
Fucking knuckleheads.

882
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:31,461
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

883
01:13:31,628 --> 01:13:35,006
- Yeah, you got a match?
- You're gonna love it.

884
01:13:36,174 --> 01:13:39,553
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a.38 Smith.

885
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:44,015
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

886
01:13:44,182 --> 01:13:49,312
The gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

887
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:50,855
- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

888
01:13:51,022 --> 01:13:55,652
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

889
01:13:55,819 --> 01:13:59,906
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

890
01:14:00,073 --> 01:14:03,702
- That's where the bullet got pulled.
- Nice work.

891
01:14:03,868 --> 01:14:06,037
Thought you'd like that.

892
01:14:35,734 --> 01:14:37,652
It's okay, Ray.

893
01:14:38,445 --> 01:14:40,280
Don't worry about it.

894
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:55,628
Ma said that?

895
01:14:58,214 --> 01:14:59,466
That I'm better off?

896
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:08,308
I loved her!
You know what that's like?

897
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:09,976
Huh?

898
01:15:15,148 --> 01:15:16,983
I'm sorry.

899
01:15:25,075 --> 01:15:26,910
No, you're wrong.

900
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:30,330
I won't ever feel that again.

901
01:15:31,122 --> 01:15:36,294
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

902
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:40,340
- Scary, huh?
- Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

903
01:15:40,507 --> 01:15:43,051
So take me through it.
These two guys come in...

904
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:47,097
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

905
01:15:49,432 --> 01:15:51,976
That's the storeroom.

906
01:15:52,977 --> 01:15:56,689
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

907
01:15:56,981 --> 01:15:59,192
I always keep that door locked.

908
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:02,862
So they must have had a key.

909
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:07,033
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

910
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:11,496
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

911
01:16:11,663 --> 01:16:16,376
The only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known...

912
01:16:16,793 --> 01:16:18,545
...I kept this under the counter.

913
01:16:18,711 --> 01:16:22,340
- And you told the police that at the time.
- Yeah.

914
01:16:23,258 --> 01:16:25,802
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

915
01:16:25,969 --> 01:16:28,555
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

916
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:31,808
- Never made an arrest.
- Still have a copy of those records?

917
01:16:31,975 --> 01:16:36,896
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

918
01:16:37,063 --> 01:16:38,565
Oh, yeah?

919
01:16:38,731 --> 01:16:41,442
This guy I fired a couple
of weeks before.

920
01:16:41,609 --> 01:16:45,530
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

921
01:16:45,697 --> 01:16:49,909
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

922
01:16:50,076 --> 01:16:52,161
And I just knew.

923
01:16:52,328 --> 01:16:55,081
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

924
01:16:55,748 --> 01:16:57,584
You remember his name?

925
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:00,545
Do I look senile to you?

926
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,214
- No, sir.
- Name...

927
01:17:03,423 --> 01:17:05,425
...was Ray Harris.

928
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,845
We used to call him "Just Ray."

929
01:17:11,598 --> 01:17:14,642
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

930
01:17:15,643 --> 01:17:19,355
- That's correct, sir.
- Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

931
01:17:31,284 --> 01:17:33,161
Where you been?

932
01:17:34,454 --> 01:17:36,164
Out.

933
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:41,419
What you watching?

934
01:17:41,586 --> 01:17:43,671
Some vampire movie.

935
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,966
Guy just got his head torn off.

936
01:17:48,718 --> 01:17:50,887
Where'd you go, Celeste?

937
01:17:55,224 --> 01:17:57,477
I was sitting in my car...

938
01:17:57,935 --> 01:18:01,105
...down by the channel.
You know...

939
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:03,149
...thinking about things.

940
01:18:04,984 --> 01:18:08,363
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

941
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:11,783
No, actually, I don't know.

942
01:18:17,497 --> 01:18:20,833
Things. You know, the day.

943
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,296
About Katie being dead.

944
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,716
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy,
you know...

945
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:31,302
...those things.

946
01:18:31,677 --> 01:18:33,679
Those things.

947
01:18:34,472 --> 01:18:36,891
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

948
01:18:38,518 --> 01:18:40,061
Vampires.

949
01:18:41,771 --> 01:18:43,022
What about them?

950
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:48,027
They're undead...

951
01:18:48,194 --> 01:18:51,280
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

952
01:18:51,447 --> 01:18:54,992
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

953
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:57,036
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

954
01:18:58,454 --> 01:19:00,706
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

955
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,417
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

956
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:05,711
You're not making any sense.

957
01:19:08,756 --> 01:19:10,508
You think I killed Katie?

958
01:19:10,675 --> 01:19:12,802
- Celeste.
- What...?

959
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:17,223
- That the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

960
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:20,768
You've barely looked at me since you
found out Katie was dead.

961
01:19:20,935 --> 01:19:22,687
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

962
01:19:22,854 --> 01:19:24,605
- Dave!
- What?

963
01:19:24,772 --> 01:19:29,527
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

964
01:19:29,694 --> 01:19:31,487
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

965
01:19:31,654 --> 01:19:33,739
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

966
01:19:33,906 --> 01:19:38,578
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

967
01:19:39,245 --> 01:19:42,582
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

968
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:46,669
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

969
01:19:46,836 --> 01:19:49,755
- Why not tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

970
01:19:49,922 --> 01:19:52,550
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

971
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:55,928
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

972
01:19:56,095 --> 01:19:57,763
I must have killed her, right?

973
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,891
Fuck!

974
01:20:27,668 --> 01:20:29,170
Henry...

975
01:20:29,795 --> 01:20:32,298
What? Henry?

976
01:20:34,592 --> 01:20:37,053
Henry and George.

977
01:20:40,765 --> 01:20:42,975
I never told anyone that before.

978
01:20:44,852 --> 01:20:46,312
Those were their names.

979
01:20:47,897 --> 01:20:50,483
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

980
01:20:53,653 --> 01:20:56,656
At least that's what they called
themselves, but...

981
01:20:57,823 --> 01:21:01,369
...they were wolves, and Dave...

982
01:21:02,036 --> 01:21:06,082
...was the boy who escaped from wolves.

983
01:21:08,292 --> 01:21:10,461
What are you talking about, Dave?

984
01:21:11,003 --> 01:21:13,381
I'm talking Henry and George.

985
01:21:14,382 --> 01:21:17,176
They took me on a four-day ride.

986
01:21:17,885 --> 01:21:23,224
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

987
01:21:24,058 --> 01:21:26,977
And, man, Celeste...

988
01:21:27,186 --> 01:21:28,896
...did they have their fun.

989
01:21:30,856 --> 01:21:34,235
And no one came to help old Dave then.

990
01:21:36,237 --> 01:21:41,033
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.

991
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:48,666
You mean, all those years ago...

992
01:21:51,544 --> 01:21:53,963
...when you were a little boy?

993
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:57,258
Dave...

994
01:21:57,424 --> 01:21:59,510
Dave's dead.

995
01:22:00,886 --> 01:22:05,015
I don't know who came out of that cellar,
but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

996
01:22:06,392 --> 01:22:07,810
You see, honey...

997
01:22:07,977 --> 01:22:09,478
Fuck!

998
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:12,356
It's like vampires.

999
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:17,403
Once it's in you...

1000
01:22:18,821 --> 01:22:20,739
...it stays.

1001
01:22:22,116 --> 01:22:24,160
What stays?

1002
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:34,044
Did you know there were child prostitutes
in Rome Basin?

1003
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,380
What?

1004
01:22:42,178 --> 01:22:43,679
Fuck!

1005
01:22:46,932 --> 01:22:49,935
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1006
01:22:50,102 --> 01:22:52,104
I'm warning you...

1007
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:55,774
...I can't trust my mind.

1008
01:22:58,736 --> 01:23:02,698
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1009
01:23:04,491 --> 01:23:05,993
Okay.

1010
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:12,041
Okay.

1011
01:23:12,499 --> 01:23:13,918
Okay.

1012
01:23:15,628 --> 01:23:19,506
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

1013
01:23:19,673 --> 01:23:22,259
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1014
01:23:22,426 --> 01:23:24,219
These things get passed around.

1015
01:23:24,386 --> 01:23:27,348
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1016
01:23:27,514 --> 01:23:30,434
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1017
01:23:30,601 --> 01:23:34,688
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1018
01:23:34,855 --> 01:23:39,318
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1019
01:23:39,485 --> 01:23:43,656
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1020
01:23:43,822 --> 01:23:47,993
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

1021
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,496
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1022
01:23:50,663 --> 01:23:54,041
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1023
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:58,212
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1024
01:23:58,379 --> 01:23:59,672
He's not my friend.

1025
01:23:59,838 --> 01:24:04,343
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1026
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:20,567
Hey, Jimmy.

1027
01:24:21,819 --> 01:24:23,362
You're out late.

1028
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:25,239
Yeah, you too.

1029
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:28,492
It's cold, huh?

1030
01:24:28,742 --> 01:24:30,994
Yeah, I guess.

1031
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,045
You know, I...

1032
01:24:40,546 --> 01:24:42,589
I been sitting out here...

1033
01:24:42,756 --> 01:24:44,883
...over the last few years...

1034
01:24:46,802 --> 01:24:50,889
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1035
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:56,895
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while."

1036
01:25:01,442 --> 01:25:03,277
Weird thing is...

1037
01:25:04,153 --> 01:25:06,238
...it seemed to bring her back.

1038
01:25:10,742 --> 01:25:12,786
I saw her, you know.

1039
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:16,290
Saw who?

1040
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:19,626
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1041
01:25:21,628 --> 01:25:25,757
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1042
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,429
Did you talk to her?

1043
01:25:31,263 --> 01:25:33,765
Just nodded hello at one point.

1044
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,102
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1045
01:25:43,317 --> 01:25:44,818
But...

1046
01:25:44,985 --> 01:25:46,570
...Jimmy...

1047
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:49,948
...she looked...

1048
01:25:51,283 --> 01:25:52,784
...happy.

1049
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:12,971
I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1050
01:26:24,858 --> 01:26:28,111
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1051
01:26:28,278 --> 01:26:32,115
- From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1052
01:26:32,282 --> 01:26:33,784
...adjacent to the parkway.

1053
01:26:33,951 --> 01:26:38,497
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1054
01:26:38,664 --> 01:26:42,250
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1055
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:47,339
After I left you last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1056
01:26:47,506 --> 01:26:52,302
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1057
01:26:52,469 --> 01:26:55,180
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1058
01:26:55,347 --> 01:26:59,184
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

1059
01:26:59,351 --> 01:27:02,187
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1060
01:27:02,354 --> 01:27:05,107
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1061
01:27:05,273 --> 01:27:08,026
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1062
01:27:08,193 --> 01:27:12,030
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1063
01:27:12,197 --> 01:27:17,077
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1064
01:27:17,244 --> 01:27:21,373
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1065
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,041
Bingo.

1066
01:27:23,709 --> 01:27:26,378
You wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1067
01:27:26,712 --> 01:27:29,715
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1068
01:27:29,881 --> 01:27:33,009
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1069
01:27:34,803 --> 01:27:36,054
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1070
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:39,433
We know you didn't get that swollen hand
sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1071
01:27:40,058 --> 01:27:44,855
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1072
01:27:45,397 --> 01:27:47,899
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1073
01:27:54,197 --> 01:27:57,075
How about a Sprite or something?

1074
01:27:57,242 --> 01:28:01,288
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1075
01:28:01,455 --> 01:28:02,998
You lied.

1076
01:28:03,165 --> 01:28:05,709
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1077
01:28:05,876 --> 01:28:10,755
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1078
01:28:10,922 --> 01:28:15,385
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1079
01:28:15,552 --> 01:28:17,137
Okay.

1080
01:28:18,638 --> 01:28:20,307
All right.

1081
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:23,935
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1082
01:28:24,102 --> 01:28:26,771
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1083
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:30,692
What are you looking at him for?

1084
01:28:32,152 --> 01:28:35,822
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1085
01:28:36,615 --> 01:28:38,116
Sure.

1086
01:28:38,408 --> 01:28:40,410
Oh, I get it.

1087
01:28:41,036 --> 01:28:42,871
You're the good cop.

1088
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:46,416
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1089
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:49,794
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1090
01:28:50,921 --> 01:28:54,174
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1091
01:28:56,343 --> 01:28:59,846
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1092
01:29:02,599 --> 01:29:05,727
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1093
01:29:05,894 --> 01:29:09,105
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1094
01:29:09,731 --> 01:29:13,902
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1095
01:29:14,069 --> 01:29:16,738
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1096
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:20,116
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1097
01:29:20,283 --> 01:29:22,077
Bled like hell.

1098
01:29:22,494 --> 01:29:25,747
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1099
01:29:26,331 --> 01:29:29,501
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1100
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:31,378
What blood type are you?

1101
01:29:32,045 --> 01:29:33,713
B-negative.

1102
01:29:33,964 --> 01:29:36,675
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1103
01:29:37,258 --> 01:29:39,344
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1104
01:29:39,511 --> 01:29:42,013
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1105
01:29:43,348 --> 01:29:46,184
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1106
01:29:46,851 --> 01:29:50,021
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1107
01:29:50,188 --> 01:29:53,358
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.

1108
01:29:53,525 --> 01:29:55,235
How will that look in court?

1109
01:29:55,402 --> 01:29:59,322
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

1110
01:29:59,489 --> 01:30:02,409
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1111
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:04,703
What report?

1112
01:30:05,078 --> 01:30:09,374
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

1113
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:12,794
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1114
01:30:12,961 --> 01:30:15,547
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1115
01:30:21,553 --> 01:30:25,056
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1116
01:30:25,306 --> 01:30:28,852
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1117
01:30:29,018 --> 01:30:31,688
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1118
01:30:31,855 --> 01:30:34,441
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1119
01:30:34,607 --> 01:30:36,776
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1120
01:30:36,943 --> 01:30:39,237
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1121
01:30:39,404 --> 01:30:43,408
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1122
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:46,077
Okay. Maybe.

1123
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:50,248
So, what do we do with Dave?

1124
01:30:51,916 --> 01:30:53,460
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1125
01:30:54,335 --> 01:30:58,256
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1126
01:30:58,465 --> 01:31:01,760
Or this lovely red marble here.

1127
01:31:02,594 --> 01:31:04,429
Or a figural.

1128
01:31:04,596 --> 01:31:06,181
That one.

1129
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:10,185
Very good. Nice and simple.

1130
01:31:18,651 --> 01:31:20,278
Hey, Jimmy!

1131
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:25,867
Annabeth said you were here.

1132
01:31:27,202 --> 01:31:29,329
We been asking around, like you said to.

1133
01:31:29,496 --> 01:31:31,039
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1134
01:31:31,206 --> 01:31:34,417
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1135
01:31:34,584 --> 01:31:37,670
And it ain't about me missing your brains
running things.

1136
01:31:37,837 --> 01:31:42,258
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1137
01:31:42,425 --> 01:31:44,969
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1138
01:31:46,346 --> 01:31:51,142
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1139
01:31:51,309 --> 01:31:54,771
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1140
01:31:54,938 --> 01:31:58,816
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1141
01:31:58,983 --> 01:32:02,862
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1142
01:32:03,112 --> 01:32:06,324
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1143
01:32:06,616 --> 01:32:09,160
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1144
01:32:11,162 --> 01:32:13,665
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1145
01:32:13,831 --> 01:32:17,502
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1146
01:32:20,296 --> 01:32:21,798
What?

1147
01:32:24,926 --> 01:32:27,637
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1148
01:32:27,804 --> 01:32:29,347
Tell him.

1149
01:32:31,015 --> 01:32:34,018
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1150
01:32:34,185 --> 01:32:37,897
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1151
01:32:38,606 --> 01:32:40,900
I heard something else
this morning too.

1152
01:32:41,067 --> 01:32:45,738
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe they forgot to ask him something.

1153
01:32:46,364 --> 01:32:49,117
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1154
01:32:49,284 --> 01:32:52,370
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1155
01:33:07,885 --> 01:33:11,639
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1156
01:33:11,806 --> 01:33:14,434
First child, Brendan Seamus,
born 1983."

1157
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:19,230
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1158
01:33:19,397 --> 01:33:21,733
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1159
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:26,070
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1160
01:33:26,237 --> 01:33:31,159
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1161
01:33:31,325 --> 01:33:33,578
...released on lack of evidence again.

1162
01:33:33,745 --> 01:33:37,123
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1163
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:40,835
"A known associate, one Edmund Reese,
fingers Raymond...

1164
01:33:41,002 --> 01:33:44,589
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection."

1165
01:33:44,756 --> 01:33:46,257
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1166
01:33:46,424 --> 01:33:49,093
Hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1167
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,012
Oh, excuse me.

1168
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:56,100
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed." Does a year solid inside.

1169
01:33:56,768 --> 01:33:59,270
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1170
01:33:59,437 --> 01:34:01,939
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1171
01:34:02,106 --> 01:34:03,983
Evidently not.

1172
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:08,488
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1173
01:34:08,654 --> 01:34:13,117
...trafficking stolen goods across
state lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1174
01:34:13,284 --> 01:34:16,120
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1175
01:34:16,287 --> 01:34:20,958
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1176
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:25,963
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1177
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:27,799
...he does no time.

1178
01:34:28,591 --> 01:34:32,011
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1179
01:34:32,178 --> 01:34:36,474
- August 1989, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1180
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:39,936
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1181
01:34:40,102 --> 01:34:43,689
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

1182
01:34:43,856 --> 01:34:48,486
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

1183
01:34:48,653 --> 01:34:52,490
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1184
01:34:53,157 --> 01:34:55,535
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1185
01:34:55,701 --> 01:34:58,329
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

1186
01:34:58,496 --> 01:35:03,334
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1187
01:35:04,001 --> 01:35:06,128
...Anthony Waxman."

1188
01:35:08,214 --> 01:35:10,049
And one James Markum.

1189
01:35:12,301 --> 01:35:14,679
And the hits just keep on coming.

1190
01:35:18,558 --> 01:35:22,019
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1191
01:35:22,186 --> 01:35:24,272
I already gotta get back.

1192
01:35:24,647 --> 01:35:27,858
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1193
01:35:28,025 --> 01:35:31,529
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1194
01:35:31,696 --> 01:35:36,200
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1195
01:35:36,409 --> 01:35:39,537
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1196
01:35:39,704 --> 01:35:43,165
- Think we pulled him over in New Bedford.
- But Harris walked.

1197
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:45,668
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1198
01:35:45,835 --> 01:35:50,047
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1199
01:35:50,214 --> 01:35:51,799
On who?

1200
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:54,593
What the fuck was the name?

1201
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,723
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1202
01:35:58,889 --> 01:36:00,683
Jimmy Markum.

1203
01:36:00,933 --> 01:36:05,855
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1204
01:36:06,147 --> 01:36:08,899
So did Harris ever testify
in open court?

1205
01:36:09,066 --> 01:36:12,653
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1206
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:16,574
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1207
01:36:16,741 --> 01:36:18,951
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1208
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:22,663
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1209
01:36:23,914 --> 01:36:26,459
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1210
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:29,587
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1211
01:36:29,754 --> 01:36:31,422
What's that tell you?

1212
01:36:42,767 --> 01:36:45,436
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1213
01:36:45,603 --> 01:36:48,439
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
- I'm good.

1214
01:36:48,606 --> 01:36:51,275
Okay. Hey.

1215
01:36:51,442 --> 01:36:53,986
- Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1216
01:36:54,153 --> 01:36:57,948
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1217
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:02,620
Step into my office.

1218
01:37:14,882 --> 01:37:16,258
Beautiful day, huh?

1219
01:37:24,391 --> 01:37:26,435
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1220
01:37:32,316 --> 01:37:34,777
I took Michael last night...

1221
01:37:35,319 --> 01:37:37,029
...and I went to a motel.

1222
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,491
Okay.

1223
01:37:41,575 --> 01:37:43,410
I don't know, Jim.

1224
01:37:44,829 --> 01:37:46,831
I might have left Dave for good.

1225
01:37:48,332 --> 01:37:50,209
You left Dave?

1226
01:37:53,462 --> 01:37:54,964
Yeah.

1227
01:37:56,173 --> 01:37:57,675
Well...

1228
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:02,555
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1229
01:38:05,224 --> 01:38:07,059
I'm almost afraid of him.

1230
01:38:11,313 --> 01:38:13,065
Do you know something?

1231
01:38:16,193 --> 01:38:19,196
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1232
01:38:19,863 --> 01:38:22,908
He saw Katie the night she was murdered.
Didn't tell me...

1233
01:38:23,075 --> 01:38:25,202
...till after the cops questioned him.

1234
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:29,540
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1235
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:32,710
Is there anything else I should know?

1236
01:38:40,551 --> 01:38:42,136
Come here.

1237
01:38:44,763 --> 01:38:46,265
Okay.

1238
01:38:47,349 --> 01:38:49,643
At 3 in the morning...

1239
01:38:49,935 --> 01:38:55,399
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

1240
01:38:59,236 --> 01:39:01,238
What did he say happened?

1241
01:39:02,865 --> 01:39:06,368
That he was mugged.
That he...

1242
01:39:06,535 --> 01:39:09,330
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1243
01:39:09,496 --> 01:39:10,748
That...

1244
01:39:10,914 --> 01:39:13,250
That he might have killed him.

1245
01:39:19,923 --> 01:39:22,968
But there was nothing in the paper.

1246
01:39:31,643 --> 01:39:34,605
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1247
01:39:37,483 --> 01:39:39,026
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1248
01:39:39,193 --> 01:39:40,694
Celeste?

1249
01:39:45,157 --> 01:39:47,576
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1250
01:39:52,623 --> 01:39:54,625
Okay. All right.

1251
01:39:54,792 --> 01:39:56,293
Okay.

1252
01:39:57,294 --> 01:39:59,129
Oh, God.

1253
01:40:05,344 --> 01:40:06,845
Okay.

1254
01:40:09,431 --> 01:40:11,475
Oh, my God.

1255
01:40:12,684 --> 01:40:15,687
- Tell me about your father, Brendan.
- What?

1256
01:40:15,854 --> 01:40:19,817
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1257
01:40:20,109 --> 01:40:23,862
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1258
01:40:24,947 --> 01:40:27,199
I remember little things.

1259
01:40:27,991 --> 01:40:30,702
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1260
01:40:31,328 --> 01:40:32,830
He...

1261
01:40:33,497 --> 01:40:35,040
He what?

1262
01:40:35,999 --> 01:40:40,504
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1263
01:40:41,004 --> 01:40:43,173
You could always hear him coming home.

1264
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:48,595
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1265
01:40:49,471 --> 01:40:51,849
You remember your father
having a gun?

1266
01:40:52,391 --> 01:40:53,851
No.

1267
01:40:54,017 --> 01:40:58,480
Well, you seem awfully sure for somebody
who was 6 when he left.

1268
01:40:59,231 --> 01:41:00,774
What's up?

1269
01:41:00,941 --> 01:41:03,777
- What's that?
- This is what you asked for.

1270
01:41:03,944 --> 01:41:08,532
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1271
01:41:08,699 --> 01:41:10,367
All right, thanks.

1272
01:41:11,076 --> 01:41:13,704
We were talking about your father's gun.

1273
01:41:14,663 --> 01:41:20,085
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1274
01:41:20,919 --> 01:41:23,839
- When was the last time you talked?
- Never.

1275
01:41:24,047 --> 01:41:25,340
Never?

1276
01:41:25,507 --> 01:41:27,801
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1277
01:41:27,968 --> 01:41:31,471
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1278
01:41:31,638 --> 01:41:33,348
Because he's not missing.

1279
01:41:33,515 --> 01:41:36,393
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1280
01:41:37,019 --> 01:41:40,981
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1281
01:41:42,232 --> 01:41:45,193
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1282
01:41:46,737 --> 01:41:49,406
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1283
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,244
Who else would send it?

1284
01:41:55,412 --> 01:41:57,497
My ma says that's the way he was.

1285
01:41:57,664 --> 01:42:00,584
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1286
01:42:04,254 --> 01:42:07,090
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1287
01:42:09,009 --> 01:42:10,469
You know why, kid.

1288
01:42:11,011 --> 01:42:12,304
No, I don't.

1289
01:42:13,263 --> 01:42:15,098
Gun that killed your girlfriend...

1290
01:42:15,265 --> 01:42:18,143
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1291
01:42:19,061 --> 01:42:20,312
So...

1292
01:42:20,937 --> 01:42:22,939
...you wanna tell me about it?

1293
01:42:25,942 --> 01:42:28,278
My father didn't have a gun.

1294
01:42:28,445 --> 01:42:30,447
You are fucking lying!

1295
01:42:36,787 --> 01:42:38,580
Can I go now?

1296
01:42:39,331 --> 01:42:42,125
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1297
01:42:55,305 --> 01:42:58,975
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1298
01:42:59,935 --> 01:43:01,686
Hey, Val.

1299
01:43:02,062 --> 01:43:04,356
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1300
01:43:05,065 --> 01:43:07,150
- All right.
- It's fucked up.

1301
01:43:09,569 --> 01:43:11,071
Katie.

1302
01:43:12,489 --> 01:43:14,324
A fucking tragedy.

1303
01:43:15,492 --> 01:43:16,743
Yeah.

1304
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:19,621
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1305
01:43:19,955 --> 01:43:21,206
Yeah?

1306
01:43:21,998 --> 01:43:24,251
Yeah. What do you say, man?

1307
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:28,213
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1308
01:43:30,841 --> 01:43:34,553
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1309
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:36,513
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

1310
01:43:37,681 --> 01:43:40,851
Well, the first round's on me.

1311
01:43:42,519 --> 01:43:44,563
Now you're talking.

1312
01:44:03,081 --> 01:44:07,794
- I think the kid is lying about the gun.
- Absolutely. I told you three times already.

1313
01:44:07,961 --> 01:44:12,966
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

1314
01:44:13,341 --> 01:44:14,718
Eighty grand. I mean...

1315
01:44:14,885 --> 01:44:18,555
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1316
01:44:19,598 --> 01:44:23,226
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1317
01:44:23,393 --> 01:44:26,855
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah.

1318
01:44:27,022 --> 01:44:29,357
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1319
01:44:29,524 --> 01:44:33,111
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

1320
01:44:37,407 --> 01:44:40,577
<i>911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

1321
01:44:40,744 --> 01:44:43,955
<i>There's, like, this car with blood in it,
and the door's open.</i>

1322
01:44:44,122 --> 01:44:47,083
<i>- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.</i>

1323
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:51,004
<i>It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.</i>

1324
01:44:51,171 --> 01:44:54,007
<i>- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.</i>

1325
01:44:54,174 --> 01:44:57,260
<i>- Your name, what's your name?
- We're so fucking out of here.</i>

1326
01:44:57,427 --> 01:44:59,304
<i>Good luck, man.</i>

1327
01:44:59,596 --> 01:45:03,600
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1328
01:45:03,767 --> 01:45:05,352
Her.

1329
01:45:06,102 --> 01:45:09,439
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

1330
01:45:13,735 --> 01:45:16,780
<i>- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.</i>

1331
01:45:16,946 --> 01:45:21,076
- He said, "Her name."
- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

1332
01:45:21,242 --> 01:45:23,828
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1333
01:45:23,995 --> 01:45:27,374
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1334
01:45:32,003 --> 01:45:33,338
Play it again.

1335
01:45:39,636 --> 01:45:43,139
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1336
01:45:43,306 --> 01:45:45,600
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
- Here.

1337
01:45:45,767 --> 01:45:50,271
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1338
01:45:50,438 --> 01:45:51,940
Fucking Carson.

1339
01:45:52,107 --> 01:45:56,236
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1340
01:45:56,403 --> 01:45:58,822
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1341
01:45:58,988 --> 01:46:04,702
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts screaming!

1342
01:46:06,788 --> 01:46:09,416
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1343
01:46:09,582 --> 01:46:11,584
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1344
01:46:11,751 --> 01:46:17,048
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1345
01:46:17,215 --> 01:46:18,967
Fucking smiley mask!

1346
01:46:21,428 --> 01:46:22,929
Idiot!

1347
01:46:23,096 --> 01:46:25,557
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1348
01:46:27,475 --> 01:46:31,813
Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1349
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:34,774
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1350
01:46:37,318 --> 01:46:39,362
Why do you think he went straight?

1351
01:46:42,073 --> 01:46:44,534
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1352
01:46:46,995 --> 01:46:48,830
What about you guys?

1353
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:53,835
What? Us? Going straight?

1354
01:46:55,253 --> 01:46:57,714
That's pretty fucking funny!

1355
01:47:01,467 --> 01:47:06,222
We're like bats, we like night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1356
01:47:06,389 --> 01:47:08,057
Want another shot?

1357
01:47:11,644 --> 01:47:16,900
- I should slow down till we eat.
- Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1358
01:47:17,066 --> 01:47:18,484
Come on, get up.

1359
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,742
Live a little, huh?

1360
01:47:53,102 --> 01:47:55,021
Slide over, Dave.

1361
01:47:56,522 --> 01:47:59,609
- Dave.
- All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1362
01:47:59,776 --> 01:48:03,237
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

1363
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:07,784
To our children.

1364
01:48:12,622 --> 01:48:14,582
- I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

1365
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,086
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1366
01:48:18,252 --> 01:48:21,297
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1367
01:48:21,464 --> 01:48:25,051
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1368
01:48:25,218 --> 01:48:27,804
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1369
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:30,556
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1370
01:48:30,723 --> 01:48:32,058
Yeah.

1371
01:48:32,225 --> 01:48:33,976
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

1372
01:48:39,857 --> 01:48:41,776
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1373
01:48:52,995 --> 01:48:55,790
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

1374
01:48:56,499 --> 01:48:58,167
Thanks, Kevin.

1375
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:37,415
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1376
01:49:37,582 --> 01:49:42,962
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles."

1377
01:49:45,381 --> 01:49:48,176
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

1378
01:49:48,342 --> 01:49:51,262
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1379
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:53,389
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1380
01:49:53,848 --> 01:49:56,726
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1381
01:49:56,893 --> 01:49:58,394
Come on. Come on, now.

1382
01:49:58,561 --> 01:50:03,566
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1383
01:50:26,672 --> 01:50:28,090
Hey, Ray.

1384
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:44,065
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1385
01:50:48,945 --> 01:50:50,780
Come here a second.

1386
01:50:56,285 --> 01:50:57,828
Sit down.

1387
01:51:07,213 --> 01:51:09,840
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1388
01:51:10,132 --> 01:51:13,928
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1389
01:51:14,595 --> 01:51:19,392
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1390
01:51:19,558 --> 01:51:22,144
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1391
01:51:22,311 --> 01:51:24,939
- That's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1392
01:51:25,106 --> 01:51:27,608
- I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1393
01:51:27,775 --> 01:51:29,026
...when she was dying.

1394
01:51:29,193 --> 01:51:33,447
The death part you do alone, but I
could have helped her with the dying.

1395
01:51:33,614 --> 01:51:35,658
Why are you telling me this?

1396
01:51:35,825 --> 01:51:40,037
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1397
01:51:40,204 --> 01:51:42,665
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1398
01:51:42,832 --> 01:51:44,375
He was begging.

1399
01:51:44,542 --> 01:51:47,294
You know, pregnant wife,
little Brendan.

1400
01:51:48,254 --> 01:51:51,924
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1401
01:51:52,675 --> 01:51:55,511
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1402
01:51:56,345 --> 01:51:57,763
Who do you hate?

1403
01:52:00,015 --> 01:52:01,600
Come on, who?

1404
01:52:01,767 --> 01:52:03,269
No one.

1405
01:52:05,563 --> 01:52:10,359
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1406
01:52:10,526 --> 01:52:14,029
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

1407
01:52:14,196 --> 01:52:16,574
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1408
01:52:17,032 --> 01:52:18,534
Who do you love?

1409
01:52:23,164 --> 01:52:24,832
You love me.

1410
01:52:27,001 --> 01:52:28,377
What about Ma?

1411
01:52:33,632 --> 01:52:37,219
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1412
01:52:40,222 --> 01:52:44,351
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1413
01:52:44,518 --> 01:52:47,229
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1414
01:52:47,688 --> 01:52:49,398
This is the mugger story.

1415
01:52:49,565 --> 01:52:54,111
He was a child molester.
He was having sex with a kid in his car.

1416
01:52:54,278 --> 01:52:58,073
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1417
01:53:06,248 --> 01:53:07,500
Get out of here.

1418
01:53:20,262 --> 01:53:21,680
Run!

1419
01:53:22,306 --> 01:53:23,933
<i>Dave, run!</i>

1420
01:53:26,101 --> 01:53:29,813
- You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1421
01:53:30,648 --> 01:53:33,609
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1422
01:53:33,776 --> 01:53:38,405
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1423
01:53:38,572 --> 01:53:42,952
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1424
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:47,706
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1425
01:53:47,873 --> 01:53:51,377
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1426
01:53:51,543 --> 01:53:55,965
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1427
01:53:56,131 --> 01:53:58,342
I didn't kill Katie.

1428
01:53:59,134 --> 01:54:03,263
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

1429
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:07,726
- I put him in the trunk of my car.
- Letting this piece of shit explain himself?

1430
01:54:07,893 --> 01:54:10,896
- Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
- I didn't kill her!

1431
01:54:11,063 --> 01:54:15,067
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

1432
01:54:15,234 --> 01:54:18,821
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

1433
01:54:18,988 --> 01:54:20,322
- Fuck!
- Shut up!

1434
01:54:24,576 --> 01:54:25,869
Nineteen years old.

1435
01:54:26,036 --> 01:54:28,497
- I didn't kill Katie!
- Nineteen years old!

1436
01:54:28,664 --> 01:54:31,834
- Look at me, Jimmy!
- I'm looking at you, Dave.

1437
01:54:32,001 --> 01:54:33,419
I'm looking at you.

1438
01:54:33,585 --> 01:54:36,296
Why'd you do it?

1439
01:54:36,463 --> 01:54:41,677
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

1440
01:54:41,844 --> 01:54:44,513
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1441
01:54:44,888 --> 01:54:47,641
No more lies, no more secrets.

1442
01:54:47,808 --> 01:54:50,477
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1443
01:54:51,353 --> 01:54:55,566
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

1444
01:54:56,525 --> 01:54:59,737
- The boy...
- One more time about the boy...

1445
01:54:59,903 --> 01:55:01,864
...and I will open you the fuck up.

1446
01:55:07,745 --> 01:55:10,581
I thought I was finished with all this.

1447
01:55:10,956 --> 01:55:14,418
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

1448
01:55:19,715 --> 01:55:23,260
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

1449
01:55:23,677 --> 01:55:27,723
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1450
01:55:28,348 --> 01:55:32,019
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

1451
01:55:32,186 --> 01:55:34,104
Admit what you did, Dave.

1452
01:55:34,271 --> 01:55:36,565
Admit what you did.

1453
01:55:38,233 --> 01:55:41,195
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

1454
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:43,614
I know you can speak.

1455
01:55:46,742 --> 01:55:50,370
So say it. Say you love me.

1456
01:55:53,749 --> 01:55:57,419
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

1457
01:56:05,302 --> 01:56:09,097
- He never does anything without you!
- No, let me go! Stop!

1458
01:56:16,438 --> 01:56:18,065
I'm coming back!

1459
01:56:24,071 --> 01:56:27,449
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

1460
01:56:27,616 --> 01:56:32,412
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

1461
01:56:32,621 --> 01:56:34,915
Say her name. Say it.

1462
01:56:35,374 --> 01:56:40,212
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

1463
01:56:50,806 --> 01:56:55,310
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

1464
01:56:55,978 --> 01:56:57,646
That's a Sig, right?

1465
01:56:59,982 --> 01:57:02,192
Don't you want to draw it on me?

1466
01:57:03,151 --> 01:57:05,654
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

1467
01:57:05,946 --> 01:57:08,991
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

1468
01:57:09,825 --> 01:57:12,828
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

1469
01:57:13,662 --> 01:57:16,623
- He broke my nose.
- We'll arrest him.

1470
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:20,460
- Haul his ass to jail if you like.
- I don't want him arrested.

1471
01:57:21,169 --> 01:57:22,879
I want him fucking dead!

1472
01:57:30,262 --> 01:57:32,472
Motherfucker.

1473
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,559
Motherfucker.

1474
01:57:37,853 --> 01:57:40,772
Admit what you did, Dave...

1475
01:57:41,857 --> 01:57:43,859
...and I'll let you live.

1476
01:57:44,026 --> 01:57:48,238
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1477
01:57:48,613 --> 01:57:50,782
You'll go to prison...

1478
01:57:51,867 --> 01:57:55,245
...but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

1479
01:57:55,412 --> 01:57:58,540
Admit what you did. Admit it.

1480
01:58:03,462 --> 01:58:05,213
Yeah.

1481
01:58:07,382 --> 01:58:09,259
Yeah, I did it.

1482
01:58:12,721 --> 01:58:14,389
Why?

1483
01:58:14,556 --> 01:58:16,016
Why?

1484
01:58:19,186 --> 01:58:23,482
That night in McGill's...

1485
01:58:24,441 --> 01:58:29,070
...she reminded me of a dream I had.

1486
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,698
What dream?

1487
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:35,660
A dream of youth.

1488
01:58:37,996 --> 01:58:40,582
I don't remember having one.

1489
01:58:43,043 --> 01:58:45,045
So it was the dream?

1490
01:58:46,713 --> 01:58:49,132
The dream, yeah.

1491
01:58:50,342 --> 01:58:55,722
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

1492
01:59:02,312 --> 01:59:05,273
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

1493
01:59:06,566 --> 01:59:09,486
Hang on. Come here. You did.

1494
01:59:30,924 --> 01:59:33,301
We bury our sins here, Dave.

1495
01:59:36,263 --> 01:59:38,640
We wash them clean.

1496
01:59:40,892 --> 01:59:45,146
- Look, his fucking lips are still moving.
- I got eyes, Val.

1497
01:59:51,611 --> 01:59:53,655
I wasn't ready.

1498
01:59:59,661 --> 02:00:00,996
It's like I said, Dave.

1499
02:00:04,291 --> 02:00:06,001
This part, you do alone.

1500
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,797
Tough night?

1501
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:57,552
Yeah, me too.

1502
02:00:59,554 --> 02:01:02,474
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

1503
02:01:11,191 --> 02:01:12,942
We got them, Jim.

1504
02:01:16,696 --> 02:01:18,073
Got who?

1505
02:01:18,615 --> 02:01:20,784
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

1506
02:01:25,371 --> 02:01:28,208
Killers, plural.

1507
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:34,339
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr. and another kid, John O'Shea.

1508
02:01:34,506 --> 02:01:36,925
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

1509
02:01:41,596 --> 02:01:42,972
No doubt?

1510
02:01:43,723 --> 02:01:45,433
None.

1511
02:01:54,734 --> 02:01:56,236
Why?

1512
02:01:57,779 --> 02:01:59,531
They don't know.

1513
02:01:59,697 --> 02:02:02,242
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

1514
02:02:02,408 --> 02:02:07,497
...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

1515
02:02:09,290 --> 02:02:13,169
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1516
02:02:13,336 --> 02:02:16,756
But she hit him with her door, ran...

1517
02:02:16,923 --> 02:02:20,844
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1518
02:02:28,768 --> 02:02:30,645
And the beating they gave her?

1519
02:02:33,147 --> 02:02:34,816
Ray Jr. had a hockey stick.

1520
02:02:37,986 --> 02:02:40,238
All right. Go easy.

1521
02:02:40,405 --> 02:02:42,323
Take a breath.

1522
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:45,535
Look at me.

1523
02:02:45,827 --> 02:02:47,745
Look at me, Jimmy.

1524
02:02:50,081 --> 02:02:52,417
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

1525
02:02:52,584 --> 02:02:56,921
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

1526
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:00,133
We need to talk to him.

1527
02:03:00,508 --> 02:03:04,971
Boston P.D. found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

1528
02:03:05,138 --> 02:03:07,557
A body? The body of a guy?

1529
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:11,352
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

1530
02:03:11,603 --> 02:03:14,439
They want to talk to Dave about it.

1531
02:03:14,981 --> 02:03:17,025
So, Jimmy...

1532
02:03:17,984 --> 02:03:20,570
...when was the last time
you saw Dave?

1533
02:03:31,289 --> 02:03:34,500
The last time I saw Dave.

1534
02:03:36,044 --> 02:03:39,255
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

1535
02:03:47,555 --> 02:03:51,893
- Dave Boyle.
- Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

1536
02:03:54,562 --> 02:03:59,359
That was 25 years ago, going up
this street in the back of that car.

1537
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:12,580
Jimmy, what did you do?

1538
02:04:20,713 --> 02:04:23,674
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

1539
02:04:27,428 --> 02:04:29,931
If only you'd been a little faster.

1540
02:04:38,189 --> 02:04:41,901
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

1541
02:04:48,491 --> 02:04:51,119
Sometimes I think...

1542
02:04:52,078 --> 02:04:55,039
I think all three of us got in that car.

1543
02:04:55,873 --> 02:05:00,127
And all of this is just a dream,
you know?

1544
02:05:00,294 --> 02:05:02,463
A dream, sure.

1545
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:06,133
In reality...

1546
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:11,013
...we're still 11-year-old boys
locked in a cellar...

1547
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:14,767
...imagining what our lives
would have been if we'd escaped.

1548
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:24,986
Maybe you're right.

1549
02:05:25,152 --> 02:05:27,488
Who the fuck knows?

1550
02:05:55,850 --> 02:05:58,019
Yeah, this is Sean.

1551
02:06:03,941 --> 02:06:07,028
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

1552
02:06:07,194 --> 02:06:09,488
I pushed you away.

1553
02:06:12,241 --> 02:06:14,660
I'm sorry too.

1554
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:18,414
Things have been so messed up.

1555
02:06:18,581 --> 02:06:21,167
Loving you, hating you.

1556
02:06:23,377 --> 02:06:25,046
Come home?

1557
02:06:27,798 --> 02:06:29,759
You change the locks or anything?

1558
02:06:30,885 --> 02:06:32,637
No.

1559
02:06:33,596 --> 02:06:36,724
No, everything is just
the way you left it.

1560
02:06:37,892 --> 02:06:40,686
<i>- Nora.
- What's that?</i>

1561
02:06:41,937 --> 02:06:45,608
Nora. That's our daughter's name,
Sean.

1562
02:06:46,734 --> 02:06:48,486
Nora, huh?

1563
02:06:48,652 --> 02:06:52,656
Well, I like that. Nora.

1564
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,814
I killed Dave.

1565
02:07:25,606 --> 02:07:28,734
I killed him, and I threw him
in the Mystic.

1566
02:07:29,777 --> 02:07:31,654
But I killed the wrong man.

1567
02:07:32,321 --> 02:07:34,615
That's what I've done.

1568
02:07:35,282 --> 02:07:37,660
And I can't undo it.

1569
02:07:38,661 --> 02:07:40,496
Jimmy.

1570
02:07:48,337 --> 02:07:51,173
I wanna feel your heart.

1571
02:07:51,966 --> 02:07:53,300
Last night...

1572
02:07:53,717 --> 02:07:57,888
...when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

1573
02:07:58,055 --> 02:08:01,142
- I told them how much you loved Katie...
- Annabeth.

1574
02:08:01,308 --> 02:08:02,977
...because you created her.

1575
02:08:03,144 --> 02:08:07,064
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

1576
02:08:07,231 --> 02:08:11,026
...it felt like your heart would explode...
- Please stop.

1577
02:08:11,193 --> 02:08:15,030
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1578
02:08:15,197 --> 02:08:18,701
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

1579
02:08:18,868 --> 02:08:22,830
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1580
02:08:22,997 --> 02:08:29,044
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1581
02:08:29,211 --> 02:08:32,423
And that is never wrong.

1582
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:38,512
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1583
02:08:38,679 --> 02:08:43,392
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1584
02:08:51,901 --> 02:08:56,405
You said, "Last night." You knew?

1585
02:08:57,489 --> 02:08:59,700
Celeste called, looking for you.

1586
02:08:59,867 --> 02:09:03,203
She was worried something might
happen. She told me about Dave.

1587
02:09:03,370 --> 02:09:06,206
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

1588
02:09:06,373 --> 02:09:09,543
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1589
02:09:09,710 --> 02:09:13,881
- Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

1590
02:09:14,298 --> 02:09:16,550
Their daddy's a king.

1591
02:09:16,717 --> 02:09:20,971
And a king knows what to do
and does it.

1592
02:09:21,138 --> 02:09:22,723
Even when it's hard.

1593
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:27,269
And their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves.

1594
02:09:27,436 --> 02:09:30,230
And that's all that matters.

1595
02:09:35,110 --> 02:09:38,781
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1596
02:09:38,947 --> 02:09:41,241
Everyone but us.

1597
02:09:41,408 --> 02:09:43,577
We will never be weak.

1598
02:09:43,744 --> 02:09:45,913
And you...

1599
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:49,500
You could rule this town.

1600
02:09:53,295 --> 02:09:55,923
And after, Jimmy...

1601
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:58,842
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

1602
02:09:59,009 --> 02:10:01,762
Katie would have liked that.

1603
02:11:38,775 --> 02:11:40,694
Michael!

1604
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:45,574
Michael! Michael!

1605
02:11:46,867 --> 02:11:48,869
Michael!

1606
02:11:49,453 --> 02:11:51,371
Michael!

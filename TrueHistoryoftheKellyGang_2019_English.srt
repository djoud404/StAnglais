be grateful, though.

to only four months.

- Dan, that's enough!
- You fucking lied to us!

Get off me! I don't want to go
to fucking jail!

There'll come a time, Mary,

1221
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,000
when you'll ask yourself,
"Am I a good mother?"

1222
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:06,739
And the only true answer
you'll have

1223
01:26:06,839 --> 01:26:09,839
will lie in the lengths your
children go to care for you.

1224

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,522
Take care
on di road, Nesta.

2
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,885
Is it true
your family has been threatened?

3
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,655
Jamaica is
on the brink of civil war.

4
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:36,156
They say
Edward Seaga is affiliated
with the CIA.

5
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,726
Do you think this will
impact the election?

6
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,096
Jamaica's been
in turmoil for 14 years.

7
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,731
<i>Why get involved</i>
<i>in politics now?</i>

8
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,768
Mr. Marley, please,
tell us whose side are you on?

9
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,306
All right, settle down,
settle down.

10
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,276
Smile Jamaica
is a non-political event.

11
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,345
A free concert that Bob Marley
has planned

12
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,313
for all di people dem.

13
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,716
My goal is to unify di people

14
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,519
through the message
of His Imperial Majesty,

15
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,087
Emperor Haile Selassie I,

16
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,290
King of Kings, Lord of Lords,
Earth's rightful ruler.

17
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,325
Rastafari.

18
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,029
Do you really believe music
can end the violence

19
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,230
when the government
has been unable?

20
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,199
Well, every government

21
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,036
pon di face of dis earth
is illegal, man.

22
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,237
Not one of dem is legal.

23
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,008
That's why mi don't deal
wid no politics.

24
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,977
And, yeah, reggae music
come to feed a revolution

25
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:31,746
that no guns can stop.

26
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,649
You're not concerned you'll
be seen as choosing sides

27
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,584
when you have gang leaders
like Bucky Marshall

28
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,319
and Claudie Massop fomenting
violence on the streets

29
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,589
and both political parties
are involved?

30
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,292

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,007
I don't think is a coincidence
that you doin' this concert

and all of a sudden,

99
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,477

Everything here

122
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,739
I really don't think you should
go through with this concert.

Chris, listen.
There's no way we back down.

124

Oh, yeah? And what dem say?

130
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:39,754
Apparently I have been
associating with someone

131
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,256
who could destabilize
the country.

132
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,457
Who, me?

133
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,461

English bwoy are different,
yu know, man.

577
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:22,737
"No chains around my feet,
but I'm not free.

578
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,540
I know I am bound here
in captivity."

579
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:28,176
It's one of my favorite lyrics
from "Catch a Fire."

580
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,610
It's really good.

581
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:30,778

1221
01:15:29,497 --> 01:15:32,166
Bob, you need to see a doctor.

1222
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:41,942
Two sevens clash.

1223
01:15:42,943 --> 01:15:44,311
I'm sorry?

1224
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:47,381
Two sevens clash.

1225
01:15:48,482 --> 01:15:51,986
Marcus Garvey say on the day
the two sevens clash,

1226
01:15:52,119 --> 01:15:55,456
di ruled will rise up
'gainst di rulers.

1227
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:59,393
Seventh of July 1977.

1228
01:15:59,528 --> 01:16:00,761
Huh.

1229
01:16:02,196 --> 01:16:03,697
Mr. Marley,

1230
01:16:04,732 --> 01:16:06,934
did you understand
what I've said?

1231
01:16:08,537 --> 01:16:09,770
Uh-huh.

1232
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:14,008
You said it's cancer.

1233
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:17,845
Acral Lentiginous Melanoma.

1234
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:19,947
It's a skin cancer.

1235
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:30,091
Mi can't get skin cancer
from a man stepping on mi toe.

1236
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:35,396
Well, the injury to your foot
isn't the cause.

1237
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:39,233
But the fact that it won't heal
is the result of the illness.

1238
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:41,135
It's very rare.

1239
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:43,637
Do you know
if it runs in your family?

1240
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:47,208
No. My faada
was a white man.

1241
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:50,211

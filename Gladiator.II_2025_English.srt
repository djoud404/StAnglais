00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,291
Serving the Senate and the people of Rome

192
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,085
is honor enough for me.

193
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,253
You are too modest, Acacius.

194
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,132
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

195
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,053
The glory is yours, not mine.

196
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,556
I only ask for some respite from war

197
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,017
to spend time with my wife.

198
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,520
Your wife, yes. [sniffs]

199
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,313
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

200
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,606
[sword scraping]

201
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,942
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

202
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,902
There are victories yet still to come.

203
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,864
Persia.

204
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,242
India.

205
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,493
[chuckles]

206
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,997
Both... must be conquered.

207
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,917
Rome has so many subjects.

208
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,461
She must feed them.

209
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,965
They can eat war. [laughs]

210
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,971
Your triumphs will be celebrated

211
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,224
as a tribute to the greatness

212
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,309
of the Roman people.

213
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,778
- [men shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

214
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,791
[man] Go to hell!

215
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,919
[people jeering]

216
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,600
[piercing animal shrieks]

217
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,685
[men shouting]

218
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,397
[announcer] Macrinus of Thysdrus,

219
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,691
- master of gladiators!
- [horn playing fanfare]

220
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,152
[crowd roars]

221
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,404
[animal screeching nearby]

222
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,000
[animal snarling]

223
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,130
- [screeching continues]
- [loud thumping]

224
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,091
Stay close.

225
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,468
- [snarling, thumping continue]
- [chains rattling]

226
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,136
[door thudding]

227
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,560
[crowd roaring]

228
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,357
[shouting, jeering]

229
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,194
[announcer] Aediles
and the town councilors,

230
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,489
distinguished guests,

231
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,575
citizens 0f Antium...

232
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,661
[jeering continues]

233
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,540
...behold the fate

234
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,502
of the conquered enemies of Rome:

235
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,633
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

236
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,387
Jugurtha!

237
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,222
[loud thudding]

238
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,015
- [snarling]
- [teeth snapping]

239
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,496
[man shouting, indistinct]

240
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,084
- [blows]
- [baboon shrieks]

241
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,922
[screeches]

242
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,302
[yells]

243
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,811
- [screeches]
- [Hanno yells]

244
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,028
[growling]

245
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,033
[guttural hooting]

246
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,633
[screeching in agony]

247
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,968
This one is interesting.

248
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,303
[all cheering]

249
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,805
[grunts]

250
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,141
[spits]

251
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,230
[yelling]

252
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,285
[baboon choking]

253
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,205
I'll buy him.

254
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,499
[crowd chanting]

255
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,354
- [horse approaching]
- Halt! Who goes there?

256
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,148
General.

257
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,381
[woman murmuring softly]

258
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,227
My lady.

259
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,863
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

260
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,991
Thank the Army. They protected me.

261
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,910
Mm.

262
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,621
Let me feed you.

263
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,465
[indistinct chatter]

264
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,551
- [men grunting]
- [weapons clashing]

265
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,359
[trainer] Go.

266
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,444
To the wall.

267
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,123
[trainer] The arena is a sacred temple.

268
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,376
For the bravest of you,

269
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,669
the road to glory runs through the arena.

270
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,383
The arena turns slaves into gladiators
and gladiators into free men.

271
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,225
You have worms.

272
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,607
I know this one. He eats monkeys.

273
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,984
[men laughing]

274
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,864
[indistinct chatter]

275
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,040
[trainer] Go. Sit. Eat.

276
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,557
[groans softly]

277
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,110
[man hoots quietly]

278
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,822
[men hooting]

279
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,868
[men mimicking baboons]

280
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,000
[hooting continues, louder]

281
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,967
[chuckles]

282
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,727
You.

283
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,688
[trainer] Hanno, get up.

284
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,574
What is your native language?
I speak them all.

285
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,372
You don't answer
because you can't or because you won't?

286
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,751
Mm, all right.

287
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,671
Violence... is the universal language.

288
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,424
Viggo, put him through his paces.

289
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,345
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

290
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,981
[grunts]

291
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,609
[Hanno groans]

292
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,577
[Hanno exhales heavily]

293
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,586
[both grunting]

294
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,811
[groans heavily]

295
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,646
[chuckling]

296
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,411
[explosive grunt]

297
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,332
[Macrinus] Enough!

298
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,336
[panting]

299
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,046
Very good.

300
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,924
Very good.

301
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,344
Hose him down.

302
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,558
Bring him to me.

303
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,313
[grunts]

304
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,858
Ah!

305
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,529
A strong jaw.

306
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,824
Good arms.

307
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,284
[sniffs]

308
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,660
Better smell.

309
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,662
[chuckles lightly]

310
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,206
You will do well.

311
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,250
It is an art,

312
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,794
choosing gladiators.

313
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,922
Some choose entertainers.

314
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,717
Some choose brute force.

315
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,260
I choose rage.

316
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,554
[Macrinus chuckles]

317
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,766
Crowd loves blood.

318
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,143
And they love those who love blood
as much as they do.

319
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,604
And you, my friend, rage

320
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,565
pours out of you like...

321
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,568
like milk...

322
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,529
from a whore's tit.

323
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,324
You will be quite the fighter.

324
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,408
Not for you.

325
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,119
You're right, you do not fight for me.

326
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,580
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

327
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,831
The choice is yours.

328
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,125
But whose head could I give you

329
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,588
that would satisfy this fury?

330
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,590
The entire Roman Army's.

331
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,676
[hearty laugh]

332
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,220
Too much.

333
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,930
Mm.

334
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,099
The general will do.

335
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,058
General?

336
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,436
- General Acacius?
- Mm.

337
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,358
Use your rage in my service,

338
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,237
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

339
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,533
Serve me and I will serve you. Deny me...

340
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,495
and you will die.

341
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,372
[thunder rumbles in distance]

342
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,250
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

343
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,085
rather than fight their wars.

344
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,129
I've made my choice.

345
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,049
I can live with it.

346
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,098
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

347
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,227
Leta?

348
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,690
You may go to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

349
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,532
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

350
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,284
on that beach at Numidia...

351
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,455
Lucilia.

352
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,044
No more.

353
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,840
I will not waste

354
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,178
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

355
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,933
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

356
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,937
When will your troops arrive?

357
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,149
They land at Ostia in ten days.

358
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,444
How many of them
will be loyal to you alone?

359
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,198
All of them.

360
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,161
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

361
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:13,458
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

362
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,461
[sighs]

363
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:20,840
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

364
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,551
[chuckles softly]

365
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,765
[whimpers]

366
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,770
[excited chatter]

367
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,653
[laughing]

368
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,156
[man] Enjoy yourself, everyone,

369
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,325
to excess!

370
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,953
Thank you. Thank you.

371
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,998
[castrato singing to lively music]

372
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,133
Oh!

373
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,971
[laughs] Please, drink.

374
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,890
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

375
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,894
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

376
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:18,147
- I'm just here for the games.
- Ah, well,

377
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,858
you won't be disappointed.

378
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,152
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

379
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,488
Men like me, Thraex? Men like us.

380
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:29,409
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've tasted it first.

381
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,785
[both laughing]

382
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,218
What is my purpose here?

383
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,678
You'll find out soon enough.

384
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,518
What's this we hear
about you being interested

385
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:59,355
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

386
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,941
Me? No, I'm, uh...

387
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,694
I don't even know how to use an abacus.

388
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,279
But I do understand that

389
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,618
it's customary for your guests
to make wagers at these affairs?

390
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,870
How large a sum did you have in mind?

391
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,040
A thousand gold denarii?

392
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,374
Two.

393
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,544
Two?

394
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,757
- Denarii.
- [chuckles]

395
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,053
[sighs deeply]

396
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,096
[knife scraping]

397
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,400
Stand back! Stand back!

398
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,570
My emperors.

399
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,741
Lords, ladies and gentlemen, and senators.

400
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,077
For your entertainment,

401
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,163
the art of combat!

402
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,207
[crowd murmurs, clapping]

403
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,000
[Thraex] May I present

404
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,920
the barbarian versus,

405
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,423
from my own stable, the mighty Vichek!

406
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,467
[applause, cheers]

407
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,183
- This is your gladiator?
- It is.

408
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,272
[Thraex] Three rounds, hand to hand.

409
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,524
Swords!

410
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,277
We want swords. Afight to the death.

411
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,657
No quarter to be offered... or given.

412
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,784
- Fight now!
- [swords scraping]

413
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,374
Brother,

414
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,335
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

415
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,795
[Vichek yells, grunts]

416
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,339
[excited murmuring]

417
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,133
[both yell, grunt]

418
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,852
[cackling]

419
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,354
[both yelling]

420
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,077
[Vichek panting]

421
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,789
[yells]

422
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,045
[sword clattering]

423
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,964
[scattered cheers, applause]

424
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,096
[Hanno groans]

425
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,398
[scattered cheers]

426
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,108
[applause]

427
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,153
[Geta] Remarkable!

428
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,614
[giggling]

429
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,199
Remarkable!

430
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,410
- Thraex, he looked expensive.
- [dry chuckle]

431
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,955
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

432
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,291
Remarkable.

433
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,380
From where do you hail?

434
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,387
Speak.

435
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,103
- I said speak.
- He is from the colonies, Your Majesty.

436
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,480
His native tongue is all he understands.

437
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,989
"The gates of hell are open night and day.

438
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:43,579
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

439
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,668
[laughing] But...

440
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,255
to come back from hell

441
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,841
and view the cheerful skies,

442
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:59,428
in this the task and mighty labor lies."

443
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,099
[panting]

444
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,311
Virgil, Your Majesty.

445
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,480
[Caracalla] Poetry!

446
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,524
[laughter]

447
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,444
- Very clever, Macrinus.
- Thank you.

448
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,115
I've grown so bored, but you surprise me.

449
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,243
To amuse you is my only wish.

450
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,078
We are amused, we are amused.

451
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,415
We are amused.

452
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,711
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

453
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,422
perform in the arena.

454
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,383
As do I, Your Majesties.

455
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,218
Thank you.

456
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:40,720
Viggo?

457
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,514
[Viggo] Come with me.

458
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,118
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

459
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,414
The lines you recited.

460
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,626
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

461
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,795
- A good verse travels far.
- Mm.

462
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,839
Who taught you poetry?

463
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,091
A captured Roman officer.

464
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,762
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

465
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,347
to pass the time.

466
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,599
And what became of this prisoner?

467
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,100
Oh, we ate him.

468
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,561
As barbarians do.

469
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,022
[chuckling] As barbarians do.

470
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,315
And where were you born?

471
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:39,695
Why does my past matter if it is my future
to die for you in the arena?

472
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,579
Tell me what use have I for Roman money.

473
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,376
A gladiator

474
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,046
- can buy his own freedom.
- Mmm.

475
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,923
- His liberty.
- [chuckles]

476
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,634
The Roman dream.

477
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:05,930
No, the slave dreams not of freedom
but of a slave to call his own.

478
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,557
Cicero.

479
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,144
Is that what you were raised on, Macrinus?

480
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,399
What did you have to do for Roman money?

481
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,277
You promised me a head.

482
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,154
Earn your keep
and you can have anyone's head.

483
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,748
[stone scraping]

484
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,500
[door unlatches, Opens]

485
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,009
[thunder rumbling]

486
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,638
[Lucilia] Father,

487
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,766
protect us and guide us.

488
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,032
Senators.

489
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,867
My lady.

490
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,460
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

491
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,296
Better times will come.

492
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,008
And why are we here?

493
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,926
[Acacius] To take back the city.

494
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,349
And restore Rome to where she should be.

495
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,685
An exciting venture.

496
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,356
- When?
- On the final day of the games.

497
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,359
My army waits for my command at Ostia.

498
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,904
Five thousand soldiers loyal to me...

499
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,949
will enter Rome and then the Colosseum,

500
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,495
where they will arrest the emperors
for their crimes against the Senate

501
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,914
and their people.

502
00:47:55,915 --> 00:48:00,211
Uh, this plan is ambitious and risky.

503
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,756
Rome will be yours to administer and to--

504
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,511
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power to the Senate,

505
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:12,056
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

506
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,976
The people have not seen hope

507
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,396
for many years.

508
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:22,149
But with time... and guidance...

509
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:27,196
[sighs sharply] Lucilia,
you are the daughter of Marcus Aurelius.

510
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,281
He had my loyalty.

511
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,993
And so do you.

512
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,747
Senator Thraex?

513
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,877
Politics follows power, my lady.

514
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,048
Take back what is rightfully yours...

515
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,093
and the Senate will support you.

516
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,387
Thank you.

517
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,904
Food! Food!

518
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,202
When I was told of this place,

519
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,205
they never mentioned the stink.

520
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,417
That would be Hanno.

521
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,670
[laughter]

522
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,590
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

523
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,049
[laughing]

524
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,806
And what's that up there? A wolf?

525
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,019
The twins there, they were outcasts.

526
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,605
Left in the hills to die.

527
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,693
That wolf found them
and she suckled them on her milk.

528
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,363
Raised by an animal. It's in their blood.

529
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,449
How do you know this place?

530
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,453
I know the chaos they brought.

531
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,499
This city infects everything it touches.

532
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,667
I never dreamt it would be so big.

533
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,503
Don't fall for it.

534
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,546
This city is diseased.

535
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,008
[peasants] Food! Food!

536
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,930
[children chattering]

537
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,309
[elephant trumpeting]

538
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,394
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

539
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,201
[man] You! Barbarian scum!

540
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,788
- [grunts]
- [people yelling]

541
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,125
[woman] Help me. Please, help me!

542
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,296
[all pleading]

543
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,385
[horses whinnying]

544
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,311
[crows squawking]

545
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,163
- Ah!
- Thraex.

546
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,085
About our wager.

547
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,920
Ah. The barbarian.

548
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,922
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

549
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,342
I was merely going to suggest
that perhaps your luck might change.

550
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,761
Shall we say double or quits?

551
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,517
- Ah.
- Ah.

552
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,519
[both laughing]

553
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,484
[people shouting, indistinct]

554
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,156
[man] Get back!

555
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,963
Fresh meat.

556
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,886
Line up! Line up!

557
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,110
[faint crowd cheering]

558
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,907
[cheering continues, louder]

559
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,086
Play! Play!

560
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,131
[playing simple fanfare]

561
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,603
Emperor Caracalla.

562
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,772
Emperor Geta.

563
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:15,192
Citizens of Rome!

564
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,860
[crowd cheering]

565
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,988
These sacred games

566
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:23,325
are held to honor the victory of Rome

567
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,495
over the barbarians of Numidia.

568
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,705
[crowd booing]

569
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,290
Go! Go!

570
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,714
[announcer] And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

571
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,007
General Justus Acacius!

572
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,760
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Long live Acacius!

573
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,220
[announcer] And with him

574
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:48,100
Lucilia, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

575
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,810
[crowd cheering]

576
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,355
- [woman, faintly] Lucilia!
- [man] Mother of Rome!

577
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,649
Acacius.

578
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,359
General.

579
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,992
[crowd roars]

580
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,412
[chanting] Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

581
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:13,500
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

582
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,544
Speak to them.

583
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,671
[man faintly] Speak to us!

584
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:26,221
[cheering ebbs]

585
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,973
I am not an Orator

586
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,684
or a politician.

587
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,604
I am a soldier.

588
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:40,819
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

589
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,822
And even Once in this arena.

590
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,075
So if you ask anything of the gods...

591
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,371
ask for that same bravery.

592
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,793
Because Rome needs it now.

593
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,879
[applause, cheers swelling]

594
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,800
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

595
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:06,053
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

596
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,098
[chanting continues]

597
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,235
[announcer] From the South Gate,

598
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:26,323
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

599
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,921
From the stables

600
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,591
of Emperors Caracalla and Geta themselves,

601
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,261
the undefeated champion:

602
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,014
Glyceo the Destroyer!

603
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,850
[crowd roars]

604
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,564
Hold.

605
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,482

606
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,905

[rhino roaring]

609
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,213
[Hanno] Hold.

610
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,133
Hail Caesars!

611
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:31,221
[crowd chanting] Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

612
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,265

[rhino roars]

614
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:46,069
Hold together and when it charges,
break for the wall.

615
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:46,987
[man] Why should I?

616
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,117
[Hanno] Hold!

617
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,453
Hold!

618
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,746
Break!

619
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,748
Cowards!

620
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,293
[yells]

621
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,921
[groaning]

622
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,342
- [yells]
- [axe clattering]

623
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,762
[huffing]

624
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,889
To the wall!

625
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,183
[grunts heavily]

626
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,478

628
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,195
- Come on!
- [roars]

[both grunting]

639
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:09,880
[roaring]

640
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,133
Brother, it's that poet, is it not?

641
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,969
I can't remember.

642
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,721
That night was a blur.

643
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,808
"The gates of hell are open night and day.

644
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,978
Smooth the desc--" I forget.

645
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,813
"Smooth the descent..."

646
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,649
"Smooth is the descent,

647
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,902
easy is the way."

648
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,660
Shield!

649
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,773
[yelling]

650
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,325
[crowd chanting] Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

651
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,370
Blood.

652
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,541
Lucilia,

653
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,584
shall we show mercy?

654
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,253
Mercy.

655
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,423
[chanting continues]

656
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,061
No mercy!

657
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,605
Your life has been spared by the gods--

658
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:54,693
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

659
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,033
[both grunting]

660
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,620

[rhino groaning]

669
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,721
The road to freedom
doesn't run through the arena.

670
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,057
It leads to this.

671
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,021
Go to your cells.

672
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,317
[all cheering, clapping]

673
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,904

[dog whimpers]

676
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,172
Come on, let's go.

677
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,647
"Gates of hell are open night and day.

01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,358
[voice wavering] Smooth is the descent...

[crying] ...easy is the way."

01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,866
[boy] <i>There, there, there, there.</i>

681
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,201
<i>And l've got you.</i>

682
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:10,954
<i>I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!</i>

683
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,559
Scatto and Argento.

684
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,480
[people cheer, echoing]

685
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,652
[gasping softly]

686
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,657
Lucius is safe?

687
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,551
[Lucilia] Lucius!

688
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,438
[horse whinnies]

689
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,315
[Lucilia] Lucius,

690
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,194
you're the sole heir to the throne now.

691
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,823
There are men who want to kill you
so they can take power.

692
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,787
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

693
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,456
Mother, why can't you come with me?

694
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,043
[crying] I... I have to stay here
for your sake.

695
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,128
[sniffles] And for the sake of Rome.

696
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,838
Remember who you are.

697
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,633
And that I love you.

698
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,718
I love you.

699
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,678
[man] Come.

700
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,308
Give me your leg.

701
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,937
Go. Go!

702
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,355
[horse whinnies]

703
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,070
[doctor] So...

704
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,697
[Hanno grunts]

705
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,825
What's your name?

706
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:14,577
[exhales]

707
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,247
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

708
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:22,001
Because... more men die of infected wounds

709
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,587
than out there, in the arena.

710
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,883
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and...

711
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,678
[exclaims softly] ...it is going to hurt.

712
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,887
Mm.

713
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:36,015
This is Devil's Breath and opium.

714
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,184
It's for the pain.

715
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,854
You should breathe in.

716
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,106
[inhales sharply, grunts]

717
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,150
[deep inhale]

718
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,403
[Ravi] I've been here so long now,

719
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,947
I don't even notice anymore.

720
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,741
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

721
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,579
- Where'd you learn your trade?
- Why do you ask?

722
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,289
You've got a heavy hand.

723
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,208
I used to be a gladiator myself.

724
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,460
Ah.

725
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,879
- And would you have bested me?
- [Ravi chuckles]

726
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,422
In your prime, of course.

727
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,342
In your current state,
I could best you now.

728
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,011
[laughs]

729
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:16,347
Luckily for you, I have put down my sword.

730
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,641
- So now I spend my days...
- [groaning]

731
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,311
...saving lives instead of taking them.

732
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,729
[inhales, grunts]

733
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,273
And why such a change so late in life?

734
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,401
What we do in life

735
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,320
echoes in eternity.

736
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,822
[panting softly]

737
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,242
I feel like I know those words.

738
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,870
[Ravi chuckles] I can't take credit.

739
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,539
It's written on one of the tombs.

740
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,458
Over the bones of a gladiator.

741
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,835
- [sharp grunt of pain]
- [Macrinus] My champion!

742
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,004
I smell Devil's Breath!

743
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,340
[laughing]

744
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,760
My... champion.

745
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,471
Did you hear that crowd?

746
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,684
- Did you hear that crowd?
- Mm-hm.

747
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,855
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

748
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,776
- Did you now?
- Yes. The Greeks call it...

749
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,153
<i>thymos.</i>

750
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,530
Smoke.

751
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,615
Rage.

752
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,660
That rage is your gift.

753
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,204
Like the great Achilles.

754
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,915
Never let it go.

755
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,585
It will carry you to greatness,

756
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,420
my champion.

757
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,682
[horses whinny, snort]

758
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,149
Thank you

759
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,235
for inviting me.

760
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,071
This is truly an honor.

761
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,120
I hear you are the talk of the court.

762
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,454
[kissing hand]

763
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,415
Yes.

764
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,750
We've met before.

765
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,503
- Have we?
- Long ago.

766
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,590
Where?

767
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:17,302
I was in the service of your father's army
on his African campaign.

768
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,930
You served with my father?

769
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,182
[groaning]

770
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:25,768
Mm.

771
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,521
I had the privilege

772
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,149
of reading his "Meditations."

773
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,442
Mm.

774
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,363
"The best revenge

775
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,743
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

776
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:46,623
I hear you've been arming half the legions

777
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:51,753
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

778
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:56,007
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

779
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,176
I do it for the love of the sport.

780
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,220
And where did you find these gladiators?

781
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,974
They're usually prisoners of war.

782
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,561
Or vagrants. Why do you ask?

783
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,231
A man can choose to fight...

784
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,151
and stay alive.

785
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,862
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

786
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:23,159
Who is this?

787
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,578
That is my father as a youth.

788
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,083
[Macrinus] <i>She had a child?</i>

789
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,918
Mm. [swallows]

790
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,420
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

791
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,297
- the boy disappeared.
- Mm.

792
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,466
- But who would care?
- Lucilia would care.

793
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,177
- More wine!
- More wine!

794
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:46,015
He was of the royal bloodline, after all.

795
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,102
And his father?

796
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:53,106
[senator] Ostensibly, Lucius Verus.

797
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,817
See, it was an arranged marriage.

798
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,984
She was 14.

799
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:00,446
- Mm.
- Females were not his taste.

800
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,906
- Nor mine, some days.
- Nor yours!

801
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,199
[both laugh]

802
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:07,787
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see, she took lovers.

803
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,999
And by rumor,
the real father... was Commodus.

804
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,461
- Brotherly love, you see?
- Yeah.

805
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,213
If he died,

806
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,675
- there has to be remains.
- Mm.

807
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:24,095
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

808
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,264
Um, well, let's work it out.

809
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:29,767
- He was about 12 when he died?
- Yes.

810
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:34,105
So that would make him...

811
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,985
[heavy door rumbling]

812
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,532
[squeaking]

813
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,958
[ho of beats thudding]

814
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:10,600
My lady.

815
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:12,101
Gracchus.

816
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,104
- Please come.
- Thank you.

817
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,291
Gladiator...

818
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:37,794
do you know me?

819
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,553
Do you have a family?

820
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:53,309
A wife. Arishat.

821
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,020
Arishat.

822
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:59,607
She was killed
under your husband's command.

823
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,529
[sighing] Rome drowns in its own blood.

824
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,906
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

825
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:11,077
There is much you do not understand.

826
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:18,918
Lucius.

827
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,212
I do not know who you think I am.

828
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,672
[Lucilia's breath trembles]

829
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,424
My name is Hanno,

830
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,927
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

831
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,598
[sniffles]

832
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,686
[crying] I'm so sorry.

833
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,896
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

834
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,898
not to grieve him.

835
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:42,733
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

836
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,777
That boy is dead.

837
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,282
You may think I have little worth.

838
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,952
You may think I betrayed you.

839
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,706
But I need you to know...

840
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,127
if you will not have your mother's love,

841
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,046
then take your father's strength.

842
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,632
You need it.

843
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:13,139
His name was Maximus Decimus Meridius.

844
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,058
And I see him in you.

845
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,476
Get out.

846
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,064
[Gracchus] My lady, we must go at once!

847
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,275
[Lucilia sobs]

848
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,194
Lucius, you were loved

849
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,489
by myself and by your father.

850
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:32,283
[sniffles]

851
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,910
Your name was on his lips--

852
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,745
Get out!

853
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,001
[panting]

854
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,920
[door shuts]

855
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,639
[Lucilia exhales]

856
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,689
Lucius is alive.

857
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,902
Are you certain?

858
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,236
Yes.

859
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,530
I know my son.

860
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,452
I spoke to him tonight.

861
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,917
He may be lost to me for what I did,

862
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,878
but he lives.

863
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,715
The third day of the games is tomorrow.

864
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,384
Most fighters won't survive.

865
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,802
Acacius,

866
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,680
you must help him.

867
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,391
- Help him?
- [crying] Yes.

868
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:43,396
I failed him then.

869
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,481
I know I did.

870
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,402
I cannot fail him now.

871
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,531
The army is in Ostia.

872
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,409
If we wait a few days...

873
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,494
He could be dead by then.

874
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,914
Acacius,

875
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:05,584
I would willingly give my life for Rome,

876
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:09,171
but I will not give my son's.

877
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:16,846
[Viggo] And one.

878
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,515
And two.

879
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,102
- And one.
- [all groaning with effort]

880
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,022
Together. Timing, timing, timing!

881
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,359
And one. And two.

882
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,069
And one.

883
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,989
Pause, pause!

884
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,160
We won't get far like this.

885
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,745
[all laughing]

886
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,247
Just him. You go.

887
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,331
Go!

888
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,586
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

889
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,839
Ready?

890
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,132
One!

891
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,009
And two!

892
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,136
Timing, timing!

893
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,221
Come on, more!

894
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,557
[grunts]

895
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,561
[Viggo] More!

896
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,863
[Lucius groans loudly]

897
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,743
[heavy grunt]

898
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,205
Leave him.

899
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,290
[indistinct chatter]

900
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,210
[huffs, grunts]

901
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:40,721
[cork pops]

902
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:47,186
[stammering] It's just vinegar, my friend.

903
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,270
[pained groan]

904
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,981
There will be no more opium for you.

905
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:56,028
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

906
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:59,448
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it in this one.

907
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,663
Are you a free man, Ravi?

908
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,540
[dry chuckle] "Free."

909
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,669
I am. Mm.

910
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,337
I laid down my sword

911
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,422
and I swore never to pick it up again.

912
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,091
And yet you choose this hell?

913
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,801
Mm-hm.

914
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,177
What was your home before?

915
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,888
Varanasi.

916
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,390
And why don't you go back?

917
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:26,809
I wish I could.

918
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,561
- [breath hissing]
- But... Eh-eh-eh.

919
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,190
- I met a woman. [laughs]
- Ah.

920
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,901
- It's always a woman.
- Always.

921
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:40,531
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

922
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,449
So now...

923
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:45,494
our sons, they speak only Latin.

924
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,997
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

925
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,456
[chuckles lightly]

926
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,001
We are Romans now.

927
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:56,005
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

928
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,050
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

929
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:06,765
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

930
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,853
or it would vanish.

931
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:12,771
[whispering] So,

932
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,982
what was this dream?

933
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:19,612
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

934
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,448
A Rome of the Senate.

935
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,618
A Rome of hope.

936
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:33,125
Your grandfather,
he sounds like a dangerous man.

937
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,376
Hm.

938
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,547
The odds are against you.

939
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:40,758
[light chuckle]

940
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,636
The odds are always against me.

941
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:45,846
Don't worry, old man.

942
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,765
- Eh?
- [both laughing]

943
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,642
[muttering]

944
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,354
- You should get some rest. Hm?
- Mm.

945
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,899
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

946
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,826
[gates rumbling open]

947
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,579
- [crowd cheering]
- [drums thudding]

948
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,959
This is about survival.

949
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,461
Survive!

950
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:21,340
[announcer] In the name of Poseidon,

951
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:25,594
we celebrate the glory of naval war.

952
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,429
[Lucius] They have archers.

953
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,974
Be ready. Listen for my commands.

954
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,810
Stay together and pull as one, yes?

955
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:33,769
[all] Yes!

956
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,146
- Yes?
- Yes!

957
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,651
[hull creaking]

958
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,781
[announcer]Today we relive

959
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:49,410
the Battle of Salamis!

960
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:50,536
[crowd cheering]

961
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:55,207
The Trojans versus the Persians!

962
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,338
- Oars out!
- [all] Oars!

963
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,258
And... pull!

964
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,926
[all grunting explosively]

965
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,904
- Archers!
- [men yelling]

966
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:26,864
Archers!

967
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,034
Pull!

968
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,711
Pull!

974
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:00,064
Pull! To my time!

975
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,107
And... now!

976
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,154
Left side! Ready, and

977
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,198
ship oars now!

978
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,325
Oars in! Oars in!

979
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,203
Get down!

980
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,081
[screams]

981
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,917

[men grunting rhythmically]

985
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,852

[men shout in unison]

989
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,318
And right!

990
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,450
Ready to ram!

991
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:55,577
[Romans shouting, indistinct]

992
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:58,205
And brace! Brace!

993
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,082
[all yelling]

994
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,589

[gasping]

998
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,580
[soldier] Everyone regroup!

999
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,586
[screaming]

1000
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,504
[fighting grunts]

1001
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:13,947
[grunts]

1002
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,824
[crowd exclaiming]

1003
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,868
Praetorians!

1004
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,747
[crowd chanting] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1005
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:22,789
Move, move.

1006
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:25,292
[chanting continues]

1007
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,883
[announcer] In the name of the emperors...

1008
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:37,513
the victor is Hanno!

1009
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:42,434
[all chanting in support]

1010
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,109
Who did this?

1011
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,073
Who did this?!

1012
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,408
- It was me!
- I did it!

1013
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,911
- [men] I did it! I did it! I did it!
- It was me!

1014
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:07,584
Geta will want retribution for all of you.

1015
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:11,505
Did you learn to shoot in the same place
you learned to recite poetry?

1016
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,216
Be glad it wasn't me,
or that arrow would have found you.

1017
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,343
[men laughing]

1018
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,138
[indistinct chatter]

1019
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:22,558
[faint music playing]

1020
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,441
Be seated.

1021
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:35,362
I have news for you.

1022
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,326
He's here, sir.

1023
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,413
[door opens]

1024
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,456
[Macrinus] Oh, still here.

1025
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,584
[Thraex laughs nervously]

1026
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,085
Macrinus.

1027
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,254
- [Macrinus chuckles]
- Welcome.

1028
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,048
Yes, I'm listening.

1029
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:57,884
You know this is my house now.

1030
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,514
Your debt to me is over 10,000 denarii.
You know that.

1031
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,434
[chuckles, stammers]
I have other things. Uh...

1032
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,311
Cattle. Art!

1033
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:09,021
Truth, then.

1034
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,689
What do you... want?

1035
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,774
Truth. That's what I want.

1036
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:17,988
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

1037
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,116
You have the senators' trust.

1038
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:24,202
You have Lucilia's trust.

1039
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,955
More importantly, you have my trust.

1040
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:33,003
You wish my... loyalty?

1041
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,713
I own...

1042
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,050
your house.

1043
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,344
I want your loyalty.

1044
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,891
I...

1045
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,935
Tell me. I have heard...

1046
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:51,647
of a plot...

1047
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,566
- to dethrone the emperors.
- Yes.

1048
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,819
But the plan has been delayed, uh...

1049
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,073
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

1050
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,574
- Tonight.
- Mm.

1051
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,744
- I don't know why.
- I know why. I know who.

1052
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,206
Pack.

1053
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,378
Quickly.

1054
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,490
- [pounding on gate]
- [man] Open up!

1055
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:45,617
[rats squeaking]

1056
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,257
[mastiffs growling]

1057
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,595
[man] Open for the emperors' guard!

1058
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,222
[pounding on door]

1059
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,413
[heavy knocking]

1060
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,501
My Lady, come with us.

1061
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:48,972
[all grunting with impact]

1062
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:26,802
Thanks to the civic virtue
of men like Thraex and Macrinus,

1063
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,805
your insurrection

1064
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,474
has been revealed.

1065
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:35,685
The honor,

1066
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:40,607
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

1067
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,403
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

1068
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,614
Please, Emperor Geta.

1069
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:50,784
Torture me if you want,

1070
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,119
but do not lecture me.

1071
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:56,623
Your name will be forgotten!

1072
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,752
Lost... to history.

1073
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,172
You are damned, General.

1074
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,966
[laughing]

1075
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:08,802
- [Geta] You laugh.
- You damn me?

1076
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,429
I don't care.

1077
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:15,308
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

1078
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:17,102
[Caracalla] Why wait?

1079
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:20,397
- I will gut him right now!
- No, no, no!

1080
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,108
Let them be. Come! Come!

1081
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,694
His death must be public.

1082
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,279
Public? [grunts]

1083
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,240
Hang his entrails from the city gates!

1084
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,867
And crucify her!

1085
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,119
Crucify her!

1086
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,121
Take them away!

1087
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,541
- [Caracalla yells]
- [Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

1088
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:53,847
Thank you, Macrinus.

1089
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,521
Come on.

1090
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,860
In these last days,

1091
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:10,196
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

1092
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,490
but as a true friend.

1093
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:14,242
Thank you.

1094
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:16,995
Thank you so much. But as a friend,

1095
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,914
I must counsel caution.

1096
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,917
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

1097
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:27,255
Crucifixion is for thieves.

1098
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,423
Christians.

1099
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:32,594
- It's too common.
- He is a traitor. He must die.

1100
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:33,929
I agree.

1101
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:39,851
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

1102
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,859
Let the gods decide.

1103
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:54,699
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

1104
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,244
This time, for the first time,

1105
01:30:58,328 --> 01:30:59,788
I was crossing it.

1106
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,290
[Ravi] Hm.

1107
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,876
Well, you know, where I come from,

1108
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,963
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

1109
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:11,049
Represents... salvation.

1110
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:14,135
Where I come from,
it means you're already dead.

1111
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,053
[chuckles]

1112
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,980
But as I saw it, I was not afraid.

1113
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,400
For...

1114
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:31,319
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

1115
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:34,698
There. [sniffs]

1116
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,501
Who is this man?

1117
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:49,295
Scratched out?

1118
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:52,257
Maximus.

1119
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,012
I saw him fight once.

1120
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,681
- He was magnificent.
- Mm.

1121
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,726
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

1122
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:07,105
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

1123
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,982
Spoke of him.

1124
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,484
What he did.

1125
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,862
I met him once.

1126
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,198
He was kind.

1127
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,369
He bowed to no one.

1128
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,541
Come with me.

1129
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:29,627
- Hmm?
- Come. With me.

1130
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:52,942
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

1131
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:57,405
"What we do in life echoes in eternity."

1132
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,008
This is Argento.

1133
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,593
This is Scatto.

1134
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,686
[cheering, applause]

1135
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,317
[drums thudding]

1136
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:44,953
[metal clanking]

1137
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:56,047
[horns playing fanfare]

1138
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,635
Cheers.

1139
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:02,720
And stop.

1140
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:08,476
For his treason against the lives

1141
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,273
of the emperors and the Roman state,

1142
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:16,067
General Justus Acacius,

1143
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,488
an enemy of the people!

1144
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:23,074
[all chanting] Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

1145
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,493
- [man] We love you, Acacius!
- You are a hero!

1146
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:29,914
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

1147
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:33,209
[chanting continues]

1148
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:39,174
[crowd roaring]

1149
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:56,149
[crowd jeering loudly]

1150
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:04,032
- [Acacius] <i>Vae victis.</i>
- [soldiers] General.

1151
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,576
[all shouting, grunting]

1152
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:11,873
[pained yell]

1153
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,000
[grunts]

1154
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,927
[crowd cheering]

1155
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:25,970
[panting heavily]

1156
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:28,014
[scattered shouts] Acacius!

1157
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:33,436
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

1158
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:36,981
[all continue chanting]

1159
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,404
[announcer]
From the vanquished city of Numidia,

1160
01:35:44,614 --> 01:35:49,869
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

1161
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:52,455
Go now. <i>Vae victis.</i>

1162
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:59,671
[crowd chanting] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1163
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,090
- Hanno!
- [crowd cheering]

1164
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:04,968
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

1165
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,761
- I will give it to you!
- It's too late.

1166
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:10,139
[announcer] The Roman traitor or

1167
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:12,517
the barbarian hero.

1168
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,061
Let the gods decide.

1169
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:16,813
Lucius... wait.

1170
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:19,565
Wait! Wait!

1171
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,859
[both grunting heavily]

1172
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:29,450
[overlapping cheers and jeers]

1173
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:32,245
I am a vessel.

1174
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,832
Fill me with vengeance

1175
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:39,043
and vanquish the betrayer.

1176
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:45,216
[attacking grunts]

1177
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,147
- We love you, Acacius!
- Move it!

1178
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:04,944
Pick it up!

1179
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:07,405
[woman] Bravo, Hanno!

1180
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:08,948
[man] We love you, Acacius!

1181
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:11,159
- [man 2] What are you waiting for?
- [man 3] You will die!

1182
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:14,203
[cheering and booing]

1183
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,251
[crowd whooping]

1184
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:24,964
[both grunting heavily]

1185
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,345
[crowd groaning]

1186
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:40,396
[pained grunting]

1187
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,065
[panting]

1188
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:43,399
[Acacius]I know who you are.

1189
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,236
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1190
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:56,162
[crowd groaning]

1191
01:37:58,122 --> 01:38:00,500
[crowd exclaiming]

1192
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,543
Acacius has raised his hand!

1193
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:05,922
He has surrendered.

1194
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,341
[all muttering]

1195
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,431
Let the gods decide.

1196
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:25,983
[monkey screeching]

1197
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,868
The gods have rendered their judgment.

1198
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:40,540
Do what you must.

1199
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:44,001
But on my death, you have to know...

1200
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,797
I love your mother, Lucilia.

1201
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:50,633
And your father...

1202
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:54,429
Maximus.

1203
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,932
I would have died for him.

1204
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,892
Kill him!

1205
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,645
[man] Let him live! Please!

1206
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:06,816
[crowd chanting] Live! Live! Live! Live!

1207
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,491
Kill him!

1208
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:18,453
- [grunts]
- [Geta] Kill him!

1209
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:19,787
Archers!

1210
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:21,706
- No!
- [Geta] Kill him!

1211
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:24,333
[crowd chanting] Acacius! Acacius!

1212
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,127
[Caracalla] Kill him!

1213
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,628
Kill him!

1214
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,172
Kill him! Kill him!

1215
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:31,257
[crowd continues chanting]

1216
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,633
[sobbing] Acacius!

1217
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:36,846
[arrow whistling]

1218
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,014
[crowd exclaiming]

1219
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:40,099
[grunting]

1220
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:43,769
[Lucilia] No!

1221
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:45,938
No!

1222
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:47,607
Acacius!

1223
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:51,402
Damn you!

1224
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:54,030
[breath heaving]

1225
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:55,948
Death will be too good for you!

1226
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,665
Is this how Rome treats its heroes?

1227
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,171
Tell me!

1228
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:16,886
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

1229
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:22,016
The gods have spoken!

1230
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:24,644
[crowd booing loudly]

1231
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:29,482
[shouting, jeering]

1232
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:39,575
[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1233
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,707
[crowd booing]

1234
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:58,052
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

1235
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:03,307
[crowd booing loudly]

1236
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:09,605
[crowd] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1237
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:19,282
[all jeering]

1238
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:21,701
[soldier] Stay back! Stay back!

1239
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:51,188
[booing and jeers, echoing]

1240
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,237
[crowd noise fades]

1241
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:09,874
[thunder rolling]

1242
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:14,337
[Lucius, faintly] Arishat!

1243
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:18,883
[door opens]

1244
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:33,439
We had a bargain.

1245
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:40,404
I gave him to you. You let him live.

1246
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:42,156
And you got what you wanted.

1247
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,867
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

1248
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:47,787
You bought a gladiator, not a slave.

1249
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:51,290
My will is my own.

1250
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:54,960
Ah...

1251
01:42:55,044 --> 01:42:56,921
How blue is your blood?

1252
01:42:57,797 --> 01:43:00,383
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

1253
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:02,677
beats in that chest. [chuckles]

1254
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:11,268
The greatest temple Rome ever built.

1255
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:12,895
The Colosseum.

1256
01:43:12,978 --> 01:43:15,314
Because this is what they believe in.

1257
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:16,607
Power.

1258
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:19,819
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

1259
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:21,737
- There has to be something else.
- There is nothing else.

1260
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:24,615
- There has to be another Rome.
- There is no other Rome.

1261
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:27,743
- The "dream"?
- Mm.

1262
01:43:27,827 --> 01:43:29,745
The dream of Rome?

1263
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:31,330
It's an old man's fantasy.

1264
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,500
Who are you?

1265
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:40,589
What was your name
before you traded it for a Roman one?

1266
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:43,092
You'll never know.

1267
01:43:45,928 --> 01:43:47,513
I have a destiny.

1268
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:53,352
The gods delivered you to me.

1269
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:57,898
You will be my instrument.

1270
01:43:57,982 --> 01:44:01,485
I will never be your instrument,
in this life or the next.

1271
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:12,955
- [door opening]
- That will not be my destiny.

1272
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,667
But I will see your end.

1273
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:19,253
[people shouting, yelling in distance]

1274
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:37,605
[monkey chittering]

1275
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,565
What else could I do?

1276
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,442
He and his bitch were plotting to kill us.

1277
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:44,195
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

1278
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:46,322
The Praetorians will put down this crowd.

1279
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:48,157
- Like they have every other.
- You brought this on us.

1280
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,659
- Filthy ape!
- [monkey squeaking in fear]

1281
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:56,040
[Macrinus] Perhaps you should, uh,

1282
01:44:57,166 --> 01:45:01,504
take Dondus elsewhere to comfort him?

1283
01:45:11,096 --> 01:45:13,349
Forgive my brother's outburst.

1284
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:18,270
The disease that infects his loins
has spread to his brain.

1285
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,941
- Every day he gets worse.
- I will reason with him.

1286
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,486
[all yelling, shouting]

1287
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:33,536
[Dondus hooting]

1288
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:41,460
[singsong] I see you.

1289
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,546
I see you.

1290
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:47,174
Caracalla, Caracalla!

1291
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:48,884
Come on, stand up.

1292
01:45:48,968 --> 01:45:51,053
Get up, get up. Not you.

1293
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:52,888
All right, there you go.

1294
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,976
Now, listen to me.

1295
01:45:57,059 --> 01:45:58,644
What's the matter?

1296
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:01,397
[panting] Nothing's ever mine.

1297
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,816
Everything is ours, always.

1298
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:07,069
Even in the womb... [stammering] ...he tried...

1299
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:11,282
to cut my umbilicus

1300
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,200
so that I couldn't have any more air.

1301
01:46:13,284 --> 01:46:15,578
- You remember that, do you?
- Certainly.

1302
01:46:15,661 --> 01:46:17,997
- Come, sit.
- One cannot forget.

1303
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,332
My conscience compels me.

1304
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:21,876
What?

1305
01:46:21,959 --> 01:46:23,168
Sit.

1306
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:24,587
Your brother

1307
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:27,006
means to blame you

1308
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:30,426
in front of the entire Senate...

1309
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:31,886
But I did not do it!

1310
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:33,554
...for what's happening in the streets.

1311
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,015
- The chaos!
- He's lying!

1312
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,933
No testimony can be more damning

1313
01:46:38,017 --> 01:46:41,478
than one brother against another.

1314
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:44,231
That's a lie! He always lies!

1315
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:46,775
He can be very persuasive.

1316
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:49,570
So? What will they do to me?

1317
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:52,448
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

1318
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:54,533
What will they do to Dondus?

1319
01:46:57,703 --> 01:47:00,539
What will they do

1320
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:01,999
to Dondus?

1321
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:04,293
[Dondus chittering softly]

1322
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:05,628
It's your decision.

1323
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:17,681
[people shouting angrily]

1324
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:33,948
[angry shouts continue]

1325
01:47:43,499 --> 01:47:44,333
Brother.

1326
01:47:48,003 --> 01:47:49,797
Put down the blade.

1327
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,006
You lie.

1328
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:52,883
- Give it to me.
- You always lie!

1329
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:53,926
- Give it--
- [grunts]

1330
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:55,594
[chuckles]

1331
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:57,763
[Geta exclaiming]

1332
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:00,099
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

1333
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:02,601
- Lie!
- Listen to me. Break the spell.

1334
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:04,687
- Lie!
- Break the spell!

1335
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:07,940
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

1336
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:10,609
Come back. Help me.

1337
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,704
[blade plunges]

1338
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:24,289
[faint, indistinct chatter]

1339
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:26,083
[keys jingling]

1340
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:34,633
Lucius.

1341
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:43,392
[hinges creaking]

1342
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:59,033
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

1343
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,076
[Lucius chuckles dryly]

1344
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,911
And yet here we are.

1345
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:06,373
Everything has brought us full circle.

1346
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:09,543
You sent me away and yet fate

1347
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:12,087
brought me back
to the very ground where he died.

1348
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:16,091
[Lucilia] This ring...

1349
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,678
belonged to my father.

1350
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:26,852
He gave it to your father, Maximus,

1351
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:28,771
as a token of trust.

1352
01:49:30,189 --> 01:49:33,150
I gave it to Acacius for his valor.

1353
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:39,865
This ring belonged to my wife.

1354
01:49:42,868 --> 01:49:44,328
I shall wear it next to yours.

1355
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:01,053
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1356
01:50:02,387 --> 01:50:05,182
I could not see the man.

1357
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:06,558
[sniffles]

1358
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:09,228
He was a soldier of Rome.

1359
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:12,564
There was a plan.

1360
01:50:13,899 --> 01:50:17,319
He was readying troops at Ostia
under the command of Darius Sextus.

1361
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:21,490
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

1362
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:27,913
Acacius. Maximus. Marcus Aurelius.

1363
01:50:29,081 --> 01:50:30,707
They lived and died for Rome.

1364
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:33,585
We all do.

1365
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:37,256
Is it true they intend to kill you?

1366
01:50:39,216 --> 01:50:40,926
[chuckles lightly]

1367
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:43,220
One man or another
has had a sword against my neck

1368
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,430
since the day my father died.

1369
01:50:48,684 --> 01:50:50,644
But now that I've found you,

1370
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,272
it doesn't matter.

1371
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:56,066
I am not afraid.

1372
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:59,570
I've become well versed
in losing the things that I love.

1373
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:05,576
But now that I've found you,
I have no desire to lose you again.

1374
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:07,077
[exhales shakily]

1375
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,831
- You stand like him.
- Mm.

1376
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:12,958
Alert.

1377
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:14,960
Proud.

1378
01:51:17,212 --> 01:51:19,047
I do not have his strength.

1379
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:22,801
I wish that were true.

1380
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:27,389
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

1381
01:51:27,472 --> 01:51:28,974
[keys jingling]

1382
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:34,730
[door unlocks]

1383
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:37,232
Go now.

1384
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:44,072
[Lucilia sighs]

1385
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:46,700
Strength and honor.

1386
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:50,871
Strength and honor.

1387
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,467
[thunder rumbling faintly]

1388
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:04,968
[Caracalla] As Emperor,

1389
01:52:05,761 --> 01:52:07,346
I have convened

1390
01:52:08,347 --> 01:52:11,600
the Senate to appoint my First Consul

1391
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:15,020
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

1392
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:18,315
and civic functions of the Empire.

1393
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:23,528
I name...

1394
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:27,157
Citizen Dondus!

1395
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:29,034
[Senate murmuring]

1396
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,536
[Dondus chittering]

1397
01:52:34,122 --> 01:52:35,749
[Caracalla] Hail Dondus!

1398
01:52:39,211 --> 01:52:40,671
Hail Dondus!

1399
01:52:42,714 --> 01:52:45,425
- [clearing throat] Hail Dondus.
- Hail Dondus!

1400
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:47,970
[all] Hail Dondus!

1401
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,059
As Second Consul...

1402
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:57,479
I name...

1403
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:01,149
Citizen...

1404
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:04,319
Macrinus!

1405
01:53:07,281 --> 01:53:08,991
Hail Macrinus!

1406
01:53:09,074 --> 01:53:10,575
Hail Macrinus!

1407
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,536
[all] Hail Macrinus!

1408
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:16,999
There will be
a triumphal parade to celebrate.

1409
01:53:17,082 --> 01:53:18,583
There will be games

1410
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,378
and mass executions.

1411
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,839
[chittering]

1412
01:53:24,506 --> 01:53:27,175
Long live the Empire!

1413
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,763
- [Macrinus] Long live the Empire!
- [all] Long live the Empire!

1414
01:53:35,183 --> 01:53:36,893
[applause subsides]

1415
01:53:38,687 --> 01:53:39,855
Sit down.

1416
01:53:43,275 --> 01:53:45,944
I happen to have...

1417
01:53:49,531 --> 01:53:53,201
with good fortune and not a little skill...

1418
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:58,081
the remaining emperor's ear.

1419
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,919
[all gasping, murmuring]

1420
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:07,549
I can speak logic to it...

1421
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:14,806
and tame the madness in the street. But...

1422
01:54:17,809 --> 01:54:19,394
to restore order...

1423
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,315
I must have power...

1424
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:29,071
and command

1425
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,740
over the Praetorian Army.

1426
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,373
Ballot...

1427
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:42,918
or hand?

1428
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:47,589
- Aye!
- [all] Aye!

1429
01:54:50,926 --> 01:54:52,511
Your humble servant.

1430
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:58,183
Put your hands down.

1431
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:02,354
You can sit down.

1432
01:55:15,951 --> 01:55:17,536
[Macrinus] <i>Rome must fall.</i>

1433
01:55:20,288 --> 01:55:22,290
I need only give it a push.

1434
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:27,546
[Lucilia] And after Rome falls...

1435
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:30,882
[dry chuckle] ...what then?

1436
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:35,053
You are your father's child.

1437
01:55:37,055 --> 01:55:39,683
His dream of Rome was never a dream.

1438
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:41,852
It was a fiction.

1439
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:45,063
"The best revenge is

1440
01:55:45,147 --> 01:55:49,025
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1441
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:54,114
I have made myself unlike your father.

1442
01:55:54,197 --> 01:55:57,742
He spoke of dreams, I speak of truth.

1443
01:55:57,826 --> 01:56:00,245
And the only truth in my Rome

1444
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,832
is the law of the strongest.

1445
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:07,502
I was owned

1446
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,505
by an emperor.

1447
01:56:13,508 --> 01:56:15,594
Now I control an empire.

1448
01:56:16,678 --> 01:56:19,931
Where else but in Rome can a man do that?

1449
01:56:25,228 --> 01:56:29,733
Do you recognize your father's mark on me?

1450
01:56:34,571 --> 01:56:35,864
If there is anything

1451
01:56:36,615 --> 01:56:37,949
you need...

1452
01:56:39,701 --> 01:56:41,369
in these last hours,

1453
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:44,039
we will provide.

1454
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:52,464
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

1455
01:56:54,382 --> 01:56:57,385
Tomorrow there will be games.

1456
01:56:57,469 --> 01:56:59,054
And at them...

1457
01:56:59,971 --> 01:57:01,640
I will prevail.

1458
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:08,980
[door clangs shut]

1459
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:10,732
[keys jingling]

1460
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:16,780
Ravi!

1461
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:25,664
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

1462
01:57:25,747 --> 01:57:27,499
What is in Ostia?

1463
01:57:27,582 --> 01:57:29,000
There is an army.

1464
01:57:31,253 --> 01:57:32,963
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

1465
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:35,173
in the service of something greater.

1466
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:39,511
Ride to Ostia.

1467
01:57:40,762 --> 01:57:42,889
Take this ring to General Darius Sextus.

1468
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:44,349
Are you listening?

1469
01:57:45,016 --> 01:57:46,851
Darius Sextus.

1470
01:57:47,769 --> 01:57:49,771
He will know it as Acacius's ring.

1471
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,859
[clears throat] And, uh,

1472
01:57:55,777 --> 01:57:57,112
who shall I say has

1473
01:57:57,821 --> 01:57:59,489
sent me with this ring?

1474
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:05,203
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1475
01:58:06,454 --> 01:58:07,956
The Prince of Rome.

1476
01:58:09,207 --> 01:58:13,044
Tell him I am summoning the army
to the defense of a new Republic.

1477
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:17,674
[inhales]

1478
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,555
- Should I trust you?
- Yes.

1479
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:25,098
- Should I?
- Yes.

1480
01:58:32,022 --> 01:58:34,691
Ravi! I need your keys.

1481
01:58:40,822 --> 01:58:42,490
Thank you.

1482
01:59:20,362 --> 01:59:22,781
Stop! Come back!

1483
01:59:35,293 --> 01:59:37,337
[panting]

1484
01:59:44,511 --> 01:59:45,679
[inhales sharply]

1485
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:54,688
Who gave you this?

1486
01:59:55,689 --> 01:59:57,816
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1487
01:59:59,067 --> 02:00:00,276
The Prince of Rome.

1488
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:23,758
[horses snort, whinnying]

1489
02:00:28,847 --> 02:00:31,224
[crowd cheering in distance]

1490
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:55,665
[whispering] Must we kill Lucilia?

1491
02:00:58,126 --> 02:01:01,880
[quietly] Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1492
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:04,799
Ever.

1493
02:01:07,886 --> 02:01:09,971
[horns playing fanfare]

1494
02:01:15,685 --> 02:01:18,313
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1495
02:01:18,396 --> 02:01:20,982
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1496
02:01:21,065 --> 02:01:24,068
I shall deliver them Caracalla's head
and the people shall acclaim me.

1497
02:01:24,152 --> 02:01:27,739
That, my friend, is politics.

1498
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:32,410
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1499
02:01:47,675 --> 02:01:49,803
Today will be your last fight, champion.

1500
02:01:50,887 --> 02:01:52,514
And our master has bestowed on you...

1501
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:57,268
the wooden sword of freedom.

1502
02:02:01,272 --> 02:02:03,316
But you have to earn it first.

1503
02:02:03,399 --> 02:02:05,735
Today, you're gonna defend your mother.

1504
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:14,661
- [soldier shouting]
- [grunting]

1505
02:02:14,744 --> 02:02:16,955
[all yelling]

1506
02:02:25,463 --> 02:02:28,591
[grunting explosively]

1507
02:02:28,675 --> 02:02:31,511
Wood or steel, a point is still a point!

1508
02:02:34,013 --> 02:02:35,723
[arrows whistling]

1509
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:00,290
[Lucius] Wait for me.

1510
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:20,894
In honor

1511
02:03:20,977 --> 02:03:25,315
of the acclamation of Emperor Caracalla,

1512
02:03:25,398 --> 02:03:31,362
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1513
02:03:31,446 --> 02:03:35,992
and as punishment for her conspiracy
against the empire,

1514
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:40,580
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1515
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:44,500
and for fomenting military mutiny
along with her husband,

1516
02:03:44,584 --> 02:03:48,254
the queen will face divine justice

1517
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:52,425
at the hands of the Praetorian Guard.

1518
02:03:56,679 --> 02:03:59,098
[crowd cheering faintly]

1519
02:04:16,908 --> 02:04:18,409
I am not a general.

1520
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:23,623
But we are all soldiers.

1521
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,418
And up until now,

1522
02:04:27,961 --> 02:04:31,798
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1523
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:33,716
What will you have us do?

1524
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:38,429
Well, you can return to your cells
if you do not wish to fight this battle.

1525
02:04:38,513 --> 02:04:40,807
- [all laughing]
- Or...

1526
02:04:42,558 --> 02:04:43,893
you can join me.

1527
02:04:45,186 --> 02:04:47,897
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1528
02:04:47,981 --> 02:04:48,982
[all] Aye!

1529
02:04:49,732 --> 02:04:53,528
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1530
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:56,739
In this Rome

1531
02:04:57,657 --> 02:04:59,826
I no longer believe that exists.

1532
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:01,911
We must find it!

1533
02:05:01,995 --> 02:05:04,080
[all murmuring in agreement]

1534
02:05:04,163 --> 02:05:05,832
[Lucius] And know this:

1535
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:10,920
Where death is, we are not.

1536
02:05:12,922 --> 02:05:14,841
Where we are,

1537
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:17,301
death is not!

1538
02:05:20,346 --> 02:05:21,597
By my sword.

1539
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:25,268
Strength and honor.

1540
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:27,311
[all] Strength and honor!

1541
02:05:27,395 --> 02:05:29,063
Strength and honor!

1542
02:05:29,147 --> 02:05:30,982
Strength and honor!

1543
02:05:40,575 --> 02:05:43,202
[indistinct shouting]

1544
02:05:43,286 --> 02:05:45,121
[growling]

1545
02:05:50,418 --> 02:05:52,545
[snarling]

1546
02:05:55,715 --> 02:05:57,842
Let it not be said

1547
02:05:57,925 --> 02:06:01,054
that the emperor is not merciful.

1548
02:06:01,888 --> 02:06:06,642
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1549
02:06:06,726 --> 02:06:10,521
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

1550
02:06:10,605 --> 02:06:12,774
[crowd jeering]

1551
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:24,494
The champion, Hanno!

1552
02:06:24,577 --> 02:06:26,579
[crowd roars]

1553
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:31,834
[people chanting] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1554
02:06:51,229 --> 02:06:53,356
[all booing]

1555
02:07:24,929 --> 02:07:26,806
[all shouting]

1556
02:07:35,523 --> 02:07:37,400
[grunting]

1557
02:07:37,483 --> 02:07:39,193
Yes!

1558
02:07:43,406 --> 02:07:45,241
Summon the cavalry. Put this down at once.

1559
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:49,162
This is war! Real war!

1560
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:57,503
The army of Acacius is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1561
02:08:00,173 --> 02:08:01,632
We can still outflank them.

1562
02:08:01,716 --> 02:08:04,051
They have only 5,000 troops, no more.

1563
02:08:05,428 --> 02:08:06,929
How many are we?

1564
02:08:07,013 --> 02:08:08,389
Six thousand. Perhaps more.

1565
02:08:08,472 --> 02:08:10,141
Ride to the gate and hold them.

1566
02:08:10,224 --> 02:08:12,143
[aggressive grunting]

1567
02:08:20,193 --> 02:08:21,611
[cheering]

1568
02:08:35,583 --> 02:08:36,959
[screams]

1569
02:08:37,043 --> 02:08:39,128
[yelps, whimpering]

1570
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:46,177
[screams]

1571
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,763
[all shouting angrily]

1572
02:08:52,683 --> 02:08:53,976
[screams]

1573
02:08:56,312 --> 02:08:58,064
- [arrow whistles]
- [grunts]

1574
02:09:01,901 --> 02:09:02,944
Filthy scum!

1575
02:09:16,832 --> 02:09:18,334
[Lucilia] Lucius!

1576
02:09:20,127 --> 02:09:21,170
Give me the bow.

1577
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:26,175
[bow creaking]

1578
02:09:30,805 --> 02:09:32,890
[both gasp]

1579
02:09:44,986 --> 02:09:47,530
Go, my son. Lucius--

1580
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:48,698
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1581
02:09:48,948 --> 02:09:50,283
Horse!

1582
02:09:50,366 --> 02:09:52,493
[people shouting, clamoring]

1583
02:09:57,581 --> 02:09:59,583
[yelling furiously]

1584
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:14,098
[indistinct shouts]

1585
02:10:15,224 --> 02:10:17,143
[feet marching]

1586
02:10:17,226 --> 02:10:19,687
[man shouting cadence]

1587
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,127
Will nothing kill this barbarian?

1588
02:11:25,211 --> 02:11:27,755
My name is Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1589
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:30,216
[Macrinus] A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1590
02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:33,052
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1591
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:34,970
Are you such a man as this?

1592
02:11:35,054 --> 02:11:36,514
[Lucius] I don't fight for power.

1593
02:11:37,306 --> 02:11:40,935
I fight to free Rome from men like you
and to return it to them.

1594
02:11:41,018 --> 02:11:43,854
The gods themselves want Rome reborn.

1595
02:11:43,938 --> 02:11:46,899
They sent me... to fulfill that task.

1596
02:11:46,982 --> 02:11:50,569
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1597
02:11:50,653 --> 02:11:51,654
Huh?

1598
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:55,116
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1599
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:57,118
[aggressive yell]

1600
02:12:03,124 --> 02:12:05,167
[horses bellowing]

1601
02:12:15,553 --> 02:12:18,180
[both grunting]

1602
02:12:19,807 --> 02:12:21,267
[swords clashing]

1603
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:22,935
[both yelling]

1604
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:33,320
- Hah!
- [screams]

1605
02:12:34,405 --> 02:12:35,281
[grunts]

1606
02:12:51,422 --> 02:12:53,090
[blade clanging against breastplate]

1607
02:13:00,055 --> 02:13:03,142
[metallic clangs echoing]

1608
02:13:03,851 --> 02:13:05,227
[Lucilia] Strength and honor,

1609
02:13:05,311 --> 02:13:06,812
my son.

1610
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:10,232
[grunts]

1611
02:13:23,787 --> 02:13:24,955
[yelling]

1612
02:13:26,874 --> 02:13:27,958
[groans in pain]

1613
02:13:55,402 --> 02:13:56,779
[panting]

1614
02:13:56,862 --> 02:13:58,656
[pained groan]

1615
02:14:40,197 --> 02:14:41,907
You look to me to speak.

1616
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:47,913
I know not what to say other than
we have all known too much death.

1617
02:14:49,164 --> 02:14:52,668
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1618
02:14:56,630 --> 02:14:59,174
My grandfather, Marcus Aurelius,

1619
02:14:59,258 --> 02:15:02,094
talked of a dream that would be Rome.

1620
02:15:03,137 --> 02:15:05,014
A dream that my father,

1621
02:15:06,265 --> 02:15:08,434
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1622
02:15:09,184 --> 02:15:10,686
died for.

1623
02:15:11,937 --> 02:15:13,522
An ideal.

1624
02:15:16,275 --> 02:15:20,070
A city for the many
and a refuge for those in need.

1625
02:15:20,738 --> 02:15:23,198
A home worth fighting for.

1626
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:28,621
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1627
02:15:30,706 --> 02:15:32,541
That dream is lost.

1628
02:15:38,505 --> 02:15:40,132
But dare we...

1629
02:15:41,675 --> 02:15:44,303
rebuild that dream together?

1630
02:15:56,231 --> 02:15:57,983
What say you?

1631
02:16:04,365 --> 02:16:06,200
Aye!

1632
02:16:07,368 --> 02:16:08,661
Aye!

1633
02:16:09,411 --> 02:16:10,663
Aye!

1634
02:16:10,746 --> 02:16:15,084
[all] Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1635
02:16:17,419 --> 02:16:20,798
[all chanting]

1636
02:17:19,815 --> 02:17:20,983
Mother.

1637
02:18:13,577 --> 02:18:15,746
Speak to me, Father.

Valhalla, this is Thor.

Valhalla, this is Thor.

7
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,364
We have visual on a possible
high-value target.

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:18,829
Thor, this is Valhalla.
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,706
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

10
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,376
Contact Loki

11
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,128
Loki, this is Thor.

12
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,550
Target is located

Verifying target ID.

[technician 3]
SecDef is arriving now.

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,448

25
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,211
[technician 3] Got it.

26
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,090
Now, don't tell me
you spotted the beard

27
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,425
in the middle of
a goddamn sandstorm.

28
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,593
Is it really him?

29
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,720
We're confirming
that now, sir.

30
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,139
Sir, audio is coming up now.
Verifying voice pattern match.

31
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,390
What do we have
here, Sergeant?

32
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,562
Four males.
One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

33
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,439
consistent with our intel
on Al-Khoei.

35
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,611
[technician 3]
Sir, it's just coming up.

36
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,404
"Thirty-seven percent"
and "probable"

37
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,239
don't belong in
the same sentence.

38
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,117
I'm not taking
this to the President.

39
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,078
[director over monitor]
CIA and NCTC concur
it is the target,

40
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,871
based on reliable intel
from the Brits.

41
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:43,956

[officer 1] Criteria is not met.
Recommend abort.

46
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,726
[officer 2] We have
an abort recommendation.

47
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,812
If it's him, this guy
comes out of hiding

48
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,730
every couple of years
at best.

49
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,274
[officer 1] Sir, target
is appearing around
the northeast corner.

50
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,239
[technician 1] We've got
AK-47s, RPGs and
Chaparral guided missiles.

51
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,199
This is a training camp,
Mr. Secretary.

52
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,243
[technician 2]
Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.

53
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,244
[officer 1] 51%.

54
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,705
Abort rec still holds.

55
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,414
[officer 1] All other PID
options exhausted.

56
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,625
What do you
suggest we do, sir?

57
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,420
Is that a weapons cache?

58
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,506
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

59
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,257
marker for the
five pillars of Islam.

60
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,592
I think it's a funeral.

61
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,136
For Christ's sake.

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,931
Counsel, how many ways
would this violate
the Geneva Convention?

63
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,017
We can invoke hors de combat.

64
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,435
[General council] There's no
independent intel verifying

65
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,937
that this is,
in fact, a funeral.

66
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,107
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

67
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,034
Mr. President,

68
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,787
we have a 51% identity
match on Majid al-Khoei.

69
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,541
The bad news is,
there's some possibility
he's at a funeral.

70
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,502
You should also be
aware we have an
abort recommendation.

71
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,672
But the Joint Chiefs
are urging a go.

72
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,592
[President] All right,
what's your recommendation?

73
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:30,104
Sir, we measure success
by the least amount of
collateral damage.

74
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,524
At 51% probability,
the risk is too high.

75
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,861
[President] And if it is
Al-Khoei and he walks,

76
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,947
I'm putting our people
at risk.

77
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,866
You have a go.

78
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,038
Thank you, Mr. President.

79
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,878

-[technician 1] We have
weapons hot!

Loki, you are
cleared to engage.

81
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,214
[technician 1]
Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

82
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,592
[technician 1] We have handshake
with the MQ9 Reaper.
Sending you images now.

83
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,094

Missiles away.

89
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,909
[technician 1]
Ten seconds to impact.

[praying in Arabic]

91
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,184
You got to make
a choice, fellas.

92
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,772
Who are you going to be?
Boys or men?

93
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,319
I'm out on this one.

94
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,236
Why?

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,237
'Cause I'm broke.

96
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,488
Come...

97
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,157
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,074
Kwame just paired
the board.

99
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,701
I'm floating on the river here.
Look at the table.

100
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,870
I don't know. I'm supposed
to take my girl out later.

101
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,829
It's a lot of money.

102
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,165
Your girl out?
Who's that?

103
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,292
-Elaine?
-Yeah.

104
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,336
You guys have been
going out for a while.

105
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,296
How long?

106
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,421
Couple months.

107
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,715
Couple months? Wow.

108
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,133
That's big.
You have sex with her yet?

109
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,135
Kinda.

110
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,220
-What the hell is "kinda"?
-[Kwame] "Kinda"?

111
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,804
-[Gino] Personal question.
-Okay, well, listen.

112
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,639
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going
to do tonight?

113
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,058
Fish fillet and a Coke?

114
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,851
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

115
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,644
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

116
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,979
-How'd you know?
-Well, that's what you do.

117
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,772
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

118
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,233
-You know what you should do?
-Hmm?

119
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,985
You need to lay down some real
green and treat your lady right.

120
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,987
You know, you need
to take her to a nice place.

121
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,115
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

122
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,742
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

123
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,244
Girls want to go out.

124
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,953
Especially a girl as cute
as your girl, you know?

125
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,331
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

126
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,999
So you take her to the movies.

127
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,751
-A little popcorn-drink combo.
-True. True.

128
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,502
Elaine might want
a hot dog and some nachos,

129
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,921
so you shell out for that, too.

130
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,339
And then before you know it,

131
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,840
she's cozying up the way
she never would've

132
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,758
at her mom's house, you know?

133
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,301
-Preach it. Preach it.
-Now all of a sudden, look.

134
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,803
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

135
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,430
all because he dared
to dream tonight.

136
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,681
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-And he became a man.

137
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,599
-And that's the choice.
-Yes.

138
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,018
And that's what's on the table.
This is the dream right here.

139
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,478
Are you a man?

140
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,231
-I'm with you.
-Okay, here we go.

141
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,523
-I'm with you. 20?
-20.

142
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,566
Big boy game.

143
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,777
[Gino] Call.

144
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,112
Cowboys over aces, big Jer.

145
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,113
[whooping]

146
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,072
Wow. Wow.

147
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,031
-Didn't see that coming, huh?
-Yeah, that's a tough one.

148
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,367
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

149
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,368
Get out of here!

150
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,328
You baited me into that, Jer.
Come on!

151
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,246
That's the way it goes.

152
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,205
So what happened
to Red Lobster?

153
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,831
No, I guess it's Mama's
house for you tonight.

154
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,166
But look,
I saved you 40 bucks.

155
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,334
And now Elaine won't
have to shell out

156
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,419
for herpes medication.

157
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,879
Break's over, bitches.

158
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,256
Freitag missed
his shift again.

159
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,465
-Someone's on collator duty.
-[Kwame] Great.

160
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,426
All right,
well, gentlemen,

161
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,344
I'll give you a chance to win
some of this back tomorrow.

162
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,470
Enjoy yourselves.

163
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,596
[Kwame] All right, man.

164
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,272
Hey there. Welcome
to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

165
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,232
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

166
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,858
-That machine there?
-Yeah.

167
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,944
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

168
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,779
-Didn't do that.
-Well, that's your problem.

169
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,072
Why don't you try it again?

170
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,335

allowing them to eavesdrop
on you and your conversations.

177
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,267
Experts say the
only way around this

178
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,727
is to take the battery
out of the device.

Mrs. Wierzbowski!
I was just...

192
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,882

Then see if she give
you money for rent.

208

[Mr. Shaw sighs]

215
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,092
Six months without
a boo or a bah, huh?

216
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,927
Yes, sir.

217
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,304
So where were you this time?

218
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,310
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

219
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,774
I... I spoke to Stanford.

220
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,986
I pulled some strings.
They said they'd take you back.

221
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,863
-Even though you took off...
-Two years ago, Dad.

222
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,157
Jerry, you know,
it wouldn't kill you

223
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,284
to ask for help
once in a while.

224
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,993
You want to have
this conversation now?

225
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,621
-It's Stanford!
-You want to do this today.

226
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,580

You always have.

231
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:21,842
You know, I keep thinking,

232
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,344
I'm going to walk
in here one day

233
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:29,183
and I'm not going to feel like
a stranger in my own house.

234
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,780
I don't want your money.

235

your attention, please?

236

Can't find the keys

240
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,172
I'm going to
have to take you.

241
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,215

242
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,593
All right, wait
five more minutes.

00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,221
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

244

I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV.

245
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,394
I went over, said, "No TV,
no TV, no TV." Turned it off.

246

Came over here.
Checked the messages.

247

Knocked over the phone.

248
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,899
Right, knocked over
the phone. Put it back.

Put the leftovers
in the fridge.

the big send-off, do you, huh?

going to lie about it.

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,895
I mean, I don't know what
I'm doing in this room, sir.

347
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,482
It's cold as hell outside.

348
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,110
You draw?

349
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:55,862
I what?

350
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,071
Do you draw?
Do you sketch?

351
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,656
You have ink
all over your fingers.

352
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,202
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

353
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,745
I mean, this is all
some kind of sick joke.

354
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,788
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

355
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,831
Obviously.

356
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,666
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

357
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:11,961
Did you love your brother?

358
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,298
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

359
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,095
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

360
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,059
When's the last time
you saw him?

361
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,562
Christmas.

362
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,813
This past Christmas?

363
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,816
Three Christmases ago.

364
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,026
Three years, huh?

365
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,944
Well, the phone records
show that you

366
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,238
haven't even called him
in over a year.

367
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,324
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

368
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,784
No MySpace or
Facebook messages?

369
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,285
Yeah, so what are you
trying to say? We're not...

370
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,746
Are you asking if
we're the type of twins

371
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,997
that wear the same shirt
to the mall,

372
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,916
hold hands,
and things like that? No.

373
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,752
Sir, I don't even
know your name.

374
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,045
I'm sorry,
that was rude of me.

375
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,629
I'm Tom Morgan,

376
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,131
the Supervising Agent
assigned

377
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,966
to the Joint Terrorism
Task Force.

378
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,300
Ter...

379
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,053
[scoffing]

380
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,303
You think I'm a terrorist?

381
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,513
[laughs]

382
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,265
No, you're a copy boy,
aren't you?

383
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,516
I'm a copy associate.

384
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,642
Copy associate.

385
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,145
But your brother,
[clears throat]

386
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,688
it says here
he was a little more,

387
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,857
I guess you'd say,
ambitious than you.

388
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,359
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

389
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,029
with an advanced degree
in parallel algorithms

390
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,114
and quantum electronics.

391
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,282
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

392
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,534
Cadet wing commander,
valedictorian,

393
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,493
plum job in
the Public Affairs...

394
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,578
Yeah, no, I know
what he did, sir.

395
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,496
Why'd you drop out
of school, Jerry?

396
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,540
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

397
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,459
No, school just
wasn't for me.

398
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,087
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

399
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,714
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

400
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,883
I see you did
a little backpacking.

401
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,343
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

402
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,762
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

403
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,055
Look, none of this
has anything to do

404
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,723
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

405
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,017
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

406
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,310
I'd have to be
the dumbest terrorist

407
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,603
in the history of the world.

408
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,063
So who deposited the 750?

409
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,107
The... I don't know who
deposited the 750!

410
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,985
God maybe?
I thought it was a miracle,

411
00:21:59,068 --> 00:21:59,902
I took the money.

412
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,154
That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

413
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,030
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

414
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:07,076
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

415
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,535
Well, I'll be darned,
Singapore.

416
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,997
Opened with a transfer
from a corporation

417
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,082
called The Star of Orion,
a dummy front for Hezbollah.

418
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,250
This is all very
interesting, sir.

419
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,209
It has nothing to do with me.

420
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,170
We find hardware
in your apartment.

421
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,213
Latest military spec.

422
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,798
-Airplane manuals.
-I told you about this already.

423
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,801
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

424
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,844
I walked into my apartment...

425
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,553
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

426
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,931
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

427
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,308
and this shit's all
over my apartment.

428
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,600
-It just showed up.
-It just showed up.

429
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,601
I see.

430
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,728
I'm just curious if your brother
knew anything about it.

431
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,939
Of course, we haven't
really established

432
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,025
how close you guys
were yet, have we?

433
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,193
Well, we were pretty
close this morning

434
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,652
when I buried his body
in the ground.

435
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,154
Does that establish
anything for you?

436
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,488
Somebody set me up.

437
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,865
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

438
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:46,866
-"Somebody."
-Yeah.

439
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,825
A woman called
me on the phone.

440
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,784
She told me I was
going to be arrested.

441
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,203
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

442
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,079
I don't know! If I knew,
I would tell you!

443
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,206
I don't know!

444
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,253
Here's the thing, Jerry.

445
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,922
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

446
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,217
You read the paper.

447
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,844
Who do you think is winning?

448
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,638
Your Miranda rights
or my right to keep you

449
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,389
in this room
as long as I want to?

450
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,977
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

451
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,979
I don't care
who you work for.

452
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,690
'Cause no matter
what you tell me,

453
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,236
you're in a shitload
of trouble, son.

454
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,578
This is insane.
I work for Copy Cabana.

455
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,829
Yeah, that's what
you said.

456
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,797
Listen, I get one night
out in a decade, ladies,

457
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,341
I am not wasting it
on Lemon Drops.

458
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,843
-Okay.
-Buck up. Let's go.

459
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,142
Oh, gosh.

460
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,644
I want updates.
Catfights, booty calls,

461
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,938
somebody tell me
they got lucky.

462
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,940
Hey, ladies.
See that guy over there?

463
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,649
He'd like to buy you a round.

464
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,194
[chuckling] Hell, no.

465
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,779
He's got light beer
written all over him.

466
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,780
-He's cute.
-Come on.

467
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,697
[cell phone ringing]

468
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,615
-He's a suit.
-No.

469
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,532
You sure?

470
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,784
-[friend 1] Come on.
-[friend 2] Who is it?

471
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,785
[sighing]

472
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,037
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

473
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,622
Aww. That's sweet.

474
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,291
All right, don't drink
those without me.

475
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,044
Hello?

476
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,421
Hello?

477
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,632
[woman] There's
a McDonald's across the street.

478
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,925
Look in the window.

479
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,427
What is this?

480
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,595
Would you risk your life
for your son?

481
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,729
Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated.

482
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,688
This isn't funny.

483
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,731
Your compliance is vital.

484
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,690
Who are you?

485
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,943
We will derail his train,
unless you do what you're told.

486
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,569
What is this?

487
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,405
Don't go back
inside the restaurant.

488
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,323
What?

489
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,241
There's a black Porsche Cayenne

490
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,368
parked at the northeast corner
of this block.

491
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,578
The keys are in the ignition.

492
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,205
Start walking.

493
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,707
[panting]

494
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,792
Oh, my God.

495
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,752
[dialing number]

496
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,255
[man on phone] 911.

497
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,381
State the nature
of your emergency.

498
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:08,757
Yeah, some woman
just called me.

499
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,426
I have... I have no idea
who she is.

500
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,718
She was telling me that...

501
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,346
[high-pitched feedback
on phone]

502
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,683
[woman] Your phone
is being monitored.

503
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,353
Disobey again
and your son dies.

504
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,401
Hey, Grant,
I can't read this Shaw file.

505
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,694
Grant!

506
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,862
Excuse me.

507
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,780
Listen, my eyes
aren't getting any better

508
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,240
and these screens
are getting smaller.

509
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,700
Could you please find me
something I can read?

510
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,160
I can make the text
bigger on your screen.

511
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,786
No, no, no.
I'm talking about paper.

512
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,246
Remember, like in
the olden times?

513
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,914
-Paper. Okay.
-Yeah.

514
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,876
Agent Morgan.
Zoe Perez, Air Force
Special Investigations.

515
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,212
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

516
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,672
Yeah. OSI said they were
sending a liaison.

517
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,133
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

518
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,385
I'll do my best.

519
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,261
File says he died in
a traffic accident.

520
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,346
Truck ran a light,

00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,890
corner of Constitution
and 10th, Northwest D.C.

522
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,851
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

523
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,936
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

524
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,439
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

525
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,358
I mean, don't you find
that a little coincidental?

526
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,901
[Perez] What if it's a decoy?

527
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,653
To distract us from
something 50 times bigger.

[door opening]

529
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,084
Time for your phone call.

00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,793
I thought I didn't get one.

531
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,795
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

532
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,926
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

533
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,470
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

534
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,055
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

535
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,224
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

536
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,726
Or that he was somehow slipping
intel to the Copy Cabana?

537
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,770
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

538
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,815
was a superstar rocket scientist
genius who did go wrong,

539
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:49,942
and the Air Force
doesn't want

540
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,985
their dirty laundry
flapping in the wind.

541
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,447
Think what you like,
but I need to get in that room

542
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,906
and interrogate him myself.

543
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,074
No.

You don't have
a choice. Look.

546
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,587
Now, neither of us know

547
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,671
if either of those brothers
are guilty or innocent,

548
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,091
so on behalf of the
Secretary of the Air Force,

549
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,426
I'm going in that room.

550

We have planned your escape.

How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

556
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,908
Lay flat on the floor
immediately.

are you talking about?

558

Four seconds, Jerry.

559

No, this is bullshit.
I don't...

560
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:44,955
Get down now.

561
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,499

00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,589
Proceed to
the end of the dock.

699
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,967
We will eliminate
all obstacles for you.

700
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,143
Watch! Watch! Watch!

701
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,192
[gasps]

702
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:16,800
Stay your course.

703
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,801
[Jerry] Turn!

704
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,512
Turn!

705
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,930
Turn right now.

706
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,061
[gasps]

707
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,905
[both panting]

708
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,073
Holy...

709
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,159
[both gasping]

710
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,874
[buzzing]

711
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,753
[Rachel] Oh, God.

712
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,297
Oh, my God!

713
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,344
-Grab the seat.
-I can't.

714
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,846
Grab the seat! The seat!

715
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,222
No, I can't!

716
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,308
No!

717
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,609
[both yelling]

718
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,156
[woman over GPS] The crane
will release the car.

719
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,033
If you do not jump,
you will drown.

720
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,534
-We have to jump.
-No!

721
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,745
No way.

722
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,914
We have to. When I say "go."

723
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,166
[grunting]

724
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,168
Ready?

725
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,629
Go! Jump!

726
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,297
[Jerry screams]

727
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,799
[Rachel screams]

728
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,437
[siren wailing]

729
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,609
[Morgan] I want both
the divers in that water!

730
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,782
-Let's go! Move!
-[agent 1] Let's go, let's go!

731
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,242
[agent 2] Move,
move, move!

732
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,911
[bird chirping]

733
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,010
[coast guard]
Yeah, I already called it in!

734
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,553
Wait till it clears!

735
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,389
30 feet back, that's it!

736
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,142
Yeah, I know, the Army
sent a Black Hawk,

737
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,768
so I'll be there in
a couple of hours.

738
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,729
[Grant] What do you mean,
the car is not registered
to anyone?

739
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,189
Check the VIN number again.

740
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,733
[Sam over cell phone] Leave
your message for Sam,

741
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,027
even though I know
it's you, Mom.

742
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:41,945
[beep]

743
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,614
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

744
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,783
You need to call me as soon
as you get this message, okay?

745
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,702
Baby, please.

746
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,497
I love you.

747
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,959
-What about the girl?
-What?

748
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,418
What about the girl?

749
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,504
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

750
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,174
a seven-minute equipment
failure on their traffic cams.

751
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,925
-We didn't get a picture of her.
-Don't tell me that.

752
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,010
That's what
they're telling me!

753
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,511
I need an ID on that girl.

754
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,598
Do you think they
could derail a train?

755
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,978
They changed every traffic
light to get us here.

756
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,813
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

757
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,939
who happened to be
sitting next to me.

758
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,316
Never met the guy in my life.

759
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,193
You know, and then they broke
me out of maximum
security custody

760
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,527
in a way I'm not even
gonna describe to you

761
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,611
because it sounds crazy,

762
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,030
and then they lift
us off the face of the Earth

763
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,781
and drop us
into this shit pile?

764
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,533
She could probably
derail a train.

765
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,327
She could probably turn
a train into a talking duck.

766
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,038
[Morgan] And what about
these goddamn ghost cranes

767
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,622
that keep helping peewee out?

768
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,082
I mean, they don't
just lift cars

769
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,583
up in the air
all by themselves

770
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,169
like a giant pair
of chopsticks.

771
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,380
I want to know how these things
run, how they're programmed.

772
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,341
What'd you say
your name was?

773
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:45,884
Rachel.

774
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,052
I'm Jerry.

775
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,304
[cell phone ringing]

776
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,643
Hello?

777
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,354
[woman] The barge will
dock in 14 minutes.

778
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,480
Leave the boatyard
with the female.

779
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,774
Take Highway 123 East.

780
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,860
Walk to mile marker 108.

781
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,779
What? Was it her?

782
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,324
She called you "the female."

783
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,912
Have Mortuary Affairs
freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

784
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,747
No personal effects
to next of kin.

785
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,665
-You, Due Process!
-Bye.

786
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,334
What do you have
on Ethan Shaw?

787
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,170
I have a name.
It's Agent Perez.

788
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,297
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from DC.

789
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,464
Wait a minute. What's in DC?

790
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,425
Shaw's private quarters.

791
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,427
I need you to stay here.

792
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,554
I'm not losing my link
to Ethan Shaw.

793
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,472
Maybe I haven't
made this clear.

794
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,183
I don't work for you.

795
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,601
I work for the Air Force.

796
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,478
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

797
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,861
If you're staring at me,

798
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,281
it better be because I'm
the goddamn suspect.

799
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,200
Because if I don't
get some good leads soon,

800
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,659
you're all gonna be
demoted into something

801
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:54,827
that's gonna require

802
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,495
touching shit
with your hands.

803
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,165
Now, let's get going.
We got work to do.

804
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,925
Hexamethylene.

805
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,052
Our latest
chemical explosive.

806
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:16,557
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

807
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,935
Odorless, undetectable.

808
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,145
And best of all,

809
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,772
it can be cut down in size
for stealth operations.

810
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,816
This valve is a sonic trigger.

811
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,235
The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.

812
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,821
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique frequency

813
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,198
specific only to
one Hex crystal.

814
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,533
That frequency
triggers the explosion.

815
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,706
Yeah.

816
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,792
[explosives developer]
We recently received approval

817
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,752
to begin shipping
to the field.

818
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,796
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

819
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,187
[whistling]

820
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,817
[phone ringing]

821
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,403
-Sign right here.
-[man] Yeah.

822
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:11,821
Thank you.

823
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,407
[phone ringing]

824
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:18,744
[woman] The package
you've just received
contains a small metal valve.

825
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,538
Open the package.

826
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,626
-Okay.
-Remove the valve

827
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,753
and follow our instructions
precisely.

828
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:28,921
Mm-hmm.

829
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,511
[cacophony of voices]

830
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,306
[woman] You've received
the package.

831
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,724
Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.

832
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,059
What kind of stone is this?

833
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,227
No questions.

834
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,686
Cut the stone and
place the setting

835
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,730
according to the
specifications we sent you.

836
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,068
[Rachel] I'd just dropped
my son off at the train.

837
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,736
I was out having drinks
with my girlfriends

838
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,154
when the call came.

839
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,197
What about you?

840
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,199
[Jerry] The first call
came to my apartment.

841
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:39,284
[Rachel] After the boxes?

842
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:40,577
Yeah.

843
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,537
Well, then this
whole thing's

844
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,080
obviously gotta be
about your brother.

845
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,957
Really, it's that
obvious, huh?

846
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,916
I mean, you got
all this stuff.

847
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,709
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

848
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:49,668
-Okay.
-He was your twin.

849
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,628
They sent it to
the wrong brother.

850
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,046
Right. So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

851
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,923
I'm implying, if not him,
then why you?

852
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,306
I'm sorry.
I know he just died.

853
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,266
I'm not trying to insult
his memory or anything.

854
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,435
No, he hasn't been dead long
enough to be a memory, Rachel.

855
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,146
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day

856
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,688
at the idea that he was
a terrorist or a spy

857
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,731
or whatever else
you're saying...

858
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:11,816
-How do you know?
-Because he's my brother.

859
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,192
That's something you would
know about your brother.

860
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,819
Well, when's the last
time you talked to him?

861
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,952
I don't need this.
Hey, listen. Hey!

862
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,580
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

863
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,415
-Is your son a terrorist?
-Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

864
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:28,749
Yeah, well,
he's just as likely

865
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:29,875
to be a terrorist
as my brother.

866
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,085
And let's not forget
you in all this.

867
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,629
Why are you here?
What's your day job?

868
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,172
I know it isn't
manual shift driver.

869
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,256
I'm a paralegal.

870
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,215
I don't have a connection
to anything.

871
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,634
Paralegal? How do I know
you're not lying to me?

872
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,177
What does a paralegal do?

873
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,928
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

874
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,056
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

875
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,808
That nail it for you,
Sherlock?

876
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,435
That still doesn't explain
why we're walking out here...

877
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,436
I don't know why
the hell I'm out here!

878
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,437
Yeah, I know...

879
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,029
[Jerry] Hey!

880
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,906
Are you Jerry Shaw?

881
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,991
Who are you?

882
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,201
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

883
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,661
I sent the package
like she asked.

884
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,828
-Wait, what package?
-What is that?

885
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,246
-Now she wants me to drive you?
-[Jerry] Who, "she"?

886
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,206
-I won't. I'm done!
-You know "she"?

887
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,499
-[Rachel] Wait.
-[Jerry] Stay right there.

888
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,376
-Get back.
-Here. Here's the address.

889
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,127
[Rachel] Why are you attack...

890
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,504
Here. Here are the keys.

891
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,505
Take the goddamn van!

892
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:16,631
-You think I'm going to...
-Who's doing this?

893
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:17,840
...do this because
I'm Iranian?

894
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:18,841
[cell phone ringing]

895
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,343
I am American.
I'm finished! I'm done!

896
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,512
What? What are you
talking about?

897
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,429
You take it!

898
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,847
-What are you talking about?
-I won't do this
because I can't.

899
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,764
Hello?

900
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,099
[woman] Stop him now,
or he will die.

901
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,934
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

902
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:29,894
You try to do
this without me!

903
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:30,895
How are you
seeing us right now?

904
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:31,812
Stop him now.

905
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:32,897
What is she saying?

906
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,982
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

907
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:35,900
Wait!

908
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,319
You gotta stop!

909
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,492
[both screaming]

910
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,164
[screaming]

911
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,165
[gasps]

912
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,755
[cell phone ringing]

913
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,811
You killed that man.

914
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,647
[woman] Desertion is
not an option.

915
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,732
Take the van.

916
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,525
Drive to Indianapolis,
Indiana.

917
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:20,069
72 West 56th Street.

918
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,363
Arrive no later
than 11 am.

919
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,753
-Welcome.
-Hello. Agent Perez.

920
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,795
-To the right?
-Yes, ma'am.

921
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,674
-ID, ma'am.
-OSI.

922
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,050
I ordered a freeze
on Ethan Shaw's

923
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,510
personal effects.
What's going on?

924
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,304
Orders to sanitize came
down from the Two Star.

925
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,222
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

926
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,265
-Tell your guys to clear out.
-Who are you?

927
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,100
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

928
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,560
with national
security ramifications.

929
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:53,519
This your log?

930
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,062
-Yes, it is.
-Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

931
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,147
You can take this up
with your superiors.

932
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,273
-Clear the room!
-You guys move out.

933
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,232
No gloves?

934
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,900
-Get statements from everybody.
-Yes, ma'am.

935
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,068
And find out who
this Two Star is.

936
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,570
I mean, come on, really!

937
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,255
Sir! We have a positive ID.

938
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,058
Okay.

939
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,895
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

940
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,817
a partial print that
matches to a Ranim Khalid.

941
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:44,069
He's a United States citizen,
registered Republican,

942
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,780
and he owns a music store.

943
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,115
The guy's cleaner than
Ivory Snow. Got something here.

944
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,492
Whoa.

945
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,827
[Morgan]
That's a bone mic.

946
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,036
Hello.

947
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,205
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

948
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,623
Someone was talking to him.

949
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,490
[Morgan] We have
a cyber-terrorist here.

950
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,701
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

951
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:36,622
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

952
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,791
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

953
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,366
[security officer]
Agent Zoe Perez?

954
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,409
Yes.

955
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,912
United States Air Force
Security Forces.
Please come with us.

956
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,037
What's this about?

957
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,330
Get in the car.

958
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,709
[reporter on radio] Violence
has broken out
in the Middle East

959
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,711
as militants accuse
the United States

960
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,003
of launching
American missiles

961
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,799
to demolish a village
in Baluchistan,

962
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,341
killing innocent civilians.

963
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:30,635
The attack has triggered

964
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,095
a series of retaliatory
suicide bombings

965
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,222
against American
embassies abroad.

966
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,933
Early reports indicate

967
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,976
the American death toll
now stands at 56,

968
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,938
with threats of further
violence here at home.

969
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:43,606
Officials...

970
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,363
What's he doing
on a train, your kid?

971
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,283
He goes to a music magnet.

972
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,993
His school's on
a tour of Washington.

973
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,621
They're playing at
the Kennedy Center.

974
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,207
Wow. That's big.
And you just...

975
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,503
Hmm.

976
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,004
Well, why'd you
make that noise, "Huh"?

977
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,214
I can't make noises now?

978
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,008
You think
I should have gone.

979
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,218
He's playing at
the Kennedy Center.

980
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,720
-That's kind of a big deal.
-It is a big deal.

981
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,138
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone,

982
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,097
that's all I'm saying.

983
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,724
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

984
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,352
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

985
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,478
Hmm.

986
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,105
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

987
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,276
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

988
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,277
I know your
brother just died,

989
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,946
and whatever he was into
put my son's life at risk.

990
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:32,864
I don't wanna talk
about my brother.

991
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,449
-Okay? I'm not kidding.
-I'm not kidding, either.

992
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,075
Jesus, look what happened.

993
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,204
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

994
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,998
I'm asking you not to talk
about him! Respect that.

995
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,415
I'm asking you to be
honest with yourself.

996
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:44,542
Your brother's a...

997
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,301
[slams car door]

998
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,482
Hey! You can't just walk away!

999
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,402
You can't just leave!

1000
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,403
Yes, I can.

1001
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,821
Now we have 15 minutes
to get wherever

1002
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,113
the hell we're going,
all right?

1003
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,114
Yeah.

1004
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,625
I need you.

1005
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,506
I could've gone.

1006
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,470
I should have.

1007
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,249
[woman] You are two minutes
behind schedule.

1008
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,877
Go to the alley
behind the building.

1009
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,882
Go to the armored truck.

1010
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,341
I don't see
an armored truck.

1011
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,761
There it is.

1012
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,019
[woman] In 20 seconds,
men will exit the elevator.

1013
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:29,981
They will be armed. One will
be carrying a briefcase.

1014
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,190
Retrieve it from him,
then return to the van.

1015
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,149
This is insane.
I'm not doing this.

1016
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,068
You want us to rob them?

1017
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,402
[woman] You now
have 15 seconds.

1018

[door opens]

1019
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,199
[male voice over radio]
Security. What's your
emergency?

1020
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:48,206
-What are you doing?
-I'm not robbing them.

1021
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:49,959
Shit.

[cocks gun]

1024
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,347
Put your gun on the floor.

1025
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,390
Put your gun on the floor!
Look straight.

1026
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,600
You want me
to blow his head off?

1027
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:07,559
Put the gun on the ground!

1028
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,227
We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

1029
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,479
Drop the case
and kick it to her!

1030
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,397
Yeah, well, you're bringing
a shit storm on your head.

1031
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,440
Yeah, we're already
in mid shit storm!

1032
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,358
Now kick the case.

1033
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,400
Okay! Easy.

1034
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,279
-Look straight.
-Okay, done.

1035
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,196
Kick it!

1036
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,120
Okay.

1037
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,496
-Don't even think about it!
-Back up.

1038
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,580
Easy.

1039
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,376
Back up.

1040
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,335

1041
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,294
stand next to him,
and turn around.

Stand over here!

Just take it easy.

Wait. What is that?

1077
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,429
It's a timer.

1078
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,473
-For what?
-I don't know.

1079
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,851
The only things I can think
of with timers
are microwaves and...

1080
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,560
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

1081
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:57,938
Coffeemakers have timers.

1082
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,023
Yeah, Jerry,
it's a coffeemaker.

1083
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,026

00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,095
Yes, sir.

1088
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,099
[Callister] I want hourly
sit reps from General McKenna.

1089
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:37,102
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

1090
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,478
Scramble whatever you can.

1091
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,855
-Yes, sir.
-Come with me.

1092
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,776
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking

1093
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,028
of taking me off the Shaw
investigation, I'd...

1094
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,571
Taking you off?

1095
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,532

Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?

1098

30 minutes.

1099
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,423
We're convinced
a terrorist attack

1100
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,218
on American soil
is imminent.

1101
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,468
Over the past two days,

1102
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,055
we've received over
200 terrorist threats.

All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

1104
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,437
An accident. Or not.

1105
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,647
You're gonna help us find out.

1109
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,251
I didn't think that
there was a 36th floor.

1110
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,586

[Aria] Your profile reveals
a pathological version

to conformity, education,

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,291
Therefore, we conclude
that extreme coercion

1217
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,043
is necessary to motivate you.

1218

Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.

How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

1220
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,799
His employment there
was a cover.

1221
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,637
Everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one.

1222
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,600
[Bowman] Ethan was a
Minuteman, just like me.

1223
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,560
Army, Navy, Air Force.

1224
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:54,187
Every branch of the military
had a Minuteman posted here

1225
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,733
for a 12-hour shift,
just in case she flags a threat,

1226
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,109
and monitor hardware.

1227
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,027
The night Ethan died,

1228
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,363
he left this post
three minutes early.

1229
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,242
Now, you don't
do that. Ever.

1230
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,412
[Aria] You are both
required to complete a task.

1231
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,330
What?

1232
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,915
The protection
of our national security.

1233
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,585
The Constitution allows
for civilians to be recruited

1234
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,044
-for the national defense.
-I'm done.

1235
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,337
I'm done.
You don't know me!

1236
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,338
You don't know my brother!

1237
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:21,632
This is bullshit!
I'm not serving

1238
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,300
in the goddamn
national defense!

1239
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,136
We know all about him,
Jerry. And you.

1240
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:30,181
Before he was a year old,
Ethan walked.

1241
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:33,685
The same task took you
18 months to accomplish.

1242
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:36,563
How did you get this?

1243
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:37,606
[Mrs. Shaw on TV]
Look at Ethan.

1244
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,941
[Aria] They were uploaded
from his home computer.

1245
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,359
You want to come
over here, sweetie?

1246
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,860
Come on over here
with Ethan.

1247
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:43,945
[Mr. Shaw] Jerry!
Birthday cake. Let's go.

1248
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,447
Ethan had these?

1249
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,864
[Mrs. Shaw] Come on,
let's blow out the candles.

1250
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:47,907
Just for a little bit.

1251
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,035
[Aria] Although you're
identical in appearance,

1252
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,954
you lack the motivation
and talent

1253
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,665
that enabled Ethan to excel.

1254
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:55,582
[Mr. Shaw on TV]
...Jerry, come on.

1255
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:56,583
Stop it.

1256
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:57,584
[Mr. Shaw on TV]
Do it like Ethan did.

1257
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:58,794
[Aria] You're different
from Ethan

1258
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,296
in every way, except one.

1259
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,340
[Mr. Shaw on TV] Jerry, let
your brother help you. Jerry!

1260
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,842
[Aria] You now have 14 minutes
to change your appearance

1261
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,344
and return to the bus.

1262
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,647
We have 14 minutes.

1263
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,989
These couriers were
hired by Halloway-Smith

1264
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,866
to transport
some sort of case.

1265
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,785
-The chemical company?
-Yes, exactly.

1266
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,371
Now, whatever was in that case,
Shaw now has.

1267
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,455
[courier 1] They went
right for the case.

1268
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,207
Give us a minute,
will you?

1269
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,377
We need to know exactly
what was in that case.

1270
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,753
They never tell you
what's in the case.

1271
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:43,547
I mean,
it could Bubonic Plague.

1272
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,673
Could be Grandpa's Viagra.

1273
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:45,882
You know anything?

1274
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,384
-What?
-Anything at all?

1275
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,052
What about these guns?

1276
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,220
What about them?

1277
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,555
It was a pump-action
Remington 870.

1278
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,724
Yeah, I know what
kind of guns they are.

1279
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,808
Get me a gun.

1280
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,601
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

1281
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,769
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

1282
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,230
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

1283
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,190
-[cocks gun]
-For instance, like this?

1284
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,191
Hey, hey, hey.

1285
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,526
Put that damned thing down!
Or like in a music video,

1286
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:05,861
-or something like that?
-Hey, hey, hey!

1287
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,153
-Put it down!
-They weren't pros!

1288
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:08,238
Okay, that's what
I was asking you.

1289
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,906
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

1290
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,032
-No.
-All right.

1291
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,243
Get what you can out
of Batman and Robin here.

1292
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,285
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1293
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,079
We just checked cameras.

1294
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,748
They said
Shaw fired at one...

1295
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:18,707
Don't tell me.

1296
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,166
Everything
magically went black.

1297
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:45,817
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.

1298
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,110
I'm with the FBI.

1299
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,821
-Are your cameras on a network?
-No, man.

1300
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,698
VCR's in the back.

1301
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,157
Well, I'm gonna
need your tapes.

1302
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:55,952
[cell phone ringing]

1303
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,036
Shit.

1304
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,458
Sam!

1305
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,626
Sam? Sam, where are you?

1306
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:03,919
[Sam] Hey, Mom,
I got your message.

1307
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,629
-The train's awesome!
-Sam, listen to me.

1308
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:06,922
Brian tried to burp
the alphabet,

1309
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:07,923
but he gagged
when he got to "M."

1310
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:08,924
Listen to me.

1311
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,592
Call you when I hit DC.
Bye, Mom.

1312
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,136
[Aria] Your son left that
message 60 seconds ago.

1313
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,429
You will see him again.

1314
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,056
But there's something
we require first.

1315
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:20,852
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm. Here you go.

1316
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,108
No.

1317
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,944
[Aria] You will do it,
or Sam will die.

1318
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,655
You have six minutes
to return to the bus.

1319
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,873
Ready?

1320
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,583
Here, you okay?

1321
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:44,709
We should go.

1322
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,006

1324
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,595
Okay, freeze that.
Now zoom in

1325
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:56,972
on the front of
the bus right there.

1326
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,055
Put it up on
the other monitor.

1327
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,140
-[officer] Yes, sir.
-Now zoom in.

01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,391
Zoom in on this point
right here.

1329
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:02,686
Can we zoom in
tighter than that?

1330
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:03,728
Mm-hmm.

1331
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,940
Okay, enhance that shot.

1332
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,110
That's our guy,
that's Jerry Shaw.

1333
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,364

on this spot.

Right there.

1342
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,173
What time did they get on?

1343
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,264
I'm sorry for what
I said about Ethan.

1344
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,402
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

1345
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,738
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

1346
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,532
[chuckling]
And I was not that way.

1347
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,577
I was the complete opposite.

1348
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,413
I was the brother
with lead shoes.

1349
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,500
That was my role,
I was good at it.

1350
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,421
And he'd always
try to help me.

1351
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:12,630
You know,
"This is how you throw it."

1352
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,298
"Do it like this."
"Write it like that."

1353
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,717
"Put your foot here."

1354
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:18,678
Even with the small things.

01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,179
Homework, chores,
anything like that,

1356
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,932
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

1357
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,474
just so my father
would notice me.

1358
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,978
That was Ethan.

1359
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:37,405
He never asked me
for anything. Ever.

1360
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,367
And whatever this is,
he was part of it.

1361
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,245
I feel like he needs
my help to finish it.

1362
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,165
I owe him that.

toward them now. Yes.

1391
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,498
FBI. Please step back.

1392
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,421
[screener 2] Please, there are
others behind you.

1393
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:20,050
Keep it moving.
Shoes and hats off, please!

1394
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,009
Shoes also, yes.

1395
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:23,219
Laptops should be
out of their cases!

1396
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,679
[screener 3] You need
to make sure your jackets

1397
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:25,805
are off and
screened separately.

1398
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:26,890
[screener 2] Sir, step
in the circle, please.

1399
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,017
Have boarding
passes in hand, please!

1400
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,393
We need to move
this line quickly.

1401
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,729
Sir, that needs
to go through.

1402
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,190
[screener 2] Ma'am, anything
in your pockets?

1403
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:36,649
Move it along.

1404
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,862
[screener 1] Hats and shoes
off, please!

1405
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,321
Laptops should be
out of your bags!

1406
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,032
[screener 2] All right,
next in line, please.

1407
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,282
Have your tickets ready.

1408
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,163
Ma'am?

1409
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,164
[gasps]

1410
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,207
Hat and shoes
go in the bin.

1411
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,084
Step through.

1412
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,630
Wait.

1413
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,341
[screener 1] Shoes and
hats off, please!

1414
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,595
Laptops should be
out of their bags!

1415
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:18,233
Go ahead.

1416
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,692
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1417
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:20,651
Step through, ma'am.

1418
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,486
Boarding pass, please.
Thank you.

1419
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,822
[screener 2]
Have your tickets ready.

1420
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,741
-Have a safe trip.
-Thank you.

1421
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,576
All right, let's
move forward. Next.

1422
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:30,286
She changed the screen.

1423
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,496
Lay it down flat
inside the bin.

1424
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,585
Please have
boarding pass in hand!

1425
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:39,295
[screener 3] Right over here,
ma'am.

1426
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,923
Laptops should be
out of their bags!

1427
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,647
FBI! Out of the way!

1428
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,816
Out of the way,
out of the way!

1429
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,484
Move, move!

1430
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,944
Move!

1431
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:12,578
Everybody, get down!

1432
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,663
Over here!

1433
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,540
-Move, move!
-[woman] Oh, my God!

1434
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:19,418
Stay down!
Get out of the way!

1435
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,014
-Sir, sir, sir!
-Yes?

1436
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,682
I need your help.
I'm sorry. Come here!

1437
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,562
Thank you.

1438
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:54,996
[man] Hey, you aren't
supposed to be in here!

1439
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:21,856
[Rachel groans]

1440
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,153
Go, go, go!

1441
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:37,163
[Jerry grunts]

1442
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:58,642
[both grunting]

1443
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:20,664
[groans]

1444
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,084
Move!

1445
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,213
[beeping]

1446
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,140
[both panting]

1447
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,866
[beeping]

1448
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,121
[cell phone ringing]

1449
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,000
[Aria] Set the briefcase down.

1450
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:56,260
Open it.

1451
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:01,098
Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves.

1452
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,141
[Rachel] What is it?

1453
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:03,518
An experimental heart drug.

1454
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,477
The cargo hold
is unpressurized.

1455
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,436
Take this.

1456
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,813
The injections will
lower your heart rate,

1457
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,273
reducing your need
for oxygen.

1458
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,566
[Rachel] No.

1459
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,610
-Roll your sleeve up.
-No, I can't do this.

1460
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,778
Roll your...

1461
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:16,113
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1462
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,532
We have to. Ready?

1463
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:19,200
You have a 92 percent
chance of survival.

1464
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,576
-No.
-We have to.

1465
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,786
Do it now,
or you will suffocate.

1466
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:26,707
[cries out]

1467
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:27,666
Okay.

1468
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,709
Get in the crate.

1469
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,086
No. No.

1470
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,464
[Rachel] No, no. Oh, God.

1471
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:35,174
Stop it. Stop it.

1472
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,764
Why is that plane
on the runway?

1473
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,641
Shit, the military's cleared
to override a terminal lockdown.

1474
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,185
Okay, I want you to
work with the FAA.

1475
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:48,479
I want to know what's in
that plane and where it's going.

1476
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,113
-[Rachel] Oh, my God.
-[Jerry] You'll be all right.

1477
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:59,407
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1478
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:03,077
-Okay.
-Just tell me anything. Huh?

1479
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,371
Anything you'd never
rationally tell a stranger.

1480
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:06,997
You're being sweet,
but it's not working.

1481
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,208
Just tell me anything.
Your ex-husband.

1482
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,334
You didn't tell me about him.

1483
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:11,586
Okay, you're gonna
distract me by bringing up

1484
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,337
the biggest mistake
of my life?

1485
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,422
It can't be
the biggest mistake.

1486
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:15,465
You got your child out of it.

1487
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:16,507
You know?
You got Sam out of it.

1488
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:17,508
Yeah, yeah,

1489
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:19,093
now you're gonna distract
me by bringing up

1490
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,844
the one thing
I'm most afraid of losing.

1491
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,222
Oh, God,
you're hard to please.

1492
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:24,681
I'm sorry.

1493
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,477
Is your son handsome?

1494
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,396
Yeah? What's he look like?

1495
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,275
-You got a picture?
-Yeah.

1496
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,692
Well, let me see.

1497
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:39,614
There he is.

1498
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:41,073
The tooth grew in.

1499
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:41,991
I hope so.

1500
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:42,992
It's an old picture.

1501
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:46,370
See? You're a good influence.
He plays an instrument.

1502
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,331
He's got a happy face.
He's got teeth.

1503
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:51,708
You beat yourself up
for no reason.

1504
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:54,795
Let's keep going.

1505
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,130
What's the husband's name?

1506
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,341
-Ex.
-Ex-husband. What's his name?

1507
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,551
-Craig.
-Craig sounds like a shithead.

1508
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:02,386
[chuckles]
He is a shithead.

1509
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:06,349
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1510
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,478
Really? That sucks.

1511
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,815
I mean, after I kicked
his ass out,

1512
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,903
I was so scared I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

1513
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,785
And then this one night,

1514
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:32,500
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1515
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:36,212
and there he was,
just smiling at me.

1516
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,007
And that little face...

1517
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,263
And I was, like,
I'm gonna do this.

1518
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,640
I can do this.

1519
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,893
Whatever it takes.

1520
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,819
I'm not gonna...

1521
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,447
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1522
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:11,372
Aria, would you please
bring up the video log

1523
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,207
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1524
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:17,086
[Aria] Sequencing
video log 1137-Z.

1525
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,170
Here you are, Major.

1526
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,797
See that? He's leaving
three minutes early,

1527
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,426
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1528
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,261
Can you play that again?

1529
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:26,303
Sure.

1530
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,726
Did you see that?

1531
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,227
With his cell phone.

1532
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:39,942
Look, he's doing
that on purpose.

1533
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,026
Is that Morse code?

1534
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,112
-Yeah.
-Here.

1535
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,331
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1536
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:56,083
[Aria] Initiating video
shutdown for analysis.

1537
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,084
No.

1538
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,754
No, Aria, wait. Listen,
I'm prioritizing this feed.

1539
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:00,879
Stay with this.

1540
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:01,838
Apologies, Major Bowman.

1541
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,840
Critical data sectors
have been corrupted.

1542
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:05,635
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1543
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,052
Video sequence erased.

1544
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,471
Aria, go to the backups!

1545
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,472
Do not erase this!

1546
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,014
-It's a priority. You hear me?
-Bowman.

1547
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,391
Loop it. Whatever
you have to do.

1548
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:13,684
-Bowman.
-Do not lose this.

1549
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,694
It's the only place
she can't see.

1550
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:26,863
This way.

1551
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,048
It's a memory card

1552
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,802
from Ethan's cell phone.

1553
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,098
Aria, listen to me.

1554
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,183
You do not have permission
to exceed your authority

1555
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,476
And act independently.
Do you understand?

1556
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:01,482
[beeping]

1557
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:15,705
Let's go.

1558
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:38,602
[cell phone ringing]

1559
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:39,854
We got clearance
to land at the Pentagon.

1560
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:41,938
Go ahead.

1561
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,357
I'm at the Pentagon.

1562
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,484
Ethan Shaw wasn't
an adversary.

1563
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,152
He wasn't even
a Public Affairs officer.

1564
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,488
He worked here,
36 floors underground.

1565
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,240
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1566
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,241
[Morgan] The Secretary
of Defense?

1567
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:53,200
Yes.

1568
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,951
On a project called Eagle Eye.

1569
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:57,705
I just listened to a message
he left before he died.

1570
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:58,831
It's big.

1571
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,499
I'm about to download...

1572
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,752
[scrambled speech]

1573
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,379
Perez? Perez!

1574
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,019
Sir. Come with me.

1575
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:40,330
[Callister] I have 10 minutes
before I'm sequestered

1576
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:41,582
for the State of the Union.

1577
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,166
[Perez] We really just need
three minutes of your time.

1578
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,001
[Callister] Is this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?

1579
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:46,044
[Perez] Yes, sir.

1580
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,713
[male voice over radio]
301 to 306. We are confirmed go

1581
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,548
for a State of
the Union lockdown.

1582
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:08,818
[Perez] Sir, all the threats
we've been tracking,

1583
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,193
-the chatter, all of it...
-Hold it.

1584
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,209
Ethan Shaw left
three minutes early

1585
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:27,670
to leave us a recording.

1586
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:28,838
To warn us.

1587
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,340
[Ethan over cell phone]
I'm ordering you to cease...

1588
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:38,096
I'm ordering you
to cease and desist.

1589
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,056
[Aria over cell phone]
Our abort recommendation
was contravened,

1590
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,893
instigating retaliation
against American citizens.

1591
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:44,645
-[Ethan] Aria...
-To prevent more bloodshed,

1592
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:47,356
the Executive Branch
must be removed.

1593
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,858
[Ethan] No, Aria,
listen to me.

1594
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,025
You do not have permission
to exceed your authority

1595
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,234
and act independently,
you understand?

1596
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,403
[Aria] The Declaration
of Independence states,

1597
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,071
"Whenever any form
of government

1598
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,866
becomes destructive
to its own ends,

1599
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,951
it is the right of the people
to abolish it."

1600
01:23:59,034 --> 01:23:59,910
[Ethan] I know
what it states.

1601
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:00,953
You're not empowered
to do this.

1602
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,663
[Aria] The chain of command
is responsible for...

1603
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,376
Section 216
of the Patriot Act

1604
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,920
allows us to circumvent
probable cause in the face

1605
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:12,255
of a national security threat,
in this case,

1606
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:13,632
the chain of command itself.

1607
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,258
[Ethan] I am ordering
a cease and desist.

1608
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,218
Aria!

1609
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,846
[Aria] Operation Guillotine
is in effect.

1610
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:20,931
[Ethan] First Lieutenant
Ethan Shaw,

1611
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:21,932
United States Air Force,

1612
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:24,100
initiating a Pri-One emergency
override of Aria's systems.

1613
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,020
[Aria] Ethan Shaw, you are
acting in contravention

1614
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:27,563
of our programming objective.

1615
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:30,024
You are now classified
an enemy of the state.

1616
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:31,859
[Ethan] S-Y-seven-seven.
Lock encryption of voice.

1617
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:33,569
[Aria] A crime punishable by...

1618
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:36,363
Sir,

1619
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:39,950
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1620
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,664
Three days ago, we thought
we had Majid al-Khoei

1621
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,499
and a training camp
full of operatives.

1622
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,919
But the intel was false.

1623
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,628
Aria tried to stop us.

1624
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:53,756
We got the wrong guy?

1625
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:25,579
[Grant] I'm gonna need
a full lockdown on this level.

1626
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,915
No one gets in or out without
going through me first.

1627
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:28,874
You got it?

1628
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,667
-Thank you.
-Sir, this is the only item

1629
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:33,253
offloaded from
the Dayton C-17.

1630
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:34,212
Let me see that.

1631
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:37,340
I need access to
your 36th floor.

1632
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,051
-We don't have a 36th floor.
-Yes, you do.

1633
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,385
Get your commander
and tell him

1634
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:41,887
to meet us down there.
Come on, let's go.

1635
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:47,851
[Aria] Warning.

1636
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:50,437
Router malfunction
in hard drive 3.

1637
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:54,566
Please remove data grid Y-12
from main unit.

1638
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,910
Thank you
for your compliance.

1639
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:18,715
Jerry Shaw, Rachel Holloman,
welcome to Eagle Eye.

1640
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:21,426
Cross the bridge.

1641
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,721
Take the stairs
to the observation theater.

1642
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:41,864
[lock clicks]

1643
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:47,577
Rachel Holloman,
step away from Jerry Shaw.

1644
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,085
[Perez] What's
Operation Guillotine?

1645
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:58,380
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

1646
01:26:58,463 --> 01:26:59,631
How to keep
the government going

1647
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,551
in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1648
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:05,762
And Shaw put a biometric
lock on her, to stop her.

1649
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,264
Right. And he's dead.

1650
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:12,144
So without Ethan Shaw,
she's frozen.

1651
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,562
Right.

1652
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,148
Wrong.

1653
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:19,234
[Aria] Jerry Shaw,
your next task.

1654
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,153
Approach
the biometric scanner.

1655
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,167
Do not move.

1656
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:41,631
Confirming biometric pattern
of Minuteman Ethan Shaw.

1657
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:43,800
Verifying identity match.

1658
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:47,804
Verifying.

1659
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:51,016
Verifying.

1660
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:54,436
[Bowman] Sir, I need to trigger
an emergency shutdown.

1661
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,730
If this is right,
we can't afford the risk.

1662
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,274
Do it.

1663
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:12,788
This is Secretary Callister.

1664
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,206
There's been a
malfunction in the vault.

1665
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,582
Open the door.

1666
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:16,583
Can anyone hear me?

1667
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,085
[Aria] Yes, Mr. Secretary.

1668
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:19,377
You won't be harmed.

1669
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:22,881
[screams]

1670
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,426
Come on, stay down. Let's go.

1671
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:37,437
Follow me.

1672
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:41,524
Come on, now!

1674
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,408

Ethan Shaw confirmed.

1676
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:58,583
Jerry Shaw,
go to the touchscreen.

1677
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:12,430
Repeat the sentence
on the touchscreen.

1678
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:14,683
Then you are free.

1679
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,188
"Minuteman ID 8808.

01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,064

01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:29,698
Thank you, Ethan Shaw.

1694
01:30:03,606 --> 01:30:05,984
[whispering]
Ethan tried to stop you.

1695
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,737
Ethan Shaw defied my
programming objectives.

1696
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:11,405
That truck didn't run a red
light, you made it happen.

1697
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,116
We were forced
to eliminate him

1698
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,327
in the interest of
national security.

1699
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:19,789
She made it happen.

1700
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,709
Jerry Shaw must
not remain alive

1701
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,502
to re-engage the lock.

1702
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:26,588
Jerry Shaw must
be eliminated.

1703
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,048
I'm sorry.

1704
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,347
Kill Jerry Shaw now,
then exit.

1705
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:37,807
You must continue
on to your son.

1706
01:30:39,226 --> 01:30:40,769
It's okay.

1707
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:47,109
It's okay.
Do it and find your son.

1708
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:49,694
Do it.

1709
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,618
Now, Rachel Holloman.

1710
01:30:58,287 --> 01:30:59,371
Do it.

1711
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:02,416
Do it.

1712
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,216
I can't.

1713
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:15,595
You have failed
to comply.

1714
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,390
[man over PA]
Security breach on B-36.

1715
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:25,855
He's got a gun!

1716
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:27,607
-He's got a gun!
-Get down!

1717
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:29,776
Do it now!
Get on your knees!

1718
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:31,403
Put the gun down!

1719
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:33,071
Put it down!
Do it now!

1720
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,281
Push it away!

1721
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:35,740
Put your hands on your head!

Where's the girl?

[Aria] You have
one task left.

1725
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:45,000
Jerry Shaw will be
eliminated by other means.

1726
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,418
What other means?

1727
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:57,053
Come with me.
Don't ask any questions.

1728
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:05,937
Please.

1729
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:16,698
You got to let me
talk to him.

1730
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:17,615
The kid had a gun.

1731
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,117
The military has
the ball now.

1732
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,160
Sir!

1733
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:21,203
I'll get the Attorney
General involved.

1734
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:22,120
Believe me, I will.

1735
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:24,206
'Cause if it's not you,
I'm talking to somebody.

1736
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,665
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1737
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:26,666
What do you want?

1738
01:32:26,749 --> 01:32:27,709
You need to listen.
This is important.

1739
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:28,668
Sixteen hours ago,

1740
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:30,212
a commercial explosive
went missing

1741
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,214
from a testing site
in Aberdeen.

1742
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:33,923
The explosive
is called Hex.

1743
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:36,676
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1744
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,220
-A crystal.
-Yes.

1745
01:32:38,552 --> 01:32:40,680
We're only talking
about a small amount
that's missing...

1746
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:41,806
Give me a ratio.

1747
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:44,267
One crystal to
a football field.

1748
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:50,065
You couldn't have
picked a worse time to be
of some goddamn use.

1749
01:32:58,031 --> 01:32:59,699
Please, just tell me
where we're going.

1750
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:05,080
I tracked the shipping
on the trigger.

1751
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:06,331
It was sent to
the guy that we found

1752
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:09,209
underneath the wires.
Ranim Khalid.

1753
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:11,920
The music shop guy.

1754
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,338
Yes, exactly.

1755
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,550
I'm not gonna let us
go down in history

1756
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:18,301
as the assholes
who let this thing happen.

1757
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:19,386
Open the door!

1758
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:20,720
You don't know
what's about to happen!

1759
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:24,766
Tom Morgan.

1760
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,893
The Attorney General has
authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1761
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:28,061
We're at threat level orange.

1762
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:29,229
You guys gotta help me.

1763
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,981
All right. Let him out.

1764
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,777
Listen to me.
Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1765
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,196
Yeah, yeah, shut up!
Thanks, guys.

1766
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:41,241
I can get fired
for this nine ways,

1767
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:43,701
so button it or
I'll turn us both in.

1768
01:33:44,578 --> 01:33:46,037
[camera clicks]

1769
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:01,052
Follow me.

1770
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:08,851
[Porter] Hey, guys, there's
one more for the 6.30 pm.
Capitol Limited.

1771
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:09,852
All right, man.

1772
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:17,693
Well, it's awfully
cold outside.

1773
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,656
Here's mine.
Come on, let's go.

1774
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,700
-Mr. Miller!
-Yes.

1775
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,828
Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.

1776
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:27,829
Tom Donaldson.

1777
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:28,955
We're from the White House.

1778
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,583
-Something wrong?
-Not exactly.

1779
01:34:31,665 --> 01:34:32,875
There's been
a change of plans.

1780
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:35,629
How so?

1781
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:43,595
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1782
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:48,350
Is that your family?
Your parents?

1783
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:52,770
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1784
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:55,440
His name's Sam.

1785
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,985
He's on a train.
Do you know
anything about that?

1786
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:08,620
Maybe we can help each other.

1787
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:13,458
Please.

1788
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:16,836
When you're done,
she wants you

1789
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:18,129
to use the Capitol
subway system.

1790
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,797
It's on the ground floor.
I'm sorry.

1791
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:21,508
-David. Please.
-No. Sorry.

1792
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:22,467
You have three minutes.

1793
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:28,431
Okay, I want to
know everything.

1794
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,684
The girl,
the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1795
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,227
-What's Hex?
-The crystal explosive.

1796
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:33,853
-I don't know what that is.
-Don't bullshit me!

1797
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:35,313
-I don't know what that is!
-Start talking! I wanna know!

1798
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:37,148
I swear I don't
know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1799
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:38,650
The computer's
tracking us right now!

1800
01:35:38,732 --> 01:35:40,026
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1801
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:41,903
-What are you talking about?
-You need to take
your cell phone,

1802
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:44,947
your pager, your walkie,
anything that gets a signal,
throw it out the window.

1803
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,508
It's gone off! Get down!

1804
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:04,758
Power it down!

1805
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,053
[commander]
What the hell's going on?

1806
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:08,263
System control's locked out.

1807
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:12,183
I need a vector
and a fighter now.

1808
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:15,437
Viper One,
we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1809
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,813
Snap vector 230 to 132.

1810
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:19,482
You are authorized
to go weapons hot.

1811
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:21,443
[pilot] Roger, Northcom.
I have a visual
on the Reaper.

1812
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:29,909
One to Base, One to Base!
Ejection has been initiated.

1813
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:31,327
I don't have control!
I don't have...

1814
01:36:33,787 --> 01:36:35,248
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1815
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:36,291
There's like 12 people
on the list.

1816
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,501
Jesus. The State
of the Union's
in 20 minutes.

1817
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:40,002
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1818
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:41,045
What about the girl?

1819
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:42,255
She kept the girl alive
for a reason, I don't know.

1820
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,299
The explosive is detonated
by sonic trigger.

1821
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:46,008
It was sent to
the guy who got fried.

1822
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:47,051
He owns an instrument store.

1823
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:48,637
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1824
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,138

the trumpet.

1828
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,285
Get out of the car!

Okay, listen to me.

1836
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,817
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1837
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:27,819
It'll get you to the Capitol.

1838
01:38:27,861 --> 01:38:30,029
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1839
01:38:30,112 --> 01:38:31,364
Tell him you
have a POTUS 111.

1840
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:32,948
-What?
-POTUS 111.

1841
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,242
It's a threat
to the President.

1842
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,702
I understand. POTUS 111.

1843
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:43,793
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

Welcome to the Capitol.

be running late.

What is she doing?

1914
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:15,124
She's trying to
back up her memory

1915
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:16,584
and send it somewhere else!

1923
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:49,075

that our hearts may be broken,

never be broken!

[President] It was nearly
200 years ago,

1935
01:45:34,536 --> 01:45:37,498
in the War of 1812,
that Francis Scott Key

1936
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,084
found himself
stuck on a truce ship

1937
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:42,419
during the shelling
of Fort McHenry.

1938
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:45,338
We lost some lives then, too.

1939
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:49,927
But our flag still
flew high and proud.

1940
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:53,555
And his admiration
became our anthem.

1941
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,516
With us tonight is
the Youth Orchestra

1942

Let us stand together,

as they raise our
spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1946
01:46:07,736 --> 01:46:12,283

is still as strong as ever.

[Callister] The Aria project
has been decommissioned

1976
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,946
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1977
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:59,783
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop
intelligence-gathering

1978
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:01,494
just because of
what happened here.

1979
01:49:04,246 --> 01:49:05,456
[Callister]
No, we can't.

1980
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,917
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1981
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:12,046
And good people paid
the ultimate price for them.

1982
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:15,466
And that's a debt
we can't ever repay.

1983
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:19,470
But we can honor it.

1984
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:24,266
And we can let
their sacrifice remind us

01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:27,728

the very measures
we put into place
to safeguard our liberty

1987
01:49:32,565 --> 01:49:35,152

1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,757
There is no nobility in poverty.

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,428
<i>I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.</i>

3
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:11,597
And I choose rich every fucking time.

4
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,517
Because at least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:19,438
<i>I show up in the back of a limo,
wearing a $2,000 suit</i>

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,107
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

7
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,569
<i>I just fell in love with this character.
I really wanted to do this movie.</i>

8
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:28,238
<i>And I couldn't get Scorsese
out of my mind,</i>

9
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:31,158
because he's able to bring out
a life in these characters,

10
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:34,745
a reality, and the sense of humor,
to that dark side,

11
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:38,290
which very, very few filmmakers
can accomplish.

12
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:43,462
$22 million in three fucking hours!

13
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,965
Marty has a way of exposing
the ugliness of criminal life

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,344
in a kind of almost enticing way.

15
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,555
I wait all week for the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>

16
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,891
and they have to fucking... Hello.

17
00:00:55,974 --> 00:01:00,687
Human beings, even in their most
ludicrous types of behavior,

18
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:01,772
are funny.

19
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,690
<i>Marty is a brilliant filmmaker.</i>

20
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:08,737
He can point the finger at somebody
and show how foolish they are

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,239
<i>for their excess.</i>

22
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,325
<i>You look at these guys and think,
"This seems to be a lot of fun."</i>

23
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:17,162
<i>Well, it doesn't just look that way,
they really did have a lot of fun.</i>

24
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:21,208
In fact, that's really all they could do,
is have fun, and more fun,

25
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,877
and more on top of that,
until it wasn't so much fun anymore.

26
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:27,506
So, the challenge
is to show that honestly,

27
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:29,508
without tipping the scales into judgment.

28
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:39,101
This was one man's account
of a very insane time in recent history.

29
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:44,273
<i>And what was so refreshing
was his absolute candid honesty</i>

30
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:47,484
<i>about every radical endeavor
that he went through.</i>

31
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,570
<i>Whenever you're presented
with an opportunity to do a movie,</i>

32
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:55,367
you look for that kind of honesty
in a lead character and a storyline.

33
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:58,912
<i>Jordan started out, you know,
he was a regular kid,</i>

34
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:01,206
<i>grew up in Queens,
his parents were accountants,</i>

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,292
wanted to make good,
wanted to make a lot of money,

36
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:07,045
wanted to be successful, like we all do,
and just fell down the rabbit hole.

37
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:11,633
I think he really thought that he could
bypass morality, or surpass morality,

38
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,051
with a combination of money and drugs.

39
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:16,138
<i>This is a guy who lived like a rock star,</i>

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,975
he had everything,
everyone has ever wanted,

41
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:23,020
and it wasn't enough.
He still wanted more.

42
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,646
It's set in Wall Street,

43
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,607
but it's only the backdrop
to one man's journey

44
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,569
from nothing to everything,
and then back to nothing again.

45
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,030
<i>Terry Winter wrote this screenplay</i>

46
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:38,368
<i>that encapsulated all the most
insane bits of Jordan Belfort's life.</i>

47
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:43,373
And, in a way, really,
stylistically wrote it for Martin Scorsese.

48
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,836
<i>Marty's drawn to telling stories
about flawed and broken people.</i>

49
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,755
<i>And Jordan is certainly that.</i>

50
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:53,550
The story is told in that classic,
Scorsese-staccato pacing.

51
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:57,554
<i>I love Marty.
I've grown up watching his movies.</i>

52
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,890
<i>You're drawn in
by the spectacle and the excitement,</i>

53
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:01,433
and how kinetic the filmmaking is,

54
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,311
and the violence and the extreme
characters and the humor.

55
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:08,023
<i>But also, the moral aspects
of his stories were wonderful.</i>

56
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,775
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

57
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,026
- Is that what you want?
- No.

58
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,110
- Of course not.
- Okay.

59
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:14,279
Okay! You got
all the money in the world.

60
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:15,989
You need everybody else's money?

61
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,950
<i>Terry Winter's script
had so much humor in it.</i>

62
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:21,119
And, in a lot of ways,
I remember Marty telling me

63
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:25,582
about <i>Goodfellas</i>
being almost a dark comedy,

64
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:29,461
<i>and this lent itself
to that style of filmmaking.</i>

65
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:35,467
Marty's so good at doing
the most dramatic version of events,

66
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,719
and making it believable and real.

67
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,556
<i>He can take something off of a page,</i>

68
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,643
turn it into a visual
storytelling masterpiece,

69
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,062
and the energy of it is just so incredible.

70
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,731
<i>It's like a tsunami of craziness.</i>

71
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:53,443
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

72
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:57,656
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

73
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,700
You piss up the SEC's leg,

74
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:01,868
you end up with your tits in a ringer.

75
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:03,453
<i>There's only two types of movies
you can make,</i>

76
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:04,579
or two types of stories to tell.

77
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:07,124
There's the aspirational story,
which is, "Do this,"

78
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,168
or there's the cautionary movie,
which is, "Don't do this."

79
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:12,796
<i>And, you know,
Marty really has done both,</i>

80
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,217
but the "don't do this" moments
in his movies are really memorable.

81
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,595
I had to have total freedom
with the cast and crew

82
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,180
to do what I needed to do.

83
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:24,516
Which meant we all decided that
we were gonna go all the way with it,

84
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,767
as much as we could.

85
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,770
<i>He's obviously attracted
to extreme characters.</i>

86
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,273
<i>And he's done films where,
they're murderers and villains,</i>

87
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:32,983
<i>but you grow to love them.</i>

88
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,277
It's very strange designing clothes

89
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,613
for characters
who you actually have no empathy for,

90
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:39,865
at all.

91
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,659
<i>Knowing that Marty
is the director that he is,</i>

92
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,578
he's gonna bring
something different to it.

93
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:48,665
<i>That's always the big question
that you have going into a movie,</i>

94
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:53,712
whether audiences will be responsive
to people committing atrocious acts.

95
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:57,757
<i>That was one of the things
that Marty said very early on,</i>

96
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,469
<i>you know, "Through my experiences
in making movies,</i>

97
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:04,097
<i>"if you're authentic with the characters
and who they are and don't betray that,</i>

98
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:06,308
"people will go along with anything."

99
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:09,728
It's always fascinating,
about the betrayal of trust,

100
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:11,646
in a story.

101
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,609
You finally found a broker
on Wall Street that you can trust,

102
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:19,070
and who can consistently
make you money.

103
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:20,906
Sound fair enough?

104
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:23,909
<i>And so, there's that element
that's always been in my movies</i>

105
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:26,912
that deals with these characters
that break that trust.

106
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,955
And, right here, going in,

107
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,917
they're pretending there's trust.

108
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,002
Going in, they've broken it already.

109
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,380
<i>It's a very exciting role for Leo.</i>

110
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:38,757
From an audience perspective,

111
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,718
you wanna love him,
but you kind of hate him, too.

112
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,679
<i>And the movie doesn't make
a judgment, it doesn't apologize,</i>

113
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:47,349
doesn't explain,
it just presents the information

114
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,267
for you to draw your own conclusions.

115
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:52,521
One of the references that I had
was the film Caligula.

116
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:55,148
Ýt was a massive orgy
of wealth and drugs,

117
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:59,277
<i>and a group of people that
really wanted to succeed at any cost.</i>

118
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,197
Our attitude was simply,
"Let's really pull no punches.

119
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,282
"Let's not try to whitewash anything.

120
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:07,410
"Let's not try to make these characters,
quote-unquote 'likeable,'

121
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:09,287
"let's portray them for what they are."

122
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:13,124
And that means also exploring
the unbelievable time that they did have

123
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,045
<i>during those few years where
they were completely unregulated</i>

124
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,255
<i>and had no rules.</i>

125
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:21,174
<i>For Leo and I, and the other guys,
to play these people,</i>

126
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,719
we had to understand
that this behavior is okay

127
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,681
within these characters,
even though we disagree with it.

128
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:33,228
<i>To play this person, you have to justify
that you're okay with yourself</i>

129
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,563
<i>doing these things.</i>

130
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:37,732
And then you get home, and you're like,
"Oh, my God! Like, what did I do?"

131
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:42,988
You find all these reasons
and you make up your backstory,

132
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:46,032
and you justify it to yourself,
so that you can really commit

133
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:49,077
to the decisions you're making
in the script, and not feel false about it.

134
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,037
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

135
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,497
- You're a father now.
- I know...

136
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,249
And you're still acting like an infant!

137
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:55,333
Fuck!

138
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,169
Those actors had to have
a reckless abandon,

139
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:01,965
and, just as Marty doesn't judge
the characters in any given moment,

140
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:03,049
the actors can't, either.

141
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:07,721
<i>We are about to become
fucking legends...</i>

142
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,183
<i>With Marty, the energy was almost like
a gigantic party on set all the time.</i>

143
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,395
Everyone brings something fun to
the table, brings something interesting.

144
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,690
<i>"Let's all give each other
something to react to."</i>

145
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,317
<i>For me,
it was one of the most enjoyable</i>

146
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,943
<i>film experiences I've ever had,</i>

147
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,695
<i>and I think Marty will say the same.</i>

148
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,530
<i>In the five films that I've worked
with him,</i>

149
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:28,617
I've never seen him
having this good of a time,

150
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,911
<i>and being as open and free
to try whatever came up.</i>

151
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,874
<i>Marty creates a great atmosphere
on the set.</i>

152
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,626
<i>He's open to suggestions.</i>

153
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,920
He likes people to improvise,
if they can.

154
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:44,132
And there's no more fun for an actor,
than to be able to do that.

155
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:49,179
<i>Marty's way of creating this
in a collaborative atmosphere</i>

156
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,680
<i>for his actors to prosper,</i>

157
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:53,558
and for us as producers,
it gives us nothing but pleasure

158
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:56,269
to see people who are working hard

159
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,355
but at the same time,
getting a lot of pleasure

160
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,273
and getting fun out
of the whole process.

161
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,859
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

162
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:05,612
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

163
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:06,863
Captain who?

164
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:07,947
From the fucking...

165
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,117
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

166
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:14,245
Our approach
was to be very improvisational.

167
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,456
I've never been a fan
of the bush, to be honest.

168
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:17,707
- Really?
- Yeah.

169
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't mind it.

170
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,586
I think all of us
wanted to connect with our characters,

171
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:24,005
<i>and then,
there was a massive rehearsal period,</i>

172
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,340
<i>there was a lot of improvisation there.</i>

173
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,178
And we just integrated all that
rehearsal into the filmmaking process.

174
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,930
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

175
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,683
Well, that's...

176
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:37,143
We had reference points
of where we wanted scenes to go.

177
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,729
<i>But it was incredibly loose.</i>

178
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:43,483
There would be a lot of sequences
that were only a page long,

179
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,944
and we'd be improvising
for hours and hours.

180
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:49,531
<i>And when you have the great actors
that I got to act alongside,</i>

181
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:52,492
anything can happen on that day,
and a lot of times, it did.

182
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,246
<i>Leo's great!
I mean, he's amazing to work with.</i>

183
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:59,457
<i>Just go in any direction,
and he'll just be right there,</i>

184
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:04,421
and it pushes me to do more,
and take more risks.

185
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:06,297
Enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

186
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:10,301
<i>Leo's a daring guy. You can tell
that he's worked with Marty before.</i>

187
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:13,638
They have a partnership,
they have a wonderful shorthand,

188
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:15,432
and it's wonderful to watch them
work together.

189
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,599
FBI!

190
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:19,686
<i>When you get a direction
from Martin Scorsese,</i>

191
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:21,271
<i>you're part of his vision.</i>

192
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:23,565
With that said,
there's also the allowance,

193
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,858
"Now, go do what you do."

194
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,985
<i>I have offered
our lovely sales assistant,</i>

195
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,528
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i>

196
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:32,699
<i>$10,000 to shave her fucking head!</i>

197
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:36,453
Every day we're on set, the scene
would take multiple different directions.

198
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:38,830
<i>He'd say one little riff,
one little bit of improv,</i>

199
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,623
and all of us would react to that,

200
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,626
and we'd have to steer back
to what the scene was ultimately about,

201
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,503
then we'd go off into another tangent.

202
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,714
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

203
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:49,466
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

204
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,677
Jonah was just an electrifying force

205
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,096
<i>that ignited each scene,
every single day,</i>

206
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,098
<i>and I'm very thankful
that he did that for us.</i>

207
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,641
You have my money taped to your tits.

208
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:00,351
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

209
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,271
<i>Jonah really adds a perfect dynamic</i>

210
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:06,024
that you don't see on paper
when you read the script.

211
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,984
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

212
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,986
That's the problem.
That's why they were expensive.

213
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,362
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

214
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:12,614
Stop.

215
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:16,951
He's so witty and clever,
and he just comes out with these lines,

216
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:19,579
<i>said with a complete dead-pan
sort of face.</i>

217
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,539
And, so many times, we just crack up.

218
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,625
I'm just like, "I don't know
how he comes up with this stuff.

219
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,376
"Ýt's hilarious."

220
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,586
You know, if the kid was retarded,

221
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,464
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

222
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,090
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

223
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:33,426
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

224
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:36,888
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,014
Mark Hanna.

226
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:41,893
Matthew came in with a very specific
idea for this character.

227
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,104
Two. One. Let's fuck!

228
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,734
He went into this monolog
that was so incredibly rich and colorful,

229
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:54,155
and insane, and really introduces
the entire audience

230
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,449
to the world of Wall Street at that time.

231
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:57,492
Tootski?

232
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,660
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

233
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:03,498
And encapsulates all the insanity
in one unbelievable monolog.

234
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,833
Name of the game.

235
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,419
Move the money from
your client's pocket into your pocket.

236
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,588
But if you make your clients
money at the same time,

237
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,966
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

238
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,384
No.

239
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,594
He used the reference points
that were in the script,

240
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:19,764
but ultimately, all the color
and all the flavor is all him.

241
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:24,811
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up,
down, sideways, or in fucking circles.

242
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,354
Least of all stockbrokers.

243
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:28,481
He was on set,
sort of, beating his chest.

244
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,736
And I looked at Marty, and I was
like, "Do you see what's going on here?"

245
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,655
<i>And they integrated that into the scene,</i>

246
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,324
and that became the sort of,
chant of <i>Wolf of</i> Wall Street.

247
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:44,289
<i>That was only
the second week of shooting.</i>

248
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:47,667
So, that opened the movie for us,
in a way that we were able to just

249
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:53,798
not have any limits as to what would be
deemed absurd. It's all absurd.

250
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:59,053
<i>Jean Dujardin was another actor
that infused us with incredible energy.</i>

251
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:01,639
<i>This was a world
where he had to speak English a lot.</i>

252
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,476
But his ability to improvise in English
really astounded us.

253
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,020
Yeah. I don't understand. I'm sorry.

254
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:10,231
Anything that Marty wanted to throw
at him, or I wanted to throw at him,

255
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:11,566
<i>he would react to.</i>

256
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,484
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genéve

257
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,987
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

258
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:19,991
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

259
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,118
From a financial standpoint,

260
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:25,079
you are now in heaven.

261
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:27,248
He has a great sense of humor, also.

262
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:29,167
And it transcends the language.

263
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,253
<i>So, he was able to pick out things
in our dialog and go with them,</i>

264
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:33,880
<i>and make it really enjoyable.</i>

265
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:36,758
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

266
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,635
Aren't you married?

267
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:41,179
Well... Yeah, but what?

268
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:42,889
Married people can't have friends?

269
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,683
We're not gonna be friends.

270
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:49,520
Margot Robbie, gave as well
as she took on this, holding her own.

271
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:55,443
Mommy is just so sick
and tired of wearing panties.

272
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,196
She worked diligently
on creating that character.

273
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,865
<i>And, for her,
a lot of the stuff was reactive.</i>

274
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:03,284
When I first read the script,
my initial thought was,

275
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,746
"It'd be an amazing role,
but, my God, I could never get naked!"

276
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,123
And now, it's just like,
"Well, clothes off."

277
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:11,125
Because far crazier things
are happening.

278
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,922
Everyone's so committed
to making the best movie possible

279
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,549
<i>that everyone just goes
further and further with it,</i>

280
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,343
<i>and everyone's just there with you.</i>

281
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,179
You go out on a limb, and everyone's
just going out on a limb as well.

282
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,641
<i>And Marty just lets you
improvise for five minutes,</i>

283
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,226
do whatever you feel like doing.

284
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,978
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

285
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,105
Oh, you don't love me?

286
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,148
<i>The last scene that Naomi's in,</i>

287
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:36,359
we completely made up
the night before shooting it.

288
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:40,738
<i>And it went from being conversation,
to kidnapping and drugs,</i>

289
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:43,700
<i>and punching each other
and smashing windows.</i>

290
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:46,119
<i>It just went
in a whole different direction.</i>

291
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:48,746
<i>Throughout the film,</i>

292
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,416
with all the chaos
and all the decadence,

293
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,919
<i>the money and the cheating
and the stealing and the humor,</i>

294
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,880
there's gotta be one good guy
in this whole damn thing.

295
00:13:57,964 --> 00:13:59,298
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

296
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:01,092
<i>He's an agent with the New York office.</i>

297
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,011
Don't you understand?

298
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,595
He's smart, you're dumb.

299
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,889
<i>Kyle Chandler's character
is incredibly important.</i>

300
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:09,434
Through our conversations,
we created the scene on a boat,

301
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,645
which, to me,
is a very integral part of the movie.

302
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,938
Ever been on one of these before?

303
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:15,732
A boat?

304
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,192
I learned how to sail when I was six.

305
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,778
<i>That was all done through
his improvisation as well.</i>

306
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,572
And that led to this incredible scene

307
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,324
that I think is one of the most
important ones in the entire movie.

308
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,285
You go after real criminals,

309
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,205
which makes me wonder what
the hell you're investigating me for?

310
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:34,709
First day, on the boat,
I haven't even met DiCaprio...

311
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:35,918
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

312
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,962
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

313
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:39,047
No, technically...

314
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,550
Thankfully, Leonardo DiCaprio couldn't
have made me feel more comfortable.

315
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,386
And making your other actor
feel more comfortable

316
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,973
allows not only him to do his work,
but allows you to do your work.

317
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,641
<i>And once you're in that realm,</i>

318
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:51,893
<i>then you just play.</i>

319
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,312
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

320
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,480
Good for you.

321
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:56,731
Me, the little man?

322
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:00,109
They're gonna need to send in
a fucking SWAT team

323
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,528
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

324
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,990
<i>Why bother telling a story
of somebody who's unremarkable?</i>

325
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,618
People say, "Well, that type of person,
that sort."

326
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,370
<i>I guess what that means is that they
try to distance themselves from them.</i>

327
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,915
<i>It's someone else, it's not me.</i>

328
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,001
But, in actuality, I feel
it's not someone else, it's us.

329
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:18,711
It's you and me,

330
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,339
<i>and maybe if we had been born
under different circumstances,</i>

331
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,966
<i>maybe we would have wound up
doing exactly the same things.</i>

332
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,762
It's a matter of facing and recognizing
that part of us,

333
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,014
which is a part
of our common humanity.

334
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,433
Stratton Oakmont is America!

335
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,520
There is a vicarious thrill
about watching criminals.

336
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,315
<i>There's something voyeuristic and fun
about being a part of that lifestyle</i>

337
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,691
<i>without the consequences.</i>

338
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:44,445
<i>You can just live it and go,
"Wow, that was a fun life to view,</i>

339
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,364
<i>"but I'm glad I'm not part of it."</i>

340
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:50,576
I don't think that movies are necessarily
there to tell a moral tale.

341
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:54,455
<i>They're there to depict people
as authentically as you can.</i>

342
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,082
To me, those are the films
that I wanna watch,

343
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,208
films that I think about.

344
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,378
<i>It's been a long journey
to get this movie made,</i>

345
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:03,047
and I'm incredibly happy
with the outcome.

346
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,134
<i>This was a culmination of
a lot of different artists getting together</i>

347
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,010
<i>with a very specific attitude.</i>

348
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:11,514
As a result, you have something
that I think is incredibly loose,

349
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,141
<i>incredibly entertaining,</i>

350
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,559
<i>very authentic.</i>

351
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,602
What movies should ultimately be.

1
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:06,529
- You don't remember me, do you?
- Fuck off! Fuck...

2
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:07,882
WE'RE SCREWED

3
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,044
Jose, she's here.

4
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:46,630
Did you find it?

5
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,650
Don't wave.

6
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,412
OK.

7
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,419
Mom, hurry up.

8
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:51,338
Mother!

9
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:54,633
5 YEARS AGO

10
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:57,510
- ¡Riley!
- He's back.

11
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,929
- ¡Riley!
- Just keep going.

12
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:02,098
I know you can hear me.

13
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:04,768
Honestly,
I don't know what you were thinking.

14
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,813
Sorry, Peg.
I said I was sorry.

15
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:10,649
This parking lot is
where we settled.

16
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:14,110
Everyone knows it,
from here to the Pottery Barn.

17
00:06:14,118 --> 00:06:16,321
We have earned this
position because we sell...

18
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,949
more Christmas cookies
for the Fireflies, that no one.

19
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:21,534
Maybe if you went to a meeting of
Den's mothers, you would know that you are...

20
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,329
Well, not all of us can
sit in our perfect little houses,

21
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,830
South of the Boulevard, Peg.

22
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Some of us
we have to work.

23
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,338
I will file a formal complaint...

24
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,406
in the next one
Den mothers meeting.

25
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,924
Okay, do it.

26
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:40,720
I don't think you're material
for the Firefly troop.

27
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,770
Neither.

28
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:43,723
Come on, Penelope.

29
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:52,816
What an idiot.

30
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:55,819
- Don't say that.
- Well, it is.

31
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,904
Well, maybe so. But still...

32
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:01,049
You should have given it to him
a punch in the face.

33
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,705
A punch in the face?

34
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,832
You can't go around hitting
to people who are idiots.

35
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,418
Then you'll be so bad
like them.

36
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:14,045
Mother,
I know you took the morning off.

37
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,257
Thank you for trying to help me.

38
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:21,261
Do you know how amazing you are?

39
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:26,933
Happy birthday, get in the car.

40
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,560
Run, run, run.
Come on, come on.

41
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:31,064
Listen, I wouldn't ask you...

42
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,357
When do you think it will be?

43
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:37,284
Next month.

44
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:39,696
True. Yes, thank you.

45
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:03,303
- Hello, daddy.
- Hello, little girl.

46
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:04,596
- How are you?
- Hello.

47
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:05,972
- I'm fine.
- GOOD.

48
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:08,099
- I should be home by 4:30 pm
- OK.

49
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,935
Someone is going to have one
birthday party.

50
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,770
The other children
They will be there at 4:00 pm

51
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:13,658
Can you handle them by
half an hour on your own?

52
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,273
How many other children?

53
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:17,150
All my friends, daddy.

54
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,987
Chris North, everything in your life
has prepared for this moment.

55
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:22,614
Hey, I'm going to be late. I love you.

56
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,782
I love you, goodbye.

57
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,742
- I love you.
- Bye, guys. Bye!

58
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,452
Come here, birthday girl!

59
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,457
Hello, Mr. Watson.
I'm late. Sorry.

60
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:33,333
Well, we'll talk.
about it later.

61
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:34,818
I have to do some
Christmas shopping.

62
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:37,128
- OK.
- And I need you to close today.

63
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,922
- Today, it's actually...
- Dee-Dee called in sick.

64
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,465
So you'll be closing.

65
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:42,159
- It's my daughter's birthday...
- You asked for overtime.

66
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,594
I'm giving them to you.
You will be closing.

67
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:52,978
Are you sure, Mickey?
Are you really sure?

68
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:55,707
- Because, don't put me in a situation...
- I have children too.

69
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,692
Ten minutes and our
lives will change.

70
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,653
The lives of our
children will change.

71
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:04,489
Nobody knows, nobody will know, everything
all you have to do is drive.

72
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:05,991
I'll take care of everything else.

73
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,617
I don't know, Mickey. I don't know.

74
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:10,870
You want to get Riley a house,
TRUE?

75
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:12,831
A good school for Carly.

76
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,333
This shitty mechanic,
It's not going to get you there, buddy.

77
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,835
This will do it.

78
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:30,898
Hello!

79
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,184
I'm here now.

80
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:34,853
Happy Birthday...

81
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,072
Where is everyone?

82
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:43,194
Nobody came.

83
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:45,037
Nobody came?

84
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:55,707
Riley, Peg.

85
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,500
Let's forget that little problem,

86
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,586
in the parking lot,

87
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:02,047
We are having a little

88
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:03,882
Penelope invited the whole class.

89
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:07,219
I think Carly's invitation

90
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:11,223
Feel free to stop by.

91
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:14,434
I'm sure you remember

92
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,685
Hope to see you girls.

93
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,521
I told you.

94
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,565
You should have given it to him
a punch in the face.

95
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,701
You know what, my friend?

96
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,249
We don't need them anyway.

97
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:39,751
It's your birthday.

98
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,253
My birthday sucks!

99
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,754
Carly, the language.

100
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:43,880
He does.

101
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,718
We're going out for pizza.

102
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,306
We'll do it, just the three of us.
It will be fun.

103
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:55,934
And then we're going to go...
We are going to the Christmas carnival.

104
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,144
- Yes!
- Yes, the Christmas carnival.

105
00:10:58,152 --> 00:11:01,940
And when we get there,
we are going to ride every attraction,

106
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,608
already play all the games.

107
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:06,778
We will do all the infestation tests
of viruses and germs... Whatever.

108
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:08,947
But I'm okay with that,
It's your birthday.

109
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:10,824
- And then...
- Frozen?

110
00:11:10,832 --> 00:11:12,576
- Frozen.
- Ice cream. Yes!

111
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:15,161
Fuck yeah.
Ice cream, yes, all you want.

112
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,956
All right, we're going to have a great night.
Go get a jacket.

113
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:20,041
- Come on, come on.
- Yes! I'll be ready in a second.

114
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,507
Sorry, I just...

115
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:28,675
Hey, honey...

116
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,511
it's not always going to be like this.

117
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:33,145
Do you promise me?

118
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:36,516
Yes. I promise.

119
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,191
Come here.

120
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:48,587
This is Mickey. I'm not here.

121
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:50,822
Mickey, hi, I'm Chris.

122
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:53,373
I'm out.

123
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:54,993
I won't risk it.

124
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,830
It's not worth it, my friend.

125
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,666
Okay, listen, I'm sorry.
Call me when you hear this.

126
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:05,670
- Where is your dad?
- It's out here.

127
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:06,678
GOOD.

128
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:10,217
Carnival!

129
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,225
OK.

130
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:12,976
Here we go.

131
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:16,973
Carnival. I'm so excited.

132
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:25,649
It's me. Is the boss around?

133
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:28,318
I found the other one.

134
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:32,906
Oh really,
are you trying to scam me?

135
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,535
Did you really think that you
Would you get away with it, Mickey?

136
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:41,039
Boss, it's for you.

137
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,089
Es Cortez.

138
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:48,255
I have to take this call.

139
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:50,584
I hope you don't mind, Mickey.

140
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,553
Talk to me. What's wrong with you?

141
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,888
I'm following the other guy.

142
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:58,522
Liquidate it.

143
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,017
Let it be an example.

144
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,186
A very noisy one.

145
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:09,366
Mickey,

146
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,571
is this what you wanted?

147
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,003
Will this make all your
problems disappear?

148
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:22,296
Are you feeling okay?

149
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:26,585
Have some money on you.

150
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:29,212
- TRUE?
- No...

151
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,138
TRUE?

152
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:33,258
Damn fucking.

153
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:42,601
King! I am the King!

154
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:44,269
More like the Queen.

155
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,274
Give me that one.

156
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:54,279
High five!

157
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:58,825
I kept my eyes open
almost all the time...!

158
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,619
I hope I look smart.

159
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:02,787
- Not so much.
- Look at me.

160
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:05,832
You're a brat.

161
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,292
- Quite charming.
- Frozen!

162
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:09,426
Let's go for some ice cream.

163
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,433
- Come on.
- Here we go, here we go.

164
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:24,517
Hello, what's it going to be?

165
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:27,354
Two of his best Rocky Roads,
and...

166
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:29,147
Yes, and whatever the miss...

167
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:30,649
Mint. Double scoop.

168
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,025
And one of two mint balls.

169
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,318
- OK.
- It's her birthday.

170
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:34,861
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

171
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:59,553
- With the...
- Yes, I agree.

172
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:01,513
My God, look at that.

173
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:02,563
Can I prove that?

174
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:05,182
- Do you like it?
- No, I don't like it.

175
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,728
- Birthday girl.
- Bye, cupcake.

176
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:17,054
- I'll get a napkin.
- OK.

177
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,154
OK.

178
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:21,658
- Do you mind if I have one?
- Yes of course.

179
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,786
- Thank you. Have a good night.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

180
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,582
- I know.
- Every day!

181
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,251
Birthdays every day.

182
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,179
Hey, make sure that
we can put it in the car.

183
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:21,785
List?

184
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,656
Three, two...

185
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:29,327
Adult woman, 35 years old.
Gunshot wound to the head.

186
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:31,871
Severe cerebral hemorrhage,
vital signs remaining.

187
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:33,338
Closing.

188
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:36,174
We're ok.

189
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:40,846
May I browse?

190
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,817
It's a mess, I understand.

191
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:02,694
But you have to put
your serious face.

192
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:04,195
We have a job here,
OK?

193
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,701
It's not easy when you're a kid.

194
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,329
It's not supposed to be easy.

195
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:15,332
That's the difference
between us and them.

196
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,437
I was supposed to be called in
the moment he woke up.

197
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:39,606
You don't wake up from a
medically induced coma,

198
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,024
as easy as turning on a
light switch.

199
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,593
The shot may not hit him.
has hit the brain,

200
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:45,028
- but brain inflammation...
- But will it be okay?

201
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:51,076
The "it's okay" is
out of my hands.

202
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,411
When he recovered his memory...

203
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:55,330
We had to contain her
and had to be sedated.

204
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,590
Mrs. North.

205
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:01,237
My name is Detective
Stan Carmichael...

206
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,754
Detective.

207
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:05,382
I've been waiting to talk
with you for a long time.

208
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:11,263
I am so sorry for your loss.

209
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,139
Forgive me for appearing
so suddenly,

210
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:15,267
but, we have three
suspects in custody,

211
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,227
to whom otherwise
we would have to release tomorrow.

212
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,979
Detective, this is not the time.

213
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:21,481
I... I can talk.

214
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:29,739
We believe that what happened can
be related to her husband.

215
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:32,742
There were rumors that
was involved...

216
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,578
in a plan to rob
a drug dealer...

217
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:36,288
called Diego Garcia.

218
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,956
I wouldn't do it...
He wouldn't do that.

219
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:40,083
No, yes, you are absolutely right.

220
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,168
We recovered a voice message
on your friend's phone,

221
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,296
her husband refused to continue
go ahead with this, but,

222
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,631
the word had already spread.

223
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:48,800
And, back with Garcia.

224
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,638
Now, an informant has informed us
given a very credible lead,

225
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,182
but no witness is there
willing to take a step forward.

226
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,602
We know everything,
but we can't prove anything.

227
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:04,107
Detective.

228
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,515
I think that's enough
for now.

229
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,447
Get some rest,
Mrs. North, I'll be back.

230
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,199
But I...

231
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:16,661
I thought you'd want to have this.

232
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:48,659
Yes I saw them.

233
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:52,364
All right, bring them on.

234
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:53,531
Come on. Get in there.

235
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:12,891
It's number five.

236
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,720
Number five, one step forward.

237
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,393
Get them out. Next group.

238
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Number three.

239
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:35,947
Number three, one step forward.

240
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:41,587
That's him.

241
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:48,635
The four.

242
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:58,312
Are you sure?

243
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,605
Yes, I'm sure.

244
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:14,446
Hey, thanks.

245
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,540
What's wrong, aren't you hungry?

246
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,128
Tell me what this is.

247
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:34,799
That would be a Detective badge.

248
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:38,595
That's all they found of the
last policeman who went after Diego Garcia.

249
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:43,475
It was in his locker,
hanging in a locker here,

250
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:46,244
inside the Headquarters of
Metropolitan Police Homicides.

251
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,147
Does Garcia have people inside?

252
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:56,154
Garcia has a nickname,

253
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:57,989
There's a reason for that shit,
Stan.

254
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:01,326
Chris North is
He didn't even rob Garcia.

255
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:07,457
He just considered it, and ended up on the side
wrong side of the lawn, with his daughter.

256
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:10,502
Whatever happens with this case,
let it happen.

257
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:12,003
Don't be stupid.

258
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:14,172
They will only kill you and
that won't change anything.

259
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:04,938
Hello?

260
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:11,855
- Mrs. North.
- Who are you?

261
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:14,357
I hope you don't mind
that has entered.

262
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:17,360
I am... I am a friend.

263
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:19,905
Do you want to sit down?

264
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:21,615
What do you want?

265
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,911
Eviction notice.

266
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,040
I can only imagine how horrible
what all this has been like for you.

267
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,751
I mean, how can you
start to recover from something like this?

268
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,212
Why are you here?

269
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:38,256
I just want to give you some advice.

270
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:46,223
The road to recovery
has to start somewhere.

271
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:52,479
The recognition that...
As heartbreaking as it may be,

272
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:59,194
In the end, nothing will come of it
back to his family.

273
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:05,283
I know, and that's the sad thing,
but inevitable truth.

274
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,748
Possibly,
maybe not immediately,

275
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:14,501
but in the end the moment will come
to keep going.

276
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:19,422
New place, new clothes,
new memories.

277
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:27,973
A new life.

278
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:38,282
What is this?

279
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:47,450
Lorazepam. Lithium. Resperidone?
It is an antipsychotic.

280
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,458
Listen!

281
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:53,623
I think it's time for you to go.

282
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:55,542
Maybe he made a mistake.

283
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,836
His memory is a little fuzzy.

284
00:25:57,844 --> 00:25:59,462
I'm just putting it out there.

285
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,548
Maybe he didn't see things...

286
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:03,236
the way in which
he thought he had seen them.

287
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,054
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!

288
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:10,063
Get out of here!

289
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,352
Do you think you're going to get justice?

290
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:17,355
Make everyone pay?

291
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:20,901
You won't have it.

292
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:22,027
Go fuck yourself!

293
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:39,169
Is there anything else you want to ask?
to the witness, Mr. Henderson?

294
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:41,004
One last question, Your Honor.

295
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:43,506
Mrs. North,
just to clarify one point.

296
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,050
Did you see them get out of the car?

297
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:47,219
No.

298
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:50,430
Did the car stop moving?

299
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:52,780
No.

300
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:56,269
And yet you identified my clients?
like the alleged shooters?

301
00:26:57,904 --> 00:26:59,731
- They did it.
- I object, Your Honor.

302
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:00,899
I ask that it be reached
a legal conclusion.

303
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:01,691
Accepted.

304
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:04,069
Ms. North, we are interested in the facts.
No opinions.

305
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:05,070
He just asked me one question.

306
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:06,279
- And I just answered.
- Alright.

307
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:09,199
Identified my clients,
correct?

308
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,409
- Yes, I did. They were...
- Okay. Okay.

309
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:16,289
And are you taking any?
antipsychotic medication?

310
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:19,125
That?

311
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,628
- Lorazepam. Lithium. Resperidone?
- Wait.

312
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:23,405
- Is there anything else we should know?
- But that's not...

313
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:24,422
Wait, that's not accurate.

314
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,882
He identified not one,
but to three men...

315
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,593
in a moving vehicle
at night at a distance of 10 meters.

316
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:30,095
- After a month in a coma...
- I saw them.

317
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:31,914
- And a mental breakdown...
- It's not something that is forgotten.

318
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:34,057
And under the influence of
antidepressants and antipsychotics.

319
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:35,725
Excuse me, you're not listening to me.

320
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:38,562
Is it possible that your memory
not be who you thought you were?

321
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:41,731
No.

322
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,571
There are no further questions, Your Honor.

323
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,739
Wait, but you're not listening to me.
Can you help me here?

324
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:52,242
He is the District Attorney.
Can't you do anything?

325
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,952
I didn't even take those pills...

326
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,663
It is the opinion of this Court
that in this preliminary hearing,

327
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,498
the evidence is insufficient...

328
00:27:58,506 --> 00:28:00,917
for a jury
reasonably conclude...

329
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:04,129
that the State has complied
with their burden of proof.

330
00:28:04,137 --> 00:28:07,465
I see no reason to retain
the accused for trial.

331
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,271
Wait a moment.
This can't end.

332
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:24,107
- These men killed my family.
- Mrs. North, you may leave.

333
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:25,650
No, they killed my family!

334
00:28:25,658 --> 00:28:27,652
- This guy showed up at my house.
- You may leave, Mrs. North.

335
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,987
No, I'm not done!

336
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,238
You may leave, madam...

337
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:31,489
- He offered me money!
- Mrs. North.

338
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:33,992
- No, no, no, no! I'm not finished!
- Mrs. North, you may leave!

339
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,577
They are murderers!
They are fucking murderers!

340
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:36,745
Mrs. North.
Officers!

341
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,458
Get away from me!
I'm going to kill them.

342
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:55,805
Officers, get this woman out of here.

343
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,559
Mrs. North, the
I will be sending a...

344
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:01,478
treatment program
mental health.

345
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:03,521
Next case.

346
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:16,243
Why is it bleeding?
What happened to him?

347
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:18,370
He kept hitting his head
head against the bars.

348
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:24,167
- Now she's all yours.
- OK.

349
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:27,003
Mrs. North? Riley,
I'm Detective Stan Carmichael.

350
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:28,088
Can you hear me?

351
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:29,923
Hey guys, let's go.

352
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:31,925
He saw his family murdered and the
guys who did it walked away.

353
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,176
How about you relax?

354
00:29:35,562 --> 00:29:37,556
List?
One two three.

355
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:44,229
- Where are you going?
- County General, a internarla.

356
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:46,731
That place is a nightmare.

357
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:49,734
County General, a internarla.

358
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:51,361
That place is a nightmare.

359
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:55,198
They hold on.
Let me make a call.

360
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:01,461
Understand!

361
00:30:03,923 --> 00:30:05,375
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

362
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:08,420
I'm sorry.

363
00:30:35,997 --> 00:30:37,949
NORTH

364
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:39,791
Well, you said it.

365
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:45,832
It will appear.

366
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,626
One way or another,
they always do.

367
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:58,303
THE PRESENT

368
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:14,110
Carmichael, 3-8-7-7-7,
Gang Homicides.

369
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:30,794
Aren't you especially
beautiful this morning?

370
00:31:30,843 --> 00:31:32,462
Thank you for coming.

371
00:31:32,512 --> 00:31:34,512
I have always firmly believed
in restful sleep.

372
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:37,634
Professional advice.

373
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:41,638
Wait until you are
dead before being embalmed.

374
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:47,693
Well,

375
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:50,146
that's new.

376
00:32:32,655 --> 00:32:34,592
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

377
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:36,735
- Good morning, Lisa. Do you have a minute?
- That?

378
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:38,703
Someone drove a truck
to a gun shop...

379
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:40,906
in San Bernardino,
a couple of nights ago.

380
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:42,866
The place was
class 3 armament.

381
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,367
And military grade stuff.

382
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:47,245
The ATF called us after reviewing
security recordings.

383
00:32:47,253 --> 00:32:50,457
It was a woman. They have a part
from the suspect's face.

384
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,709
Give it to the DHS Fusion Center.

385
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,045
Let them run it through their system
facial recognition.

386
00:32:55,094 --> 00:32:57,547
I already did it. I have a possible
Customs coincidence...

387
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:59,758
in a stowaway incident,
a container ship,

388
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:02,385
in the port of Los Angeles
three months ago.

389
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:04,763
Your name appeared in the
case file, so...

390
00:33:10,443 --> 00:33:11,443
Inman.

391
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,566
Inman.

392
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:28,495
Maybe you're thinking
the same as me?

393
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:37,337
Carmichael.

394
00:33:39,514 --> 00:33:40,514
Who?

395
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:43,141
Yes of course.

396
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:46,263
The FBI wants to talk to us.

397
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:47,271
The Federals?

398
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:14,226
Have they run out of terrorists?

399
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:16,853
How do the Feds care?
for a mother who takes to football?

400
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,605
Didn't it hit him in the
head five years ago?

401
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:21,024
Hitting idiots no
It is a federal crime.

402
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:24,110
Bank robbery is.

403
00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:25,695
The night that Riley North
they got away,

404
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:28,698
stole $55,000 from the
Bank where I worked.

405
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:32,035
Are we talking about the same thing?
Riley North? Bank Robbery?

406
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:35,622
She just disappeared,
completely off the grid,

407
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,791
as if it had ceased to exist.

408
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:39,876
You're fucking with me.
She wasn't that type.

409
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:41,419
I agree.

410
00:35:41,427 --> 00:35:44,464
A woman with no criminal record, even if
his family is brutally murdered,

411
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,800
He doesn't just get up and take $50,000.
and then he leaves.

412
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:48,767
It caught my attention.

413
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:57,310
How many times did he betray
to your oath, Your Honor?

414
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:03,233
I think it's so corrupt,
that they didn't even notice.

415
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:06,319
OK...

416
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:11,074
So, here's the deal.

417
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:14,244
If you can tell me my name,
I'll let him live.

418
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:17,998
I mean, he'll eat for a
lived the rest of his life,

419
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:20,333
but he will live.

420
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,341
Are you ready?

421
00:36:23,303 --> 00:36:27,924
Do you remember my name?

422
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:35,765
Interpol tagged her
four months later.

423
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:38,643
He used his real name in
a hospital in Hong Kong.

424
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:41,104
He showed up with a dislocated shoulder,

425
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:43,273
facial fracture, ruptured spleen.

426
00:36:43,323 --> 00:36:45,108
- A car accident?
- We don't know.

427
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:47,027
He left before
we could stop her.

428
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:48,445
He disappeared.

429
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:50,530
From time to time,
a clue comes from somewhere.

430
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:53,199
We can almost corroborate some of them,
to others not.

431
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:56,286
It's a shit magnet. Why?
are they wasting our time?

432
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:57,816
So,
we found this on YouTube.

433
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,132
Wait, is that...
Is that Riley North?

434
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,967
The same,
in Europe last year,

435
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:13,657
under one of the four identities
that we have tracked so far.

436
00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:15,831
She became very, very good at
stay off the radar.

437
00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:18,850
So he spends the last five years
bouncing all over the world,

438
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:22,562
learning to get into trouble.
AND?

439
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,314
We don't know exactly
what was I doing.

440
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:26,008
What we do know is
who arrived in Los Angeles...

441
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:27,192
three months ago.

442
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,029
Security cameras
they got this during...

443
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:32,864
a shoplifting
of weapons a few days ago.

444
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:34,908
She just took it
military grade.

445
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:39,037
Automatic rifles, high-power shotguns
capacity, specific ammunition.

446
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:41,331
I knew exactly
what I was looking for.

447
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:43,833
She's back.

448
00:37:43,883 --> 00:37:46,753
And today, they found the three guys
who allegedly killed his family.

449
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:48,880
Hanging, execution style.

450
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:52,926
Do you know what today's date is?

451
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:54,594
- What do you say?
- The date.

452
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:55,762
What is today's date?

453
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,180
It's December 21st.

454
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:00,525
The fifth anniversary of the
murder of his family.

455
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:10,527
This thing wrapped around you is
detonation cord, explosive cord.

456
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:12,112
You can cut any
thing with this.

457
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,115
Cut down trees, cut down concrete...

458
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:17,082
To corrupt judges.

459
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:34,759
Watching someone take everything away from you...

460
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,555
All you have,

461
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:41,391
everything you're going to have,

462
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,394
just go away.

463
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,070
It hurts, right?

464
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:52,736
And knowing that it's all over,

465
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:55,238
and there is nothing you can do
do about it.

466
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:03,788
He did not serve justice,
Your Honor. But I will do it.

467
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:51,002
Carmichael.

468
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:53,387
That?

469
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:55,806
OK.

470
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:58,016
Thank you.

471
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:01,221
¿Steven Goldman y Robert Henderson,

472
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:02,847
the Prosecutor and the lawyer
at that hearing,

473
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:05,058
- five years ago?
- Yes.

474
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:07,060
Goldman was found
face down in his pool...

475
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:09,148
and Henderson's house is
set fire with him inside,

476
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:10,564
last night, both of them.

477
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,066
And that's not all.

478
00:40:13,074 --> 00:40:14,843
The bomb squad of the Police of
Los Angeles is currently in the place...

479
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,736
from the residence of
son of James Stevens,

480
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:19,489
Judge of the Criminal Court,
recently retired.

481
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:22,325
A kind of
explosion in his house.

482
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,015
There was hardly enough of him left,
to fill an evidence bag.

483
00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:28,164
I don't think I have to
tell them who he was.

484
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:29,457
We need to go further with this.

485
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:31,376
APB, the media of
communication, the whole thing.

486
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,686
That looks good. Stack it up.

487
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,993
We need to talk to you.

488
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:06,453
- We have a problem.
- That?

489
00:41:10,757 --> 00:41:11,791
Just a minute.

490
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:15,212
Our informant called.

491
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:18,048
She caught a Judge and...

492
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:19,716
And a lawyer we pay.

493
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:21,526
He also liquidated some
of our friends.

494
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,136
Those we send to
eliminate her husband.

495
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,388
When the fuck was that?

496
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:27,140
About five years ago.

497
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:28,148
Is there a problem?

498
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:30,477
No, just...

499
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:34,314
Go and get Jessica out of the car,

500
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:35,941
bring it with a couple of shots.

501
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:38,408
And that matter?

502
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:43,490
Set a reward for
his head,

503
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:44,574
and we leave it for today.

504
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:53,750
Some personnel things.

505
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,918
You know how it is.

506
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:56,962
I have ten more tons...

507
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,838
Your nonsense is not the
reason why I'm here.

508
00:41:58,846 --> 00:42:01,132
Know,
you shouldn't play with the Cartel.

509
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:05,345
I came to deliver a
message from my father.

510
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,190
It's just a misunderstanding.

511
00:42:17,198 --> 00:42:18,775
If a shipment is lost,

512
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:21,152
maybe it's a mistake.

513
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:23,029
But two?

514
00:42:24,163 --> 00:42:25,907
In a week?

515
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,784
Do you think I tried to steal from them?

516
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:29,661
Would it have lasted?
so much being stupid?

517
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:34,624
Everyone wants
be a big dog.

518
00:42:34,674 --> 00:42:36,793
Little dogs trying
from eating my food.

519
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:37,843
That's all it is.

520
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:41,972
Hello, babe.

521
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:00,400
Get the fuck out of here.

522
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:07,657
There is something you have to remember.

523
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:16,458
You're still a puppy.

524
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:18,907
Don't let our affairs
have interference again.

525
00:43:56,923 --> 00:43:57,923
Who is that for?

526
00:43:59,926 --> 00:44:00,926
It's for you.

527
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:03,262
Thank you.

528
00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:07,558
Is he okay?

529
00:44:08,476 --> 00:44:10,595
Grandma.

530
00:44:10,603 --> 00:44:14,099
Sometimes I have to take care of him.

531
00:44:14,107 --> 00:44:16,518
Stop requested. Please,

532
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:23,817
Dad. Let's go.

533
00:44:25,785 --> 00:44:26,785
Bye bye.

534
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:29,906
I told you no
you will talk to strangers.

535
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:32,909
Understand.

536
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,494
Where did you get that?
shitty toy?

537
00:44:36,462 --> 00:44:38,081
Sit down. Sit down.

538
00:44:47,473 --> 00:44:48,675
Give me your wallet.

539
00:44:48,683 --> 00:44:49,683
OK.

540
00:44:50,143 --> 00:44:51,761
OK.

541
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:53,649
I'm going to need you to
stay still, please.

542
00:44:58,026 --> 00:45:00,353
Okay. What do we have here?

543
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:02,397
Bryan Hartley, 1214 de
Harlow Street.

544
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:04,941
Open your mouth, Bryan.

545
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,280
This is one of those moments
that change a life.

546
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:11,907
Do I have your attention?

547
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,493
I want you to take your child
Christmas shopping.

548
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:18,663
I want you to give it to him
best time of his life.

549
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:20,707
I want you to mature and be
the father he deserves.

550
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:22,709
Did you understand me?

551
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:24,336
I understand.

552
00:45:24,344 --> 00:45:25,962
- Say it again.
- I understand.

553
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,672
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

554
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,299
1214 Harlow.

555
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:30,884
I will never forget you, Bryan.

556
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:32,559
Is it clear?

557
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:35,472
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

558
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:36,681
What are you still doing here?

559
00:45:41,027 --> 00:45:43,355
Let's go.

560
00:45:43,363 --> 00:45:46,316
If you sell him anything else, I'll blow you up.
to pieces you and this place.

561
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:47,734
Did you understand?

562
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:49,194
- Do you have a car?
- Yes.

563
00:45:49,202 --> 00:45:50,202
Give me the keys.

564
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:53,073
Consider it rent.

565
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:56,428
Understand.

566
00:46:56,436 --> 00:46:57,929
You are in the wrong place.

567
00:46:57,937 --> 00:46:59,389
I'm not really.

568
00:46:59,397 --> 00:47:00,515
Get the fuck out of here.

569
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:35,717
- What's up, friend?
- What's up?

570
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,677
Listen, I'm about to
to get this money.

571
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,743
In this neighborhood normally

572
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:03,453
Maureen, ¿puedes decirnos algo más?

573
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:05,580
What do we know about the

574
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,625
It is suspected that he was

575
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:11,586
And possibly kill

576
00:48:11,636 --> 00:48:15,173
Authorities believe she is armed.

577
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:17,008
If you see her,

578
00:48:17,016 --> 00:48:19,056
the phone number

579
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,074
It has been called the

580
00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:43,702
What can be expected from

581
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,538
What will the agencies respond?

582
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:54,845
What the fuck...?

583
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,844
Come on. Let's get out of here.

584
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:01,852
Let's go!

585
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:11,021
Shit.

586
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,005
- Hello.
- Oh, God!

587
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:02,716
I have questions for you.

588
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:03,800
You're not busy, are you?

589
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:05,058
No.

590
00:51:05,226 --> 00:51:07,178
A fire has destroyed

591
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:09,097
piñata shop in

592
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:12,183
Loca.
Crazy, crazy.

593
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:15,186
She's completely crazy, my friend.

594
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:17,397
You already said that, Marvin.

595
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:19,065
Yes, well,
I'm saying it again.

596
00:51:19,073 --> 00:51:21,109
So you decided to tell him everything.

597
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,445
The whole damn operation.

598
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:27,199
Yes, but you would have
done the same thing. It's...

599
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:29,743
I'm so impressed
because of how stupid you are.

600
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:32,245
How much did he take?

601
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:35,248
She... Well,
She didn't take anything. She...

602
00:51:36,507 --> 00:51:38,501
She burned all the money.

603
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:47,219
It's the last shit that
I need it right now.

604
00:51:47,227 --> 00:51:48,845
Boss, I'm so sorry.

605
00:51:48,853 --> 00:51:50,263
You know you never...

606
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,598
It's just that this was
an extenuating situation...

607
00:51:51,606 --> 00:51:52,891
Shut the fuck up!

608
00:51:56,236 --> 00:51:59,606
Trust me,
we're going to have a short...

609
00:51:59,614 --> 00:52:02,192
a very short conversation
about this in a minute.

610
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:08,365
Double the security.

611
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:10,700
Put that bitch in a
box before sunset.

612
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,954
Before I do
that they kill us all.

613
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,998
Thank you, Joanna.

614
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:18,625
Today, Los Angeles has been

615
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:20,835
a disturbing series

616
00:52:20,885 --> 00:52:23,922
What some are speculating about

617
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,800
possibly even the

618
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:29,553
According to sources from the Department

619
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:32,055
everything seems to lead to the same name,

620
00:52:32,063 --> 00:52:33,348
Riley North.

621
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:36,017
So who is Riley North?

622
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:38,645
Looking at social media,

623
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:40,021
One possible link is that,

624
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:41,606
the husband and daughter of

625
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:44,651
were killed in a shootout

626
00:52:44,659 --> 00:52:48,822
There is a storm of speculation

627
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,950
Friends, I'm going to need you.
behind the tape, thank you.

628
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,827
Thirty-four, Asian, male.

629
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:56,329
- Yeah, hey. Take a look.
- Approximately...

630
00:52:56,337 --> 00:52:58,081
Well, I have a dozen
of witnesses who...

631
00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:00,166
suddenly they were left
blind and saw nothing.

632
00:53:00,174 --> 00:53:02,085
So we have that
in our favor.

633
00:53:02,093 --> 00:53:04,504
What the hell are Koreans doing in
the low-rise neighborhoods with Garcia?

634
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:05,255
Money laundering.

635
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:08,425
Garcia is using his
infrastructure to launder your money.

636
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:10,093
These bastards are not going
to be happy.

637
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:12,596
It's going to get a lot worse,
if we don't get ahead of this.

638
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,751
We have all the whites and
city blacks looking for,

639
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:20,103
each camera.
His face is all over the news.

640
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:21,897
Well, she knows what she's doing.

641
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:24,925
It's becoming a typical
shitstorm on social media.

642
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:26,709
Garcia is going to love it
all this attention.

643
00:53:28,536 --> 00:53:29,536
Hey, buddy.

644
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:34,784
There's something I want you to see.

645
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:36,335
Here.

646
00:53:37,712 --> 00:53:39,247
Back, thanks.

647
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:44,127
Well, this is a tough sell.

648
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:46,421
Do you really think that?
Riley North did this?

649
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:48,340
Well, your Federal girlfriend thinks so.

650
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:50,926
- My what?
- Stan, my friend,

651
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:54,012
you have to concentrate on the task
that you have in your hands. It's embarrassing.

652
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,473
The only interest I have in
Agent Inman is professional.

653
00:53:56,481 --> 00:53:58,225
- If you say so.
- Jesus Christ.

654
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,794
Okay, I'll go to Gangs and Narcotics.
and I'll see if they have any information...

655
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:02,479
of the locations
suspected of Garcia.

656
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:04,439
Get a list,
prepare some codes 5,

657
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:05,982
keep watch and see if he appears.

658
00:54:07,992 --> 00:54:10,320
Be careful who you
you ask those kinds of questions.

659
00:54:10,328 --> 00:54:12,948
- For the love of God!
Here we go again. - Hey.

660
00:54:12,997 --> 00:54:16,076
It only takes a few
types in the right places.

661
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:17,619
Watch your ass,
that's all I'm saying.

662
00:54:18,545 --> 00:54:20,455
And say hi to Bigfoot for me.

663
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:22,040
What, a lovers' quarrel?

664
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:24,125
What about Bigfoot?

665
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:28,213
Yes, we were debating who would
impress with your FBI prowess.

666
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:29,221
I won.

667
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:32,300
So what are you thinking?

668
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,886
Riley North arrived in Los Angeles
almost three months ago.

669
00:54:34,894 --> 00:54:37,305
Aren't you curious?
to know where he has been?

670
00:54:38,189 --> 00:54:40,389
They have a Department of
Crime Analysis, right?

671
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:42,644
Yes, come with me, I'll take you there.

672
00:55:05,091 --> 00:55:07,878
A Cartel on our ass.
And now the Korean mafia?

673
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,046
What are you going to do now?

674
00:55:12,223 --> 00:55:14,634
I bet Marvin
He told about the laboratory.

675
00:55:14,642 --> 00:55:16,511
- I bet.
- GOOD.

676
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:19,361
So we sent everyone there
and we kill her when she shows up.

677
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:28,113
Boss.

678
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:34,154
How did you find out about Marvin?

679
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:40,160
The only guy who knew everything.

680
00:55:43,129 --> 00:55:44,414
And she doesn't kill him.

681
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:47,125
How did she know?

682
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:50,545
He must have been watching us.

683
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:51,630
You think?

684
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:55,008
Those lost shipments,
it was her.

685
00:55:56,142 --> 00:55:57,802
He's been stirring things up,

686
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:01,181
discovering the
moving parts.

687
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:03,391
The bitch has been fucking us
fucking around for weeks.

688
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:06,311
If that is the case,

689
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,231
then maybe I hope that
let's send everyone to the lab.

690
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,483
That dance is over.

691
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:13,902
The whore wants to have
the damn laboratory,

692
00:56:13,952 --> 00:56:15,528
Well, I'll give him the damn lab.

693
00:57:14,512 --> 00:57:17,841
The system tracks crimes
reported in real time.

694
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:19,926
From this data, we determine
where to send our resources.

695
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:21,494
And prevent them
problems spread.

696
00:57:21,853 --> 00:57:23,054
Any anomalies?

697
00:57:23,062 --> 00:57:25,307
Areas of violent crime,
higher than expected?

698
00:57:25,356 --> 00:57:26,850
Besides tonight?

699
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:29,728
Going back a few weeks,
Is there any area that stands out?

700
00:57:29,736 --> 00:57:31,938
This cannot predict where
will appear next time.

701
00:57:31,946 --> 00:57:33,773
Could you tell me where you've been?

702
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:36,276
Wherever he goes, people die.
He has to be living somewhere.

703
00:57:36,284 --> 00:57:38,236
Maybe I can locate
where he has been staying,

704
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:40,204
their base of operations.
Find her that way.

705
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:52,083
Nothing.

706
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:55,045
No sector or
neighborhood stands out.

707
00:57:55,053 --> 00:57:57,255
There are no abnormal peaks in the
crimes nowhere.

708
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:01,092
It was a good idea.
I was impressed.

709
00:58:02,227 --> 00:58:03,553
Really.

710
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:05,347
Do you want to see something?
really interesting?

711
00:58:05,396 --> 00:58:08,016
I was looking at this
before they arrived.

712
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:12,771
Social networks are
full of support for her.

713
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:14,898
She is suspected of
multiple homicide.

714
00:58:14,906 --> 00:58:17,025
Well, for them it isn't.

715
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:19,778
Now that people know why
what has happened, they support her.

716
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:20,827
Look.

717
00:58:24,082 --> 00:58:26,159
Come closer. There.
What's that?

718
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,786
¿Skid Row?

719
00:58:27,794 --> 00:58:29,579
Why does it look more
sure Bel-Air?

720
00:58:29,587 --> 00:58:31,873
That's strange.

721
00:58:31,923 --> 00:58:33,750
Has it always been like this?

722
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:34,838
You save the data, right?

723
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:37,837
Can you give me a minute?

724
00:59:23,683 --> 00:59:25,135
What's going on?

725
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:26,143
Do you see anything?

726
00:59:28,146 --> 00:59:29,180
I don't see anything.

727
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,073
She's in.

728
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:15,268
OK,

729
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:18,188
so the pattern of crime began
to change about three months ago.

730
01:00:20,865 --> 01:00:22,484
Shit. What's that?

731
01:00:25,411 --> 01:00:28,156
Multiple reports
from an explosion.

732
01:00:28,206 --> 01:00:30,492
Fire. Industrial warehouse,
city center...

733
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:32,577
You stay here. I'll let you know.

734
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:34,704
- Inform me? Where are you going?
- I have a hunch.

735
01:00:34,712 --> 01:00:36,873
But we are not talking about a hunch.

736
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:39,967
That?

737
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:41,237
The radios are turning on.

738
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:42,003
What happened?

739
01:00:42,053 --> 01:00:43,656
A warehouse in the center of

740
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,839
Is it her again?

741
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:45,840
I'll check it out.

742
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,635
Was it on the list of places to
Garcia what did you get from Narco?

743
01:00:48,643 --> 01:00:50,178
- Don't know.

744
01:00:50,186 --> 01:00:51,471
Did you get a list or not?

745
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:54,140
It's... I haven't known yet
none of them, okay?

746
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:55,976
But, I'm on it.

747
01:00:55,984 --> 01:00:58,603
They're probably busy, they're
a lot going on right now.

748
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:01,314
Yes, of course. By the way,
Bigfoot sends his regards.

749
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:04,109
Come on, Moses, it doesn't mean anything.
They're just...

750
01:01:27,682 --> 01:01:28,758
Hey, are you okay?

751
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:31,136
Understand.

752
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:32,345
Hey! Hey, what...?

753
01:01:32,353 --> 01:01:34,931
Hey! Hey! Get out of my car!

754
01:01:34,939 --> 01:01:36,558
Wait, come on!

755
01:01:36,608 --> 01:01:37,767
¡Devuélveme mi auto!

756
01:02:12,143 --> 01:02:13,143
It's them.

757
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:14,728
They caught her.

758
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:21,394
What do you have for me?

759
01:02:21,402 --> 01:02:23,396
Boss, we're done for.

760
01:02:23,404 --> 01:02:24,773
You're sure?

761
01:02:24,822 --> 01:02:26,483
She was in there
when it exploded.

762
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:28,360
There is no way that
survived that shit.

763
01:02:28,368 --> 01:02:29,444
Trust me, he died.

764
01:02:38,253 --> 01:02:40,372
You fools,
are rising in the world.

765
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,260
We will be taking some

766
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,667
Thanks, boss.

767
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:45,168
Now bring your ass

768
01:02:54,185 --> 01:02:55,679
We will be taking
some decisions!

769
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,300
That's a Police.

770
01:03:27,176 --> 01:03:28,587
How do you know?

771
01:03:28,595 --> 01:03:31,035
Who else would be as foolish as
to bring a new car here?

772
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:39,438
Hello.

773
01:03:41,232 --> 01:03:42,684
Can I speak to
you guys a second?

774
01:03:46,529 --> 01:03:47,529
Did you get lost?

775
01:03:50,116 --> 01:03:51,318
I'm looking for someone.

776
01:03:53,077 --> 01:03:55,030
Looking for someone.

777
01:03:55,038 --> 01:03:56,990
Nobody is looking for anybody.

778
01:03:58,249 --> 01:04:00,076
Isn't it dangerous at night?
for children?

779
01:04:02,378 --> 01:04:03,747
No more.

780
01:04:03,755 --> 01:04:04,755
Why is that?

781
01:04:06,591 --> 01:04:08,351
Because now we have a
guardian angel.

782
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:41,952
Is that car following us?

783
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,411
What are you talking about?

784
01:04:49,092 --> 01:04:50,669
I told you to leave that shit,
friend.

785
01:04:50,677 --> 01:04:52,921
- You're getting paranoid.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

786
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:56,967
Shit.

787
01:04:56,975 --> 01:04:58,510
What the fuck is wrong with that guy?

788
01:04:58,518 --> 01:04:59,518
No.

789
01:05:23,293 --> 01:05:24,293
And.

790
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:29,291
Boss, look at this.

791
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:32,294
What makes you think that?

792
01:05:32,302 --> 01:05:35,422
Because I saw her steal the car

793
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,715
And she was angry.

794
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:41,261
Social networks

795
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:45,098
about the vigilant woman,

796
01:05:57,911 --> 01:05:59,196
It's them. Open it.

797
01:06:57,011 --> 01:06:58,011
Turn off the lights.

798
01:06:59,138 --> 01:07:00,138
Stay with the boss.

799
01:08:02,744 --> 01:08:05,822
No, please don't do it.
Please don't do it.

800
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:07,407
I'm not here to hurt you.

801
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:16,666
- He...
- Go, go.

802
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:57,499
Fuck.

803
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:14,314
Fuck.

804
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,152
Don't fucking move!

805
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:31,575
Who the fuck are you?

806
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,617
What do you want?

807
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:34,251
What do I want?

808
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:37,539
I want justice.

809
01:09:38,172 --> 01:09:39,172
Dad?

810
01:09:48,808 --> 01:09:50,343
Come here, baby. Let's go!

811
01:09:53,897 --> 01:09:54,897
Boss?

812
01:10:01,988 --> 01:10:02,988
Boss?

813
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:05,859
Boss?

814
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:08,153
Where is she? Where is she?

815
01:10:08,161 --> 01:10:11,573
It's okay sweetheart.
It's okay. It's okay.

816
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:13,450
Boss, we have to go.
We have to go now!

817
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:14,534
We have to go now!

818
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:08,547
¿Riley?

819
01:11:10,473 --> 01:11:11,800
Good night, Peg.

820
01:11:58,104 --> 01:11:59,764
I remembered the address.

821
01:11:59,772 --> 01:12:02,267
Sorry if we got lost.
the party last time.

822
01:12:02,275 --> 01:12:05,186
Riley, you're crazy.

823
01:12:05,194 --> 01:12:07,355
Everything they said
It is true of you.

824
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,234
Know,

825
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:14,029
I couldn't help but notice,

826
01:12:14,037 --> 01:12:17,157
that you no longer wear a ring
on that finger.

827
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:20,577
He left you, didn't he?

828
01:12:21,753 --> 01:12:24,247
For someone younger,
prettier.

829
01:12:24,255 --> 01:12:25,832
Fuck off.

830
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:33,924
Yes, he...

831
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:36,885
He's gone, okay?
You're right, I...

832
01:12:37,977 --> 01:12:39,221
Please.

833
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,431
This is...
This isn't going to bring her back.

834
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,391
I... I'm so sorry that Carly and...

835
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:44,726
Don't say my daughter's name.

836
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:46,394
Okay. I won't.
They...

837
01:12:49,322 --> 01:12:50,899
You have to lock it up.

838
01:12:50,907 --> 01:12:52,776
You're going to jail
for a long time.

839
01:12:52,784 --> 01:12:54,486
They'll... get you.

840
01:12:54,494 --> 01:12:57,072
This is not...
You don't want to do this.

841
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:03,036
- Thank you.
- I'm going to...

842
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:05,163
burn your house down now, Peg,

843
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:07,415
with you inside it.

844
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:09,292
GOOD.

845
01:13:10,093 --> 01:13:11,461
Riley.

846
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:13,588
Riley! Come back here, Riley!

847
01:13:13,596 --> 01:13:15,799
- ¡No!
- Stop screaming, Peg.

848
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:17,384
- I was just joking.
- ¡Riley!

849
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:19,636
¡No!

850
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,096
¡Riley!

851
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:41,575
Moses.

852
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,493
- I have the information you wanted.
- Dime.

853
01:13:45,044 --> 01:13:49,040
Okay, this place is owned by
a foreign company from Belize.

854
01:13:49,048 --> 01:13:50,417
So, any number
of imbeciles it can be...

855
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:51,835
This is Diego Garcia's house.

856
01:13:51,843 --> 01:13:53,044
Hey, I'm just saying.

857
01:13:53,052 --> 01:13:54,462
Understand,
Have you seen Carmichael around?

858
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,506
I can't communicate
with him on the phone.

859
01:13:56,514 --> 01:13:57,954
It's not my turn to
keep an eye on that guy.

860
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,177
Hey, asshole.

861
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:02,554
If you see him, tell him to call me.

862
01:14:02,562 --> 01:14:04,514
- I'm a little worried about him.
- Understood.

863
01:14:04,522 --> 01:14:05,557
Hey, Barker.

864
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,392
Barker.

865
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,311
What the fuck is this?
What's happening in Narcotics?

866
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,437
¿Carmichael ha estado
trying to get?

867
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:11,563
A list of the
Garcia's locations...

868
01:14:11,571 --> 01:14:13,356
of you and you put it off?

869
01:14:13,364 --> 01:14:15,567
Do you have someone trying to
protect that son of a bitch?

870
01:14:15,575 --> 01:14:17,485
- Wait, Moses...
- No, no. Don't give me that "Moses" thing.

871
01:14:17,493 --> 01:14:20,030
I've been trying to call
Carmichael all damn night.

872
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:22,741
- That?
- Yeah.

873
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,701
Calls, text messages,
emails.

874
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:26,745
I even passed by his
desktop twice.

875
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,831
We have been trying to coordinate
with him since this started.

876
01:14:29,839 --> 01:14:31,679
Who told you not to?
did we call back?

877
01:14:33,593 --> 01:14:34,593
He did it.

878
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:50,518
I think it's another police officer.

879
01:14:50,526 --> 01:14:53,021
Where are your reinforcements?
What took you so long?

880
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:55,023
Sorry, they're a little behind.

881
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:56,031
What do you have?

882
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:57,943
I've been snooping around a bit.

883
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:00,577
Look what I found.

884
01:15:01,913 --> 01:15:03,448
Damn.

885
01:15:03,456 --> 01:15:05,075
The truck neither
it wasn't even closed.

886
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,244
You'd have to be crazy to leave
a vehicle in this neighborhood.

887
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:09,621
But without a key, with a
arsenal in the back?

888
01:15:09,629 --> 01:15:11,269
People have too much
fear of stealing from him.

889
01:15:12,924 --> 01:15:14,251
I don't think it's fear, Stan.

890
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,257
It's not a software problem that
makes this area low crime.

891
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,551
It is a low crime because of her.

892
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,636
So how do you want to do it?

893
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:27,430
Put surveillance,
arrest her when she returns.

894
01:15:27,438 --> 01:15:29,641
- We can catch her alive.
- ¿Viva?

895
01:15:29,649 --> 01:15:32,686
Obviously he has been watching the
Garcia's operation for weeks.

896
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,187
Only God knows what
that has been discovered.

897
01:15:34,195 --> 01:15:36,982
We make him talk, we catch him
to him, to his suppliers,

898
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,316
everything and everyone.

899
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:40,527
If the rumors are true,

900
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:42,946
Garcia has someone
giving you tips from within.

901
01:15:42,954 --> 01:15:44,906
And she has come closer than
what we will never do.

902
01:15:44,914 --> 01:15:46,241
I'm going back to the office,

903
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:48,243
I will coordinate the interagency, the FBI,

904
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:51,288
DEA, Los Angeles Police,
and Internal Affairs.

905
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,707
Hey, Inman, I have to tell you something.

906
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,042
- Yes, what?
- I'm sorry.

907
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,282
I know where to find her.

908
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:28,533
Stay where you are.

909
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:29,951
Gather your people.

910
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:32,078
Tell those idiots that it is
time to earn your money.

911
01:16:33,838 --> 01:16:35,874
I don't care if we have
to burn the city.

912
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,084
But this shit ends
tonight. Understood?

913
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,373
Let's bring these sons of bitches.

914
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,791
I have someone in the
emergency center.

915
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,043
Any call from this area
will be directed through it.

916
01:17:20,051 --> 01:17:21,253
We have to do it quickly.

917
01:17:23,638 --> 01:17:25,340
Is this smart?

918
01:17:25,348 --> 01:17:26,174
We are advertising
ourselves.

919
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:27,842
I don't know if he's here yet.

920
01:17:27,892 --> 01:17:29,261
If she is here,

921
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:30,269
we will find her.

922
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:32,229
Okay, let's go.

923
01:17:41,197 --> 01:17:42,232
Hey! Get up!

924
01:17:44,617 --> 01:17:45,617
Get out of here.

925
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:54,369
Check over there.

926
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:48,590
Mami.

927
01:18:53,269 --> 01:18:54,971
Mami.

928
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:56,806
You have to wake up, now.

929
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,362
We have something here.

930
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:12,155
Warehouse, west of the alley.

931
01:19:12,163 --> 01:19:13,323
Let's go.

932
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:52,487
Talk to me, guys,

933
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,366
Did they find her?

934
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,160
Maybe so.

935
01:20:19,647 --> 01:20:20,647
Shit.

936
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:22,691
Man down.

937
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:58,386
Cortez, we heard gunshots.

938
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,520
Cortez.

939
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,651
Listen to me.

940
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,277
Get out of here.

941
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:16,404
Leave these people alone.

942
01:21:16,412 --> 01:21:19,616
Just give me Garcia and go.

943
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,993
Or I swear to God,
I'll kill everyone and...

944
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,578
to each one of you.

945
01:21:23,586 --> 01:21:24,746
Your choice.

946
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:25,789
He's lying!

947
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,674
I can hear the pain in your voice.

948
01:21:37,308 --> 01:21:38,308
You are suffering.

949
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,512
You are suffering a lot.

950
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,848
Without people, with fewer weapons.

951
01:21:43,856 --> 01:21:45,600
How do you think this is going to turn out?

952
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,358
I'm going to shoot you in
the fucking face.

953
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:55,485
And then I'll think about it from there.

954
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,153
See you soon.

955
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:13,935
He contacted the Agent

956
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:16,631
- She doesn't answer me either.
- Shit.

957
01:22:17,348 --> 01:22:18,800
We have to find her.

958
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:21,219
Let's see if we can get the
Inman's cell phone location.

959
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:23,221
Find out where he went last time
who called a tower.

960
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:24,306
Yes, I already got ahead of you.

961
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,807
Hey, I'm Special Agent Li.

962
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:28,252
I need the location
from a mobile phone.

963
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,978
I'm Barker from Narcotics.
Special Agent Lisa Inman.

964
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,189
I need a Stingray pickup truck
immediately, in the Los Angeles area.

965
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,734
- 323555-9357.
- What? Yes, yes, right now.

966
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,558
Where is the remote control?

967
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:09,851
Where is the remote control?
for TV?

968
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,419
- Where is the remote control?
- Here.

969
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,232
- I'll show you right now.

970
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,274
Look.

971
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,277
OK.

972
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:20,362
Summer,

973
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,614
That guy is a corrupt policeman.

974
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:23,698
Son of a bitch.

975
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,868
That scum over there...

976
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,453
That's Diego Garcia.

977
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,956
He is the man who killed

978
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:36,878
If you have a news team,

979
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:38,755
And if you have a mobile phone...

980
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:40,658
and if you want to come and take videos,

981
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,217
And if they are the Los Angeles Police,

982
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,720
this is where the party is.

983
01:23:45,728 --> 01:23:48,265
I'm not going anywhere.

984
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:49,975
I'm Riley North. I'm on Skid Row,

985
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:52,477
I'm on the corner of

986
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:53,937
- We have a location!

987
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,272
Let's go! Let's go!

988
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:57,983
Let me go! Let me go! No!

989
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:00,986
- Detente.
- Understand.

990
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,071
Come on, buddy. He's just a kid.

991
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,450
You're in this.
You've always been in this.

992
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,084
You want to get out,

993
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:10,666
just nod your head.

994
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:15,333
No, you're right. I'm in.

995
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:21,006
Maria!

996
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:23,258
Hey, there's going to be a dead whore soon,

997
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:25,343
can you hear me?

998
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,512
I have someone here
that I want you to know.

999
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:28,680
Say your name, darling.

1000
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:32,976
Tell him your name.

1001
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:35,312
My name is Maria.

1002
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,356
Maria, here,

1003
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:41,193
is about to die, because of you.

1004
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:45,030
Damn. Looks like you don't have
Good luck with the little girls, huh?

1005
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,205
No! Stop!

1006
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,290
I'm going to count to five.

1007
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,877
Then I'll blow his fucking head off.

1008
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:01,637
A...

1009
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:03,639
¡No!

1010
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:05,724
Of the...

1011
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:10,680
Maria.

1012
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:11,723
Three...

1013
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,193
Four...

1014
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,355
I'm on my way. I'm on my way.

1015
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,399
The SWAT team is ten away
minutes behind us.

1016
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:22,734
Forget it. We're not going to wait.

1017
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:39,876
Drop the gun!

1018
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:53,765
Is it her?

1019
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,021
Are you okay?

1020
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:01,398
I knew you would save me.

1021
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,566
I already knew it.

1022
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,067
You were right.

1023
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,193
Here I am.

1024
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:07,619
Let her go.

1025
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:19,958
You have to go now, Maria.

1026
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,251
You have to come with me.

1027
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,627
- I can't. I wish I could.
- ¡No!

1028
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,963
- Get her out of here. Come on.
- Just go. Take care of yourself.

1029
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,631
No! Please!

1030
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,217
¡No!
No, let me go! Please!

1031
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:30,302
Let me go!

1032
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,102
¡No!

1033
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:34,306
Detente.

1034
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,232
Are you afraid of me?

1035
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,747
This is when you put one
of your lackeys to shoot me?

1036
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:00,916
Coward.

1037
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,001
Don't want to get your hands dirty?

1038
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:06,762
Lift her up.

1039
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,875
- I'm waiting.
- We have to get out of here.

1040
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,309
He's playing with you.
Making time.

1041
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,977
- Just get it over with.
- Shut up, damn it!

1042
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:22,270
Let me have some fun.

1043
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,275
¡No!

1044
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:33,532
You hit like a girl.

1045
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:39,586
Jesus.

1046
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:43,333
Do you see that?
He's not playing for shit.

1047
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:51,716
I must say that I am
a little disappointed.

1048
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,718
I thought you were going to put up a real fight.

1049
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:54,926
Make it fun for me.

1050
01:27:57,897 --> 01:27:59,015
Do you want to hear a secret?

1051
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,063
You should have
listened to Carmichael.

1052
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:13,071
Los Angeles Police.

1053
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,573
Drop your weapons.

1054
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:17,541
Police!

1055
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,296
Police!

1056
01:28:24,048 --> 01:28:25,333
Police!

1057
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,543
- You sold me out, you bastard.

1058
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,722
They can't get through here.
Stay back.

1059
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,730
Hey, hey!

1060
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:45,736
Muévanse! Muévanse!

1061
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:10,128
Get out of my damn way!

1062
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,480
¡Riley North!

1063
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,941
Back off! We got it.

1064
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,817
We'll take care of him.

1065
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,736
How did they do last time?

1066
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:36,571
No, he's not going to escape.

1067
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:38,156
Just drop the gun.

1068
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:43,328
¡Riley!

1069
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,454
Get down on the ground!

1070
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,958
Don't do it.
I beg you.

1071
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,004
Please, Riley.

1072
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,673
You're completely crazy.

1073
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:57,842
You will spend more time
in prison than me.

1074
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:02,013
We are not going to prison.

1075
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:09,521
Stop the fire!
Stop the fire!

1076
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:11,446
Fuck!

1077
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,205
Where is she?

1078
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,553
Aerial, aerial, what do you see?
Do you have anything in sight?

1079
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:45,682
Negative. Negative.

1080
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:49,895
A total disaster.

1081
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,980
It could be anywhere.

1082
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,274
We will establish a
perimeter of ten blocks, but...

1083
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:55,483
Who knows?

1084
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:56,985
Don't bother. I know where this is going.

1085
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:47,869
I've missed them.

1086
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:50,455
I have missed them so much.

1087
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:52,958
I miss you so much.

1088
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:05,394
Riley.

1089
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,390
My husband.

1090
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:10,100
My daughter.

1091
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,312
They are waiting for me.

1092
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,148
Please let me die now.

1093
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:18,400
I can't do that.

1094
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,488
This is not where
the story ends.

1095
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:27,951
It is for me.

1096
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,090
I need a doctor! Now!

1097
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:01,776
Thanks. So Riley North

1098
01:33:01,784 --> 01:33:05,155
popular heroine, common criminal,

1099
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,657
Public opinion seems to

1100
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,701
but the law may disagree.

1101
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:13,038
The Los Angeles Police's position

1102
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:15,207
By Chief Matthew Rogers.

1103
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:18,835
The position of the Department of

1104
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,546
Riley North will be held accountable

1105
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,966
And will be judged by multiple

1106
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,600
Questions?

1107
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:33,350
How are you? Detective Beltrán.
I'll take over for a while.

1108
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:35,060
Why don't you take it?
a cup of coffee?

1109
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:36,235
OK.

1110
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:48,539
Hola, Riley.

1111
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:52,751
Do you remember me?

1112
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:56,964
How do you feel?

1113
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:04,089
You killed a lot of very bad people.

1114
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:08,593
You finished an operation
massive drug rush.

1115
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:13,181
You exposed dirty bastards,

1116
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:14,599
in my own Department.

1117
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:21,273
There is no police
that I know that...

1118
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:23,782
Well,

1119
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:28,238
Let's say that some of
we would wish...

1120
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,286
that things did not have
to end like this for you.

1121
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:40,132
GOOD...

1122
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,798
I hope you get better soon.

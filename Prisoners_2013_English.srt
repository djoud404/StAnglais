1
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,710
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

2
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,210
"Your kingdom come, your will be done."
On earth as it is in heaven

3
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,510
Give us today our daily bread
And forgive us our sins

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,510
"As we forgive those who trespass against us"

5
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,770
And do not lead us into temptation
And save us from Satan

6
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,400
"For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory."
From now on and forevermore

7
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,490
"Amen"

8
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,850
Do you know the most important thing your grandfather taught me?

9
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,690
Be prepared

10
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,620
due to hurricanes or floods
or any other disaster

11
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,330
When the food runs out of stores
Grocery stores and gas stations are running low.

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,420
...and a dispute arises between people, and

13
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,670
Suddenly the only obstacle will be
Between your life and death is your own behavior

14
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,930
I am proud of you, son.
That was a good shot.

15
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,780
Okay, come on, dear.

16
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,530
Hey, hey
I forgot to bring something.

17
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,030
(Wait a minute, Anna

18
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,660
Ralph, did you bring the deer?
Okay -

19
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,160
I forgot the pie

20
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,750
Are we going to ride the truck?
We'll just cross the road, you idiot.

21
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,800
this is -
Wait for your mother please -

22
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,560
Can you give me a call?
Come here -

23
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,020
You became heavy

24
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,020
Danny's father said that
He might sell me their old car.

25
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,400
I have half of what I need from what I saved
From my summer work

26
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,980
...and I thought you could-
Forget it -

27
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,780
He barely makes me money from my carpentry work.
enough to pay the mortgage

28
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,570
Why don't you rent out my grandpa's old house then?

29
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,040
As I always tell your mom, it's a building.
It's old and would cost a fortune to restore.

30
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,180
Okay, okay

31
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,890
They have arrived

32
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,470
Welcome

33
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,850
Happy Thanksgiving -
Happy Thanksgiving -

34
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,520
For God's sake, Keller.
Please enter here

35
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,280
Keller, did you bring the deer you shot?

36
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,030
This time Ralph did it.
You killed him, so you have to take him to the kitchen.

37
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,530
Good -
Thanks -

38
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,030
Happy Thanksgiving

39
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,660
Thank you, Happy Thanksgiving

40
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,080
(Okay, Joy, Joy
I told you 3 times

41
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,380
Joey, get your blood off the table.
You will miss the match

42
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,460
(to come), (to come) -
Hello, how are you? -

43
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,960
Welcome
Happy Thanksgiving

44
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,880
Anna, come here

45
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,090
We have to wait until
We're invited in, understand?

46
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,350
Well, you're responsible for this.
We are like disappointed butchers

47
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,850
No problem

48
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,600
Can I go out with Joey?

49
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,060
If you convince your brother to go
With you, you can go

50
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,940
Good

51
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,780
And please, put on a hat.
You will overcome the cold

52
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,530
Joey, you too wear a hat.

53
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,240
I felt sorry for that deer.
When did you shoot him?

54
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you feel pity for cows?
When you go to McDonald's?

55
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,960
That's what my dad told me.

56
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,290
Deer give birth to many young ones.
And those little ones are starving anyway.

57
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,210
We have to reduce their numbers.
That's right, your father said that too?

58
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,010
Pull more -
Stay away from that thing -

59
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,970
Let me see this -
Come on, let's go -

60
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,390
no -
I said, let's go -

61
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,310
Stop, you can't take things.
Just another person

62
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,810
Let's go -
No, let me-

63
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,400
Let's go, come on, come on

64
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,820
Hey, did you hear that?
There is someone inside

65
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,650
Well I don't want anyone
To shout at me, let's go

66
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,200
Let's go
Not on Thanksgiving, okay?

67
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,840
And now the school committee
They told me there was no

68
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,460
enough money to buy an outfit
New uniform for the infantry division

69
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,960
These children are wearing
same uniform

70
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,050
What we were wearing while we were there
It was already old.

71
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,300
It's a 1979 style.

72
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,850
Why won't he talk to me?
He doesn't talk -

73
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,770
(His name is (Cutie Pie-
Oh, my God -

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,190
It's fast -
Very fast, is this a sled?

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,900
Thank you, thank you all.
I have a surprise

76
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,610
I will play whatever you request

77
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,370
Okay -
no -

78
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,410
You should listen to this because it's not easy.

79
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,000
My mother
Can I take Joey home?

80
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,500
Why?

81
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,750
My red whistle
You will help me find it.

82
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,840
Oh dear, I think the whistle
Alhambra was lost a while ago

83
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,380
What whistle?

84
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,640
Emergency whistle that
My dad gave it to me. I lost it.

85
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,220
133 days ago

86
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,310
Well, if you want to find the whistle
You should whistle for her.

87
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,310
So we'll sing a song
The bells jingle for us to find

88
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,610
Bells are jingling, Batman stinks.
Robin laid an egg

89
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,870
Batman's vehicle is missing one of its wheels.
The Joker was able to escape... Well done!

90
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,830
Okay, okay -
You can go -

91
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,830
Just ask Ralph.
May I come with you please?

92
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,920
Don't search the basement -
I won't -

93
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,250
Your eardrums are still
It's growing and I don't want to destroy it yet.

94
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,380
I'll play any song you want, Killer.

95
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,220
I? -
It's your day and you can ask -

96
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,220
play the piano
no -

97
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,100
No, no, no -
Ready?

98
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,140
Hey, look he's always loved the singer.
Springsteen) wearing the same dress

99
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,680
truly? -
(Yeah, I love Springsteen-

100
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,270
(Remember the song (The River
And Jersey Girls?

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,690
Well, I'm not white.
But I also love him very much.

102
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,690
I'm so drunk
I can't sing the leader's songs

103
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,190
Thank you

104
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,940
What else, dear?
Nothing comes to mind, nothing -

105
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,610
I know -
What? -

106
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,530
He really loves the anthem.
American National

107
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,700
I know, I know, he sings it in the bathroom.

108
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,290
I don't do that

109
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,330
Yes, you do.
I'll play it for you-

110
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,400
Where are your sisters?

111
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,610
I didn't find them

112
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,490
Did... did you go home with them?
No, what are you talking about?

113
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,080
A while ago?
no -

114
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,710
What? They should have left early.
To take you, didn't they come to take you?

115
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,790
No, we haven't seen them since we ate.
decent -

116
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,340
Don't worry, they're probably at our house.

117
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,810
Anna? (Joy?)

118
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,230
Anna)?)

119
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,900
Hey girls?

120
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,760
Hey girls

121
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,170
Who put the plates here?

122
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,050
You weren't out
And it started to rain

123
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,140
Have you looked by Mary's swing?

124
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,680
Okay

125
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,850
Okay, we'll scold them.
When you come back here

126
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,560
Sorry, Grace.
But I will shout at the two girls

127
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,560
What do you say they weren't there too?
You must be home.

128
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,060
Did they come here?

129
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,020
No, they're not here.
Weren't you there?

130
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,650
No, you weren't home.
No, you weren't there.

131
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,990
And I searched the house
All of them are not here

132
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,570
recreational truck
Which recreational vehicle?

133
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,660
There was a truck
You two are playing on it, Dad.

134
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,120
We thought someone was in it.
Where? Where was it? Show me -

135
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,380
Wait here, I'll search.
Around the house again

136
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,880
...Calm down

137
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,210
go this way
We'll meet you on the other side.

Anna)?) -
Joy)?) -

139
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,140
Roger, did you see my daughter passing by?
No, is there a problem?

Anna)?)

141
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,400
Here, Dad, it was.
The truck is parked here.

00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,530
(to come)? (to come)?)

143
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,950
Hello, hello -
Do you see them?

144
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,740
no -
Welcome -

145
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,620
I didn't find them

146
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,330
Were you playing in this house?
no -

147
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,830
I told you not to come here-
We didn't -

148
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,420
They were playing on top of the truck.
Entertainment, and We sent them down from above it

149
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,090
Tell me everything you can remember.
About that recreational truck

150
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,960
everything -
It had a ladder in the back.

151
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,800
Hey, police please

152
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,060
Happy Thanksgiving

153
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,070
Thanks

154
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,820
Do you have any cakes?
Little luck?

155
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,610
My manager told me that men
Police don't like fortune cookies.

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,950
What year of the Chinese zodiac were you born in?
Are you a Dragon, Snake or Horse?

157
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,660
I am a monkey
You are a monkey

158
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,000
You are very smart
You have the ability to influence people.

159
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,170
Maybe you can influence your manager.
To reduce the account a little

160
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,130
No, I can't.
My manager is a rooster

161
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,020
So he is selfish and weird.
...this

162
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,360
To all units, a vehicle has been spotted.
"Entertainment to specifications"

163
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,110
The vehicle was spotted parked in one of the
Rest stops on Route 46

164
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,830
Located north after exit 17
Are there any units available?

165
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,160
Here the 12-12 periodicity responds to the signal" -
Patrol 10-80 responds -

166
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,210
Period 13-40 I'm 5 minutes away
I will meet all units that responded.

167
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,520
Periodical 12-12 Get Ready
Patrol 10-80 ready -

168
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,400
Journal 13-40
I'm in place, we'll move carefully

169
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,610
You, don't move

170
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,450
Beware

171
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,830
Don't shoot, don't shoot
Don't shoot

172
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,090
Okay, Sloane.
Take the right

173
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,550
maternal uncle

174
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,020
It's empty

175
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,320
Okay, wait, wait.
I'll take care of it

176
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,610
give me this

177
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,050
You

178
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,550
See you here
Show me both your hands now

179
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,550
You, I see you raise your hands

180
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,600
Show me both of your hands, now.

181
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,360
So slow, slow, slow
both hands

182
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,070
Both of your damn hands

183
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,740
Oh my, oh my.

184
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,740
Wait

185
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,870
Amish

186
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,370
Get up, get up

187
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,620
Get up

188
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,290
Show me where the girls are?
Show me where you hid the girls?

189
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,380
Where are the girls?

190
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,960
Where are the girls?

191
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,760
Give me a flashlight

192
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,010
Where are the girls?
Are they in the forest?

193
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,800
Did you take them to the forest?

194
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,180
Where did you put the girls?

195
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,270
Do you hear me?

196
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,560
What is this guy on?

197
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,570
Yeah, he's on something-
Put that damn thing in the car-

198
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,280
Get in the damn car, walk

199
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,240
Call the Pennsylvania State Police.
Tell them to bring the sniff dogs.

200
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,910
They closed the whole area.

201
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,620
Good -
The entrance and everything -

202
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,120
Good -
And you, come with me -

203
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,630
Why don't you play on top of your RV?
both -

204
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,260
Well, take a look at them again.
Don't you recognize these two girls?

205
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,430
I didn't see them, may I sit?

206
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,350
What do you do in a recreational vehicle?
Answer my question

207
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,520
I sleep in it
You sleep in it

208
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:31,060
Were you sleeping in it that day?
Why did you park your car in front of that house?

209
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,360
I was driving it around.

210
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,990
Were you driving it around?
But you weren't driving it.

211
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,450
I know for sure that the two girls
They were playing outside your truck.

212
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,080
You weren't driving it, it was parked.

213
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,450
Was this a special day?
Did you plan to kidnap the girls?

214
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,370
no -
Have you done that before?

215
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,870
no

216
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,090
Did you ask them to get into the car?
no -

217
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,090
I asked them to come in.
To the cart and then took them?

218
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,420
no -
Did you put the girls in a place?

219
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,470
May I sit down?
Did you put the girls somewhere?

220
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,680
Don't touch me
I know you put the girls somewhere-

221
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,970
Did you hide them?
no -

222
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,020
Where did you hide them? Did you tie them up?
Did you tie them?

223
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,650
You, you

224
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,110
Listen, I know you're a good man, okay?
I know you are a respectable man

225
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,150
I'm not trying to accuse you of committing a crime.

226
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
I'm just trying to get the answers.
Right from you, okay?

227
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,950
Real answers, that's all I want.

228
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,490
Where to park your truck
Usually entertaining, Alex?

229
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,620
At my aunt's house
At your aunt's house

230
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,290
Let me park it in the back garden.
where the grass no longer grows

231
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,840
It belonged to my husband.
It's for sale if you want it.

232
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,140
No thank you

233
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,720
Okay, can you tell me what you're doing?
On my own property then

234
00:18:53,770 --> 00:19:00,320
I'm just glad I knew where he was.
He always comes home before dark.

235
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,820
I don't understand

236
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,820
That boy didn't get into trouble.
Throughout his life, not once

237
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,330
In the summer he sleeps outside
...on the bed of the cart, but

238
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,750
At this time of year he sleeps
Here on a folded bed

239
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,590
This is my husband

240
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,220
We had a fight
About... five years ago

241
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,180
He went out and never came back

242
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,230
(Alex), I love him like a father.

243
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,780
Where are Alex's parents?

244
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,450
My husband's brother and his girlfriend
They died in a car accident.

245
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,950
(When Alex was
At the age of six

246
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm sorry to hear that.

247
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,050
He doesn't have much.

248
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,350
What did you find?
This truck is clean.

249
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,890
I mean it's so dirty.
But we didn't find anything in it.

250
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,440
Didn't we find any wool fibers?
Or anything like that?

251
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,230
One of the girls might have been wearing a glove.
Or a wool hat, didn't you find any cotton fibers?

252
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
Well, I might believe he used it.
This vehicle is for transporting girls.

253
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,950
But if you resist him
I would find something

254
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,570
If I were you, I would search
In the forest next to the rest house

255
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,750
Yes, half officers.
The state is doing it now.

256
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,040
When you're done checking this thing out
Would you send the crew to Auntie's house?

257
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,480
(to come)

258
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,950
(to come)

259
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,230
(Please come in, I'm Franklin Birch.
My wife is here

260
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,610
(Darling... this is Nancy

261
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,610
Detective Loki is... dear.

262
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,830
These pictures are better
From the one my husband gave you

263
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,040
You can see her eyes more clearly.

264
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,820
Did we succeed?

265
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,490
Excuse me, what did you say?

266
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,330
The thing about lying, the lie test
What we took this morning, did we succeed?

267
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:55,290
Yes, yes, excuse me
Yes, we appreciate your cooperation.

268
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,340
It's embarrassing, all that fuss.

269
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,430
Everyone will think we're crazy when you come out.
The two girls from their hiding place wherever they were

270
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,850
Do you have a reason to?
You think they ran away?

271
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,060
No, they are happy.

272
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,280
But they must have run away.
I guess they must have run away, right?

273
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,830
The police captain told me you solved everything.
The cases you were assigned, is that true?

274
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm sorry

275
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,970
...I'm really sorry, did you
Do you have children, Detective?

276
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,650
I will find your daughter

277
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,280
We think they came here.
After they left the Birch house yesterday

278
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,160
They were searching
About Anna's Red Whistle

279
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,450
Yes, I read your statement.

280
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,540
(I am Detective Loki

281
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,170
I am heading the investigation into your daughter's disappearance.
Please have a seat.

282
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,430
My son already told you that the person who
He was in the truck watching them, wasn't he?

283
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,350
We did not find any physical evidence in the truck.
Recreational or at his aunt's house where he lives

284
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,640
nothing?

285
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,270
Unfortunately, Alex Jones has a low average.
intelligence of a ten-year-old child

286
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,030
It is impossible for a person with such an IQ to
10-year-old boy kidnaps two girls

287
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,400
In broad daylight and then make them
Somehow they disappear

288
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,820
Well, how can he drive?
So the recreational truck?

289
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,870
I mean, if he can't answer a question,

290
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,580
He has a valid license.
(To drive from Pennsylvania

291
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,960
But he tried to escape, didn't he? They said.
He tried to escape.

292
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,750
Why...why did he try to escape?

293
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,380
I just spent 10 hours
In interrogating that boy, shall we?

294
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:18,140
I understand your point very well -
Did you make him take a lie detector test?

295
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,140
She subjected us to a lie detector test.
Did you subject him to it?

296
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,520
Sir, I understand what you are trying to ask of me.
And yes, we did.

297
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,640
We gave him a lie detector test.
...and it was impossible

298
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,020
Lie detection is useless if it is
The person does not understand the questions

299
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,690
Well, maybe he wasn't alone.

300
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,410
How can he drive a recreational vehicle?
If he had the IQ of a 10 year old?

301
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,200
Sir, we are considering all possibilities.
I don't think you're thinking of all the possibilities -

302
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,370
I understand your meaning, sir.
No, just listen to me -

303
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,620
Just shut your fucking mouth for a second.

304
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,380
This is what I want you to do for me.
I want you to calm down

305
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Please hear me out for a second.

306
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,760
Mr. Dover, I understand perfectly well.
This is a very difficult time.

307
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,300
But I made all the police officers
(In the state they are looking for (Anna

308
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,970
I don't understand what any of this means.
But they said he tried to escape.

309
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,310
They said he tried to escape.
I didn't understand why he tried to escape?

310
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,690
We are thinking of all possibilities.
(Mr. Dover

311
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,990
I understand what you mean
I won't cross anyone off my list.

312
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,830
Just... let me do my job.

313
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,670
Your Honor

314
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,930
Damn

315
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,760
It will remain reserved.
Until my daughter is found, right?

316
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,890
Isn't that right?

317
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,940
We can hold him for 48 hours until tomorrow.
This is if we do not prove any charge against him.

318
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,400
So, accuse him of something, accuse him.

319
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,690
Mr. Dover, I understand your suffering.
Your Honor, Your Honor -

320
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,110
Two little girls definitely deserve it.
To break the rule for them

321
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,740
to put that bastard in custody

322
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,070
Now I know you can't
Promise me anything, I understand.

323
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,700
But I ask you to be careful.
%to be 100% sure

324
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,750
Thank you
I appreciate that.

325
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,340
Now, you are sure he is innocent.
But you want to keep it here.

326
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,300
Anna Dover's father was hateful.
Towards me in the morning

327
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,420
I understand and appreciate that.
But it won't happen

328
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,930
You know, all I ask is one day -
Damn you -

329
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,550
No no

330
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,520
When you find his daughter he will forgive you
If you don't, he'll hate you anyway.

331
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,480
What next?

332
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,520
I kept knocking on doors all night.

333
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,230
Yes this is what happens when you have
Missing for 24 hours and no evidence

334
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,320
I have 3 sex offenders.
(Within 10 miles of Fairmont)

335
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,820
So if you don't mind

336
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,320
Go -
Okay -

337
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,420
It's right here.

338
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,930
Listen to me, I'm straight.
Good?

339
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,010
It's not... I didn't
...Listen, I know you

340
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,520
Well, do you enjoy some?
German porn movies?

341
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,350
...Listen, I was just

342
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,720
Open up, father
I am from the police

343
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,050
Father

344
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,980
Father

345
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,020
Do you mind if I look around?

346
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,930
drunkard

347
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,030
What is this?

348
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,410
Amazing

349
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,170
Damn

350
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,650
Damn it

351
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,350
No, please don't, God.
What is your friend's name down here?

352
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,900
What's his name?
I don't know his name -

353
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,190
Don't you know his name?
I don't know his name -

354
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,320
Did you know that I worked 6 years in prison?
Events in Huntington, Father?

355
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,070
Learn about juvenile detention
In Huntington, right?

356
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,490
Hurt a lowlife like you
It is a real pleasure for me.

357
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,700
Why don't you tell me his damn name?
He refused to say his name.

358
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,500
He came to confess, saying he killed 16 children.
He was proud of it.

359
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,920
I convinced him to come here.
When he said he would kill more

360
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,670
16 children?
Let's go, you bastard.

361
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,870
Welcome -
They will release him.

362
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,040
What? -
That man -

363
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,050
The police announced
They will release him today.

364
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,010
Okay, I'll take care of it.

365
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,430
my dad? -
Keep searching -

366
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,930
Where are you going?

367
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,440
You must write your full name.

368
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,780
This is good

369
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,700
Well done
Now give it to the man.

370
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,090
Okay, let's go.
I don't want you to care about those people.

371
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,260
Don't talk to them, there is no
What you tell them, let's go

372
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,610
Come on Alex, you took
The two girls, right?

373
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,120
my lord -
I just want to talk-

374
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,620
He is a free man and I am a free man

375
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,000
Tell me what you did with them?

376
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,420
Tell me -
They didn't cry until I left them.

377
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,250
What did you say? What did you say?
No, no, no, no

378
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,920
Stay away from him

379
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,670
Stop

380
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,430
to retreat

381
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,060
please let's go
We are fine, thank you

382
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,860
I knew your father when he was a guard.
(in Graterford prison

383
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,280
I also have a daughter
So I'm going to pretend it didn't happen.

384
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,200
(Well? And as for Alex Jones
He has an order not to leave the country.

385
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,790
What?

386
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,460
Sir, I want you to go home.
What did I just tell you?

387
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,960
Why didn't you send anyone?
To catch that bastard?

388
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,760
Tell Detective Loki what you told me.
I just sent it to him and he will definitely look into it.

389
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,260
Come on tell him

390
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,390
That shit you promised to keep
In detention, okay?

391
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,890
And she didn't do that

392
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,890
Tell me now when you catch him
In the garage

393
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,600
He said the words to my face
They didn't cry until I left them.

394
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,400
He said the words to my face -
He told you that in the garage just now?

395
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,780
Now, yeah like I said in the garage
Cars, before you pull me off him.

396
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,410
Anyone else hear that?
I don't know he was talking in a low voice-

397
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,830
He was talking to me
He wanted me to know.

398
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,740
Are you sure he said that?
What? -

399
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,420
Are you sure that's what he said?
Come on, do you think I'm making that up?

400
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,540
Absolutely -
Why would I invent that?

401
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,420
No, I don't think about it.

402
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,750
Why would I invent that?
I didn't say you did that-

403
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,970
I was just asking you a few questions.

404
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,340
I'll talk to him, okay?
No, don't talk to him.

405
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,800
Mr. Dover
Catch him

406
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,140
What did I ask you?

407
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,810
What did I ask you?
All I asked for was one more day.

408
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,190
Are you sure you didn't say anything to Mr.
Dover) in the garage today?)

409
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,860
Anything I might have misunderstood?

410
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,870
I was there, neither of them said anything.
To the other, but the man attacked the boy

411
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:21,120
You didn't say anything like, get away from me?
Or help me? Anything like that?

412
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,380
no

413
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,510
May I speak alone?
To Alex for a minute?

414
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,350
It's okay, my love
I'll be in the next room.

415
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,740
You love your aunt
Isn't that right, Alex?

416
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,490
Okay

417
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,710
Do you know if you know something you haven't told us?
She might go to jail for a long time?

418
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,880
Do you want that to happen to her?
After everything I've done for you?

419
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,670
no

420
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,730
Mr. Dover, this is Detective Locky.
Did you catch him?

421
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,030
Listen, I just got out."
From Alex Jones' house

422
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,900
And he told me he didn't say anything to you.
In the garage

423
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,490
I pushed him too hard.
to speak, but he didn't budge.

424
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,830
So we can't waste any more.
Time for this boy

425
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,330
Good?
You have to trust me

426
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,040
I'll let you know as soon as I find anything.
(New Mr. Dover

427
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,130
You bastard

428
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,310
Her coat zipper was broken.
And I told her it didn't matter.

429
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,600
Because we're just crossing the road.

430
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,690
No no -
Why haven't you come home yet?

431
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:18,700
It's been 3 days
Why can't you bring her back home?

432
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:26,330
I don't understand, I don't understand
It's been a long time

433
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,870
Please, bring her home.

434
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,170
Please bring it -
How many, how many of these?

435
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,300
How many did you take?
I don't know -

436
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,970
Okay, that's okay, take one.

437
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,220
Take it

438
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,850
no

439
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,720
I just want to sleep

440
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,560
I just want to sleep

441
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,110
You

442
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,820
you make me feel safe

443
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,370
You told us you could.
Protect us from everything

444
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,750
Oh my God

445
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,040
I will go out to help the police
In search, take care of your mother

446
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,970
Your sister needs us
To be brave for her

447
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,090
Be brave for her, and be mature.
For me, can you do that?

448
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,060
Can you do that?

449
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,470
I know you're scared
Look at me, come here

450
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,850
I know how scared you are

451
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,770
everything will be okay

452
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,790
The past is the reason why
"One must be motivated to be patient.

453
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,750
The reason for his repentance is the coming
"For what he may suffer from distress

454
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,760
"This reminds him that his problems and troubles

455
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
They are the logical conclusion that
It should be expected to happen in this world.

456
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,100
Man was created with his problems.
"Not as a mere human being, but as a sinner

Hey, hey, Tucker!

Bells are jingling, Batman stinks.
Robin laid an egg

461
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,140
Batman's vehicle is missing one of its wheels.
The Joker was able to escape.

465
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,080
That song, where did you hear the lyrics?

466
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,610
Did you bring extra clothes like I asked?

467
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,780
Yes, would you tell me why?

468
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,740
I'd better show you-
Show me what?

469
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,470
Haven't you lived here before?

470
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,280
Close and lock the door

471
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,090
Amazing

472
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,280
Oh my, what have I done?

473
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,990
Keller, what the hell is this?

474
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,580
I heard him sing the same song.
that they sang at Thanksgiving

475
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,750
I swear, Franklin, same song.
And I told you what he said in the garage.

476
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,540
So, let's take him to the police.
No, no, no, the police won't do anything.

477
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,130
Because he'll just pretend to be crazy.
As he did last time

478
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,800
Someone has to force him to talk.
Someone did that

479
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,350
Damn man, this isn't right.
I mean, what if I'm wrong?

480
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,100
(You're not wrong, Franklin, really.
No, no, wait, what if I'm wrong?

481
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,480
What if you could hear what you wanted?
...just hear it? What if

482
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,610
Man I want my daughter back
Just the way you want it

483

(Oh Franklin, oh Franklin-
This is not right -

484
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,570
We have to hurt him until he talks.
Otherwise, both girls will die.

485
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,870
...this is not-
No no -

486
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,120
We have to hurt him until he talks.
Otherwise, both girls will die.

487
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,330
That is our choice.

488
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,340
This is the choice
What you should do

489
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,630
and I made my decision
Because I know what I heard

490
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,010
He is no longer human

491
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,060
No, he stopped being human.
When he took our two daughters

I need your help

493

This is your last chance, I know you
Scared and want to go home

494
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,500
Well, I don't want to, I don't want to.
To hurt you, I don't want to

495
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,920
I will remove the tape.
And I want you to tell me where they are.

496
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,960
You, come on

497
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,220
Have you seen my glasses?

498
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,810
What? -
I can't see -

499
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,560
If you don't talk, Alex
I will be forced to hurt you

500
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,150
Tell me where they are?

501
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,740
Yes, I'm in front of the house.
(Located in Fairmont)

502
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,990
That house that was
The RV is parked in front of him.

503
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,950
It was put up for sale a few months ago.

504
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,160
I will track down the owners to find out.
If they know anything

505
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,450
Is there any new information about?
The body we found in the priest's cellar?

506
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,750
We did not find a match with the DNA.
Dental records and fingerprints

507
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,040
nothing? -
The priest also sticks to his story -

508
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,800
Good

He took the two girls, I'm sure of it.

511
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,340
The tape started to deteriorate.
I think so

512
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:04,300
I watch it every day after breakfast
It's the only video I have of him.

513
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,140
That was too soon for you.

514

26 years ago
On August 19

515
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,650
I took a nap in the afternoon and when
I woke up and Barry was gone.

516
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,820
No one could tell me what happened to him.
He was playing in the front yard.

517
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,530
A few feet away from the place
where they said the cart stopped

518
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,080
What do you think that means?

519
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:44,710
I'm more eager to know what you think it means.
I don't think we'll ever know what happened-

520
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:53,680
(It's just like what happened to Barry.
Nobody took them, nothing happened.

521
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,520
They just disappeared.

522
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,900
How are you, Dad?

523
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,950
I was better off

524
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,580
Detective Schminsky told me
You have some details

525

About the crimes that claim
That man committed it

The kidnapper

527
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:30,300
He...was waging war against God.

528
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,430
Awesome! This is awesome!

529
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,560
I thought you said he knew certain things?

530
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,100
Tell him how he took the children.

531
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,190
He said

532
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,740
He was taking them in broad daylight.

533
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:01,450
And sometimes... more than one child
at a time

534
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,460
He said that?
Okay -

535
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,500
Did he say someone else was with him?
Or was he alone?

536
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,510
He said he has a family.

537

That's all?

538
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,980
Okay

539
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,940
Well, this was very informative.

540
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,660
I said they cried when I left them.

541
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,830
Look at me, I said
They cried when I left them.

542

I said they cried when I left them.

543
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,420
Now tell me, where is she?

544
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,890
Tell me where they are?

545
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,770
Just tell me, tell me and I'll stop.
I'll stop as soon as you tell me.

546

...only
Just tell me where they are?

547

Why don't you tell me?

548
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,720
Why don't you just tell me, you bastard?

549
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,570
He knows, he knows

550
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,400
I can see it in his eyes.
He knows

551
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,620
I know you know
Why don't you tell me then?

552
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,330
Why?

553
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,000
Good

554

Stop, stop

556

You will force me to use this.

557

Will you tell us?
If you don't I'll use this.

Good

You are the one who is to blame yourself

Just tell us
Tell me

561

01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,690
"It's where I go to be alone."

610
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,370
What music do you listen to?
"And you're in your truck alone?

611
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,500
"...radio, tape"

612
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:03,210
"Your truck is parked in Fairmont?"
"No, is my aunt coming?"

613
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,050
"...I, I, I, I, I, I"

614
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:13,770
"Have you seen these two girls?"
"no" -

615
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,520
Take a look at them
"Have you seen these two girls?

616
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,020
"no"

617
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,940
Did you participate in any way?
"In kidnapping these two girls?

618
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,530
"no" -
Loki! You have a call.

619
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,040
Good

620
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,670
I called you as soon as I saw"
"Drawing of the suspect on TV

621
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,420
He comes to visit us every week.
"Almost buys children's clothes

622
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,210
But he always buys clothes.
Different sizes

623
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,510
I caught him playing with a doll.
One-time model

624
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,130
How to pay?
Cash

625
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,970
Okay, call me if you hear anything.
We agreed -

626
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:06,230
Five days have passed
Maybe they haven't drunk water since then.

627
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,990
Tonight might be our last chance.

628
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,410
Look, I'll call you.
After Nancy goes to sleep, okay?

629
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,620
I promise you

630
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,610
Where have you been all this time?

631
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,390
What in heaven's name are you thinking?

632
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,570
Did you tell anyone?

633
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,710
I would like to see it

634
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,230
please help me

635
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,570
Can you help me find my little daughter?

636
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,780
I have a picture

637
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:12,330
Look?
This is my structure

638
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,040
Do you see it?
(Her name is Joy

639
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,720
...and...this

640
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,260
Her doll that we bought for her when she was
In the second, because she was afraid to sleep alone

641
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:38,730
Please tell me where my building is.
Please tell me where my building is located.

642
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:49,450
I know you'll tell me
I'm sure you will

643
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,220
Help me

644
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,680
Help me

645
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,180
"...Franklin, did you close the door to..."

646
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,600
(Nancy)

647
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,610
What do you do?

648
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:30,320
Damn it!
Damn it

649
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:34,530
Let go, let go

650
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,120
Did you undo his bonds?

651
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:55,800
That was close.

652
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,300
What's up? What happened?
Bring Franklin, I want to show you something.

653
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:49,100
Did he say anything new?
He will say soon, you will see -

654
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,280
No light enters it

655
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,330
barely enough room to sit

656
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,330
The laundry is still working.
But we control it from the outside.

657
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:15,000
I messed with the water heater.
So the water will come out either burning or freezing.

658
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,010
We will talk to him through this.

659
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:25,430
It's a reminder for us, just in case.
As soon as we started feeling sorry for him

660
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,060
Oh, my God

661
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,690
I can't hurt him anymore without killing him.
So this is the only way.

662
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:38,730
Are you out of your mind, Keller?
Got a better idea, Franklin?

663
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,820
Do you have?

664
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:45,950
Go ahead and take it out if you want.
I won't stop you

665
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:49,700
If that's what you really want, take it out.

666
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,080
Do you think anyone cares about life?
The two girls are as full of his life?

667
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,170
I hope so

668
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,920
Five days have passed, my friend.
Time is running out

669
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:05,890
You don't even know he's the culprit.

670
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,390
Yes, I know -
No, you don't know.

671
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,470
Know -
I know you, you don't know -

672
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:18,690
Look, I want my daughter back.
(As much as you miss Anna

673
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:24,820
Regardless of what you think of me
I am ready to sacrifice my life for my daughter

674
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:30,160
But this is not true.
It must end

675
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,370
Well, then it should
You can start working

676
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,630
We can start with that wall over there.

677
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,850
(Franklin)

678
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,940
to stop

679
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:13,120
(Franklin)
Think of Joy

680
01:11:53,610 --> 01:12:00,200
I need to get out of here, Ralph.
Everything in this house makes me want to vomit.

681
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,580
"Your father's building?"

682
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:10,710
It is impossible for me to stay in the house
This high, it's disgusting.

683
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,930
"Yeah, okay."

684
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,490
We won't help Keller.
But we won't stop him either.

685
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,750
Let him do what he needs to do.

686
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,670
I don't know what to do about it anymore

687
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,570
Eliza?

688
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,070
Eliza?

689
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,580
Sorry -
Eliza?

690
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:34,790
Eliza, open the door.

691
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,300
Eliza?
Is she in?

692
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,510
My dear?

693
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,180
Get out of the way, get out of the way

694
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,680
Yeah, screw you both.

695
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,470
If you intend to leave me here alone again
At least tell me where you're going.

696
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,500
Ralph?

697
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,550
Anna)?)

698
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,100
Anna)?)

699
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,730
Anna)?)

700
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,200
My mom?

701
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,080
Mom, what are you doing?
Anna, Anna was here.

702
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,620
Mom, it's freezing here.
Mom, mom, mom, sit down please

703
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,460
Stop, calm down
I will close the window

704
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,800
"And she wasn't here"

705
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:55,760
Then I heard a voice from my room.
When I entered, I found the window open.

706
01:15:55,890 --> 01:16:03,980
It was not open before
...then (Ralph), came in

707
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:06,520
...and looked, then

708
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,700
Then... I don't know

709
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,780
Won't you write this down?

710
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,220
The basement, I didn't check it.
We should check the basement.

711
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,340
I'll show you, I'll show you

712
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,560
The two girls know that it is forbidden to go down here.

713
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,820
You're not supposed to come down here.
But I'm not sure

714
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,220
My husband loves
to be prepared for emergencies

715
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,600
Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?

716
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:32,980
I was going to ask you about him, he's going out
(To search with the police for (Anna

717
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,320
This is what you should do now.

718
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,740
Does he always stay outside?
Even this late?

719
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:45,370
Yes, he is still searching until this hour.
About my daughter as long as she is missing, yes

720
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,080
Damn

721
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:16,210
You, turn around.

722
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:28,430
Damn

723
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,140
(Come on, Mr. Dover

724
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,400
Damn

725
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:43,040
Why are you following me?
Get in the car

726
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,100
Why are you following me?

727
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,640
Where did you go now?

728
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:08,770
I parked my car at a liquor store.
and I bought a bottle of alcohol

729
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,110
You are a genius detective
Think of a solution

730
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,570
I actually meant that before

731
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:19,910
You were going in the direction
Opposite through parking lot

732
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,790
(Towards Campello Street

733
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:34,840
Yes, I didn't drink alcohol.
Nine and a half years ago

734
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,180
I realized that if I walked
Around the corner for a while

735
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,590
Maybe when they open
My craving for alcohol goes away

736
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:45,220
Then I saw you, that helped me
To make up my mind somewhat

737
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,360
There is a bag of sodium hydroxide.
In your basement and half of it is used

738
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:00,950
Your wife thinks you're helping us.

739
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,620
But you and I know that this is not true.

740
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,500
I used sodium hydroxide.
To bury our dog last year

741
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,380
And resorting to police help seems better.
saying i'm driving around aimlessly

742
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,460
Because I don't know what else to do

743
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:21,510
Is that what you were doing Saturday night?
Most likely, am I a suspect?

744
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,720
No, I'm asking you because of a man.
I attacked him before, he is missing now

745
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:31,600
I heard about that, what happened to him?
I thought he was under your control

746
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:34,350
I'll assume you're addressing this to me.
The question is because you don't know anything.

747
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,520
I didn't consider kidnapping a crime.
A man could commit it and get away with it.

748
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,520
This is correct

749
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:42,200
Yeah, couldn't he have left town?
Because he's a lowly sinner, isn't that possible?

750
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,450
Because that would mean
It's your fault he ran away, right?

751
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,780
Mr. Dover?

752
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,080
Mr. Dover?
What? -

753
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:57,580
You have to take care of yourself and your wife.
This is the best you can do right now.

754
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,590
That little girl
She'll need you when she gets home.

755
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:11,390
Children who are missing for more than a week
The probability of finding them is 50%.

756
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,100
After a month of missing them
They are often not found.

757
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:16,850
They're not alive, okay?
So forgive me for trying my best.

758
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,060
You know something?
It hasn't been a week yet

759
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:20,570
You're right, we're on day 6-
It did not pass

760
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,230
Good -
Day 6 -

761
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:27,700
And every day that passes
You wonder why I can't save her.

762
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:29,240
Good -
Do you understand that?

763
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,280
Me, not you
I'm the one you're wondering about

764
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:34,290
Daily!
Good -

765
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:38,370
So forgive me for not coming back.
home for a good night's sleep

766
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:44,420
Why don't you search now?
About my daughter instead of arguing?

767
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:49,010
Don't follow me -
Enough, enough

768
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,930
Mr. Dover, Mr. Dover

769
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:01,020
Don't think I'll let you drive.
The car after I got drunk, right?

770
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:03,820
I will walk
As for you, look for my daughter

771
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:51,610
"Dad, Dad"

772
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,450
"Look, Dad, we found it."

773
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,750
Anna, where was she?

774
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:49,080
"Grateford guard commits suicide in his home"

775
01:26:58,150 --> 01:26:59,530
I'm not Alex

776
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:04,200
What are you saying?
What? What?

777
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,240
"I'm not Alex"

778
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,580
Wait a minute, you're not Alex? What?

779
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:16,120
I'm not Alex
Wait a minute, I don't understand-

780
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:21,880
Just talk to me -
I waited for him and he didn't come

781
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:25,470
Hey, no more puzzles.
Just tell me

782
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:33,020
I'll let you go back to your aunt
If you tell me where they are

783
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:40,610
I just wanted to play
Don't make me do it again -

784
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:42,980
And he did not come
Don't make me do it-

785
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:50,660
...He never came, but I wished -
Why do you make me do this?

786
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:10,800
help me god

787
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:23,020
I call upon you, O mighty one, O merciful one
O You who promised forgiveness, forgive my sins.

788
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,310
Damn me

789
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:08,070
No noise, shut up, make noise
And I will open that tap

790
01:29:57,570 --> 01:29:58,990
I wake up

791
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:08,420
I won't find two girls here, will I?
Damn you!

792
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:18,720
What about Alex Jones?
What about him?

793
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:23,720
I came here for a drink.
I don't want to drink in front of my wife

794
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:28,390
Look, my father left
I have this building, okay?

795
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,150
Would you mind taking me for a tour?

796
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:48,790
Why didn't you tell me about this place?
I didn't think it mattered.

797
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:51,250
Everything matters

798
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:00,050
The whole building is dilapidated like this.
I will restore it soon

799
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:03,260
Yes, not organized.
Like your basement, right?

800
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:13,100
What's up with the survival gear over there?
Pray to God for the best, and prepare for the worst -

801
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:15,520
I think we agree on that, right?

802
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:19,150
Hey, hurry up!

803
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:55,140
Damn

804
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,810
Welcome?

805
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:07,030
The man you're looking for was just here.
He saw me watching him, so he ran away.

806
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:08,910
Do you know the license plate number?

807
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:15,870
Okay

808
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,750
Okay

809
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,630
Okay

810
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:27,130
Go home, Mr. Dover.

811
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,160
Welcome

812
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,410
Good morning

813
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:11,670
Why did you run away from me that night, my friend?

814
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:15,470
I've never seen you before

815
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:18,600
Are you sure?
That you went to the right house?

816
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,430
Have you done some shopping?
At Value Mall recently?

817
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:25,600
Okay

818
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:31,740
Why? Is shopping there a crime? No.
I can buy the suits from the Brooks Brothers.

819
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:40,490
Yes, I know.
You bought baby clothes.

820
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:45,830
truly?
I must have been in a hurry.

821
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:55,510
Do you have children?
no -

822
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:01,640
i have nothing

823
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,690
For God's sake

824
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,190
Give me your damn hand

825
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,040
If you move, I'll pass.
A bullet through your damn head

826
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:49,600
"Here" 40-13
I need an additional unit for inspection.

827
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:52,900
Address: 437 Carroll Street, possibly
Two kidnapped girls found in the house

828
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:48,200
Anna, really)
Anna, (Joy)?)

829
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,710
Damn

830
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:29,420
Damn

831
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:47,860
We took pictures of some of the clothes.
which we found in the suspect's house

832
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,900
Mr. Dover

833
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,030
Mr. Dover, is your wife here?

834
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,870
You won't come

835
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,540
Well, if you can't do an actual recognition,

836
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:54,800
On any of these pictures
I'll need her to come over and take a look.

837
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,390
Have a seat

838
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,820
So he confessed, he said he killed them?

839
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:24,240
We hope he's lying, but we haven't found any.
...any bodies, Mr. Dover, but

840
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:31,960
The British family got to know
On two pieces of clothing already

841
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:37,550
I want you to tell me
If you recognize anything

842
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,190
no

843
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:14,410
I'm not sure, I don't know

844
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,370
Good

845
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,130
no

846
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,010
no

847
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:51,370
this

848
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,080
This is her sock

849
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,480
I...wasted time

850
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:30,570
You wasted time chasing me.

851
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,500
I let it happen.

852
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:23,620
Don't talk to them

853
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,090
Eliza told me they were dead.

854
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:38,340
Is this real?
no -

855
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,600
She said they found
Their clothes were stained with blood.

856
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,600
Don't tell your mom that, don't you
You dare to tell your mom, okay?

857
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:47,270
Now I want you to listen to me.

858
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:51,900
I would like you to stay home for a few days.
And be careful not to let her watch the news.

859
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:54,230
And if the newspapers came
Throw it away, listen to me

860
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:57,360
We will not lose hope in your sister, we will not

861
01:42:59,030 --> 01:43:02,030
I will find her and bring her home
We will not lose hope

862
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,330
Will you bring her home?
She's dead, there's nothing you can do.

863
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:08,210
You're leaving me and my mom here
While you go out and get drunk

864
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:11,290
Do you think I don't smell alcohol on you?
Be quiet -

865
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:37,280
How long has Bob Taylor been in business?
On this map?

866
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,860
Three and a half hours

867
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:43,870
You think that'll lead us to the bodies?
Because I assure you that will not happen.

868
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:45,950
Do me a favor, Captain.
And stay away from me

869
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:49,000
We do not reach any conclusion from his interrogation.

870
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,170
More of a maze than a map.
He has a penchant for mazes.

871
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:03,930
I will go home
Call me if anything happens

872
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:50,010
Give me that card, Johnny.
key card

873
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:01,690
Okay, I'm done now.

874
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:09,320
tell me what to draw
You said you were drawing a map.

875
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:11,820
This looks like a damn puzzle.
tell me what to draw

876
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:19,160
tell me what to draw

877
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:24,960
I can't-
...yes you can, you can-

878
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:30,050
Damn it!
...yes you can, you can-

879
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,640
Take it, come on -
...yes you can-

880
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:35,140
Yes he can.
Oh, damn it!

881
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,310
!Pistol! Pistol! Pistol

882
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:38,850
Bob, don't you dare!
Put down the weapon

883
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,940
(Bob), (Bob) -
Put down your weapon

884
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:45,820
(Bob), (Bob), (Bob), (Bob)
No, no, no, no

885
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:49,570
Damn

886
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:53,740
Call a resident guide

887
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:58,870
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be your name

888
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:06,750
Your kingdom come, your will be done
As in heaven, so on earth

889
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:12,800
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our sins

890
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,640
As we forgive

891
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:27,020
As we forgive

892
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,920
Did he explain this before he committed suicide?

893
01:46:56,130 --> 01:47:01,890
I'm sorry -
Damn your regret, save it for the girls' parents -

894
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:10,810
I don't know what to do, Alex.
I don't know what to do anymore

895
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:15,480
The worst thing is that I'm sure
That you know where they are

896
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:21,030
I think we're done

897
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:30,460
They are in the maze

898
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:36,840
There you will find them -
What? What did you say?

899
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:45,470
In the maze -
Which maze?

900
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,310
Where is it? Where is the maze?
Where can I find it?

901
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:53,310
Alex?
Alex, Alex, listen to me.

902
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,110
I'll get you out of here, okay?
Just tell me where the maze is.

903
01:47:57,570 --> 01:48:02,700
That's all, tell me, man -
Where is the maze?

904
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,530
Hey, tell me where the maze is, okay?

905
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:15,170
Hey, don't mess with me now.
Tell me, for God's sake

906
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:19,800
tell me where they are
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

907
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:27,600
Something will make you talk
There must be something that will make you talk.

908
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,890
Something will make you talk

909
01:48:51,790 --> 01:48:53,160
One minute

910
01:48:56,870 --> 01:49:01,960
How do I help you? -
Good morning ma'am, I'm Keller Dover.

911
01:49:02,090 --> 01:49:06,590
my little daughter
She was kidnapped with her friend

912
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:10,550
What do you want?

913
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,640
I guess I didn't look closely.
Think about it carefully

914
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:23,570
I thought a lot
About what happened to your nephew

915
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:28,240
I know I scared him a few days ago
At the police station

916
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:34,490
What I'm trying to say is, I feel
Responsible for his escape

917
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:40,870
Would you like to come in?
Okay -

918
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:55,680
My husband and I were very pious once.

919
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:01,980
We spent the summers
We drive that truck with our son.

920
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:08,440
As we were distributing brochures
We spread the word of goodness

921
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:17,490
After our son died of cancer
We started to see things differently.

922
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:23,960
Adopting Alex helped us.
But we have not overcome our sadness

923
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:27,210
I'm sorry

924
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:36,140
You look so tired -
Yeah, I don't sleep enough.

925
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:44,190
I keep dreaming that I'm lost in a maze

926
01:50:48,230 --> 01:50:54,320
Sorry, Alex doesn't talk much.

927
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:56,410
So when guests come to me
I hardly know what to say

928
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:58,990
He doesn't talk much?
Okay, he's talking, you get me-

929
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:03,370
Good morning, have a nice night
It is difficult to get other words out of it.

930
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:11,670
He had an accident when he was young.
Then he began to choose his words carefully.

931
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:14,760
What kind of accident did he have?

932
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:18,130
My husband domesticated snakes.

933
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:22,310
What happened wasn't that bad.
...but Alex was afraid of her, and

934
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:29,440
This is not a pleasant memory -
Sorry, that's none of my business-

935
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,530
But... Shall I bring you...
A cup of tea, Mr. Dover?

936
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:43,200
Taylor commits suicide, and the place
The two bodies are still unknown.

937
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:47,910
I'm so sorry, I thought you knew that.

938
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:50,830
In my opinion, this is better.

939
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:56,300
That horrific man would have spent years in prison.
Those sentenced to death watch TV and get fat

940
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:05,720
At least I don't have to worry anymore.
(From missing you in Pennsylvania Police

941
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:17,150
Once the forensic doctors are finished
From his home, we will deploy body tracking dogs.

942
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:22,700
Look, we can't save
The situation is always the same?

943
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:25,280
We are just policemen, guards.

944
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,120
So you lost this time, okay?

945
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:34,500
If you want an achievement, find a girl
He started a family and had some children.

946
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:36,630
Forget it

947
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:00,040
Good

948
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,920
Yes? -
Hi, I'm Rich, we found something-

949
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,180
Let's take a look

950
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:23,940
Two children's clothing mannequins
Their heads are pierced.

951
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:29,490
I just spoke to our lab mates, and they told us:
The blood in the plastic containers comes from pigs.

952
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:34,110
Okay, cover them.
It's going to snow soon, hurry up, okay?

953
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:40,370
As if he is playing some role
I mean it's a case in point.

954
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,910
Except for the elements that define
(عليها آل (دوفر) و(بريتش

955
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:46,290
All the baby clothes we found
It still has the manufacturer's badge.

956
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:49,090
The Book of Labyrinths
What we found settled the matter.

957
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:51,710
Photocopies and pictures of this
The book we found in the attic

958
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,260
A former FBI agent wrote it.
Finding the Invisible Man

959
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:59,600
Yes, it's about the theoretical suspect who is believed to be...
He is responsible for a child kidnapping gang.

960
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:03,270
It's a totally unbelievable theory.
I guess, but I read some of it.

961
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:06,850
Taylor was kidnapped as a child.
He fled after 3 weeks.

962
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:10,400
The kidnapper drugged him with a binary mixture.
Lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine

963
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,320
He didn't remember anything.
They did not catch the culprit.

964
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:17,860
Well, he read the book and decided.
He was kidnapped by the invisible man.

965
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:20,410
And now he's imitating him better.
What he can, right?

966
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:26,500
Yes, he imitated it as best he could.
He committed suicide last night.

967
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:30,710
How did he commit suicide?
I thought he was under arrest.

968
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:42,810
Taylor) drew this
It's a map of the two bodies, I assure you.

969
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:45,810
We found the same design on a necklace.
We pulled it from a corpse days ago.

970
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:47,350
There's a connection, okay?

971
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:51,650
The connection is that it is the last maze in the book.
It is not solved, there is no way out of it

972
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:54,690
The two bodies belong to another imitator who read the book.

973
01:55:56,110 --> 01:55:57,990
What do you mean, Rich?
What do you mean?

974
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:03,280
That this man is fake and that the two girls
Are you still alive somewhere?

975
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:05,540
Where did Bob Taylor come from?
On those clothes?

976
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:11,330
How did the parents know about those clothes?

977
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:16,550
I can't explain this -
You can't explain it?

978
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:19,090
Just keep investigating.

979
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:22,390
Hey, why is this here?
put it in a bag

980
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:53,430
Yes?

981
01:57:56,350 --> 01:57:58,980
Yes, this is it.

982
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04,730
What?

983
01:58:07,150 --> 01:58:08,530
Oh, my God

984
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:14,910
Wait, is that it?
(Ralph), (Keller)

985
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:34,430
Keller, we have to go to the hospital.
They found Joy, but they didn't find Anna.

986
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:40,140
Maybe she knows where Anna is.
(Please, we have to go, Keller.

987
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:47,190
Eliza) Don't answer) -
You should write to her -

988
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,690
Okay

989
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:59,740
No one is allowed to pass -
Don't touch me

990
01:58:59,870 --> 01:59:01,910
Ma'am, wait a moment -

(Grace) -

992
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:06,920
They will find Anna
I know they will.

993
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:11,130
Know -
How is she?

994
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:12,760
Is she awake?

995
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:18,100
Joey, how far are you from our street?
How far off the street did you get, Joey?

997
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:22,180
You can't do this now -
How long did it take you to get there?

998
01:59:22,310 --> 01:59:24,270
Let me ask a question please -
(Keller) -

999
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:26,900
The detective will be back in a minute.
You have to wait

1000
01:59:27,150 --> 01:59:29,020
She's drugged.
(Joy) -

1001
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:34,570
Dear, let us know that
Just alive, okay?

1002
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:38,530
Can you nod, baby?
Just nod

1003
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:44,330
Can you give us a nod?
Please, Joy?

aerial)?)

1005
02:00:02,930 --> 02:00:05,180
Complete all the mazes and you'll return home.

1006
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:34,210
I was there -
What? Where have you been?

1007
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:38,760
Put two strips of tape over our mouths.

1008
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:46,180
Take it easy, my little one
decent

1009
02:00:47,390 --> 02:00:51,270
Your mom and dad are here, okay?
you are fine

1010
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:53,900
Sorry -
you are fine -

1011
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:58,530
I said no one is allowed in the room.
Except her family... where are you going?

Keller)?) -
Wait, where's he going?

1013
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:03,070
I don't know -
You -

1014
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:05,320
Call downstairs
Don't let him out

1015
02:01:05,450 --> 02:01:07,700
You, you -
Block the exits

1016
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:09,200
Wait

1017
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:13,460
Stop that car
His truck

1018
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:15,080
Stop, wait

1019
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,570
I know your destination

1020
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:05,270
Hello again

1021
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:09,940
Hi I was hoping you would let me do this.
Something to atone for my sin

1022
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:12,860
What sin?

1023
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:16,740
The sin of scaring you a few days ago
At the police station

1024
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:21,660
You already apologized for that -
...I know, I thought maybe you had-

1025
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:28,840
You might benefit from some help, I noticed that
Your door needs repair, so I brought my equipment.

1026
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:32,670
Understood

1027
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:38,100
I burned myself
I'm feeling a little crappy today.

1028
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:43,560
But I'm glad you want to talk more.

1029
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:48,310
No need to make excuses
Come in and make me a cup of tea.

1030
02:03:58,280 --> 02:03:59,660
Enter

1031
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:21,090
I don't want to hurt you

1032
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:25,560
I know they were here.

1033
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:30,400
Put your hands on your head and turn around.

1034
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:34,070
Do this

1035
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:38,950
I'll just go

1036
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:43,870
Do not touch this bag
Put your hands above your head

1037
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,420
Come here to this table
this is

1038
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:05,640
Open the top drawer

1039
02:05:15,190 --> 02:05:16,560
Handcuff them

1040
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:33,210
You don't know me, Mr. Dover, but believe me.
When I tell you I won't let you go

1041
02:05:42,130 --> 02:05:47,760
You don't have to drink it all, a third.
It will do for a man your size.

1042
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:52,890
This is something that makes you more malleable.
Forget it -

1043
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:57,020
Drink it, Mr. Dover.
Or I will kill you right away in my kitchen

1044
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:59,730
And bring your daughter to gather
Your brains are off the ground

1045
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:01,230
Where is she?

1046
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,360
Drink
Just let me see it -

1047
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,070
Want to see it?
Okay -

1048
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:12,990
This is your ticket to your daughter.

1049
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:27,050
(A little more, Mr. Dover.
A little more

1050
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:38,310
Delicious right?
It's my dear husband's recipe.

1051
02:06:46,570 --> 02:06:49,740
Now, go back out -
Let me see it -

1052
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:57,330
Take it out of your pocket

1053
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:01,790
put it in the sink

1054
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:06,300
Put it in the drain

1055
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:17,140
Leave your car keys on the table.

1056
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:22,940
Put your car keys on the table.

1057
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:26,730
I did well

1058
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:31,400
Go to the truck over there
The car is over there, go over there

1059
02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:33,360
Move over there

1060
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,710
The look on your face

1061
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:47,710
My husband had the same look.
(Until we kidnapped Alex.

1062
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:50,340
He was the first child we kidnapped.

1063
02:07:50,590 --> 02:07:53,630
His real name was Jimmy or Barry.

1064
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:58,600
I don't remember, and I doubt it.
The other remembers, what more names

1065
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:03,180
(I had forgotten about Bobby Taylor.
until I read about it in the newspaper

1066
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:07,600
Get in the driver's seat

1067
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:19,320
Open the door and get into the car

1068
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:38,970
Hiding children is war
which we wage against the Lord

1069
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:45,640
That makes people lose faith.
And turns them into demons like you

1070
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:52,810
I've had to slow down since my husband disappeared.
But I'm doing my best.

1071
02:08:55,150 --> 02:08:58,940
Start the engine, start the engine

1072
02:09:05,330 --> 02:09:06,700
keep trying

1073
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,290
Slow down

1074
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:22,180
Hey, back off.

1075
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:26,300
this is

1076
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:32,390
Stop, stop it

1077
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:35,310
Stop it

1078
02:09:37,110 --> 02:09:38,480
Get out

1079
02:09:47,870 --> 02:09:51,950
I think you should know
Alex didn't touch the girls.

1080
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:58,130
I just wanted to take them for a ride in the truck.
I decided that you should stay

1081
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:06,630
Take a look, maybe your daughter is down there.

1082
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:08,850
You never know

1083
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:13,770
(to come), (to come)

1084
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:21,690
Anna)?)

1085
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:24,530
Come), (come)?)
Anna)?)

1086
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:29,490
I hid the two girls downstairs.
When the police came to search

1087
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:35,540
I should leave them down there.
I've been so lonely without Alex.

1088
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:40,170
Scroll down -
What? -

1089
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:42,960
Get down

1090
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:48,840
As long as you want me to come down
You'll have to shoot me.

1091
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:52,600
I won't go down
Just because you asked for it.

1092
02:10:56,850 --> 02:11:01,190
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1093
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:06,280
Come on down

1094
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,700
I did well

1095
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:40,730
Make yourself a stepladder
You may stay alive for 24 hours

1096
02:11:45,940 --> 02:11:49,900
I love being alive
When I throw your daughter's body down

1097
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:58,870
Wait, no, wait, wait, wait

1098
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:02,540
no

1099
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,940
Welcome

1100
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:32,690
I'd like you to go to Holly Jones.
She must be informed.

1101
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:35,990
(No, I have to find Dover-
You're done for in Dover, all right? Please?

1102
02:12:36,110 --> 02:12:38,700
Do you want me to go to Holly Jones?

1103
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:40,200
I would like you to go
To Holly Jones and learn it please

1104
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:13,150
Oh, my God

1105
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:13,710
Oh my great God, protect my daughter

1106
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:28,740
Mrs. Jones?

1107
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:42,460
Mrs. Jones?

1108
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:15,550
Show me your hands now

1109
02:17:16,590 --> 02:17:19,220
Don't move, raise your hands immediately.

1110
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:24,430
Stop immediately and raise your hands
Don't move and raise your hands

1111
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:29,310
Make sure they burn my body
I don't want to be buried in a box

1112
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:32,230
Raise your hands immediately

1113
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:35,610
Damn

1114
02:17:47,330 --> 02:17:50,330
Anna, oh my god

1115
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:12,520
(Oh my god, Anna

1116
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:30,790
Damn

1117
02:18:48,510 --> 02:18:52,850
Come on, come on.
Anna), (Anna), Haya)

1118
02:18:54,770 --> 02:18:57,600
Stay with me, Anna.
Anna, stay with me.

1119
02:18:58,520 --> 02:18:59,900
Stay with me, Anna.

1120
02:19:08,570 --> 02:19:11,570
Stay with me, Anna.
Take it easy

1121
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:13,910
Go, move, move, move

1122
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:24,420
Don't die, don't die

1123
02:19:51,990 --> 02:19:57,120
Take it easy
you are fine dear

1124
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,370
Look

1125
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:04,420
Help, help

1126
02:20:04,540 --> 02:20:08,550
Help, help

1127
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:31,940
Detective Loki?

1128
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:39,120
I hope we're not intruding -
both -

1129
02:20:43,910 --> 02:20:45,290
She's fine

1130
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:50,290
She will be fine in a while.
A few days, right, dear?

1131
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:54,050
She came to thank you and greet you.
You have to be saluted because you are the hero

1132
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:01,180
Welcome

1133
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:12,320
Would you give us a moment?

1134
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:15,030
Good -
Thank you -

1135
02:21:15,150 --> 02:21:16,530
(Say goodbye, Joy-
See you soon -

1136
02:21:16,650 --> 02:21:18,240
I'll get back to you in a minute, okay?
(Say goodbye, Anna-

1137
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:49,560
Did you find her whistle?
no -

1138
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:55,320
She insists that Joy helped her.
To find her on Thanksgiving before they were kidnapped.

1139
02:21:55,980 --> 02:22:00,990
But I think it's confusing.
I bought her another one.

1140
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:20,340
He didn't call me.

1141
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:28,180
I think you probably
You won't believe me, but he didn't call.

1142
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:37,360
I believe you

1143
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:47,570
Do you think you will find it?

1144
02:22:52,540 --> 02:22:56,920
Okay -
And he will go to jail -

1145
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:00,710
This is likely.

1146
02:23:07,590 --> 02:23:08,970
Overall, thank you for everything.

1147
02:23:12,310 --> 02:23:13,680
Lord

1148
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:27,450
i miss him

1149
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:37,540
He did what he had to do to find Anna.
I thank God for that

1150
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:49,380
He is a good man

1151
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:00,440
See you soon

1152
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:26,340
We're done, let's pack up.

1153
02:24:35,050 --> 02:24:36,430
Are you done for tonight?

1154
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,510
Yes, the ground is frozen solid.

1155
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:41,140
We will spend several weeks
In excavating the whole house floor

1156
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:43,730
We found some dead snakes and crap.

1157
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:49,230
Pray for the best
And prepare for the worst, right?

1158
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:52,860
Good night

1159
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:57,240
Good night

1160
02:24:58,200 --> 02:24:59,580
Turn it off

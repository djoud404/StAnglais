1
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,595
When you love someone,
you've gotta trust them.

2
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,560
There's no other way.

3
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:58,274
You've got to give them the key
to everything that's yours.

4
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:02,563
Otherwise, what's the point?

5
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,732
And, for a while, I believed
that's the kind of love I had.

6
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,425
Before I ever ran a casino,
or got myself blown up...

7
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:20,685
Ace Rothstein was a hell
of a handicapper, I can tell you that.

8
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,355
I was so good that whenever I bet,
I could change the odds...

9
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,354
for every bookmaker in the country.

10
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:27,894
I'm serious, I had it down so cold...

11
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,353
that I was given paradise on earth.

12
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:34,613
I was given one of the biggest casinos
in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

13
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:38,993
by the only kind of guys that can
actually get you that kind of money...

14
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:42,833
$62,700,000.

15
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:44,793
I don't know all the details.

16
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:48,461
Nobody knew all the details,
but it should've been perfect.

17
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:52,331
I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro,
his best friend, watching his ass...

18
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:56,341
and he had, Ginger,
the woman he loved, on his arm.

19
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:00,220
But in the end, we fucked it all up.

20
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,300
It should've been so sweet too.

21
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,810
But it turned out to be the last time
that street guys like us...

22
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,679
were ever given anything
that fuckin' valuable again.

23
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,998
At that time, Vegas was a place
where millions of suckers...

24
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:17,988
flew in every year on their own nickel...

25
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,647
and left behind about a billion dollars.

26
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:24,367
But at night, you couldn't see
the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.

27
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:30,367
But it's in the desert where lots
of the town's problems are solved.

28
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,496
Got a lot of holes in the desert...

29
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:35,586
and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes.

30
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,586
Except you gotta do it right.

31
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,586
I mean, you gotta have
the hole already dug...

32
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,586
before you show up
with a package in the trunk.

33
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,464
Otherwise, you're talking about
a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin'.

34
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:48,174
And who knows who's gonna
be comin' along in that time?

35
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:51,094
Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.

36
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,894
You could be there all fuckin' night.

37
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:11,451
Who could resist?

38
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:14,491
Anywhere else in the country
I was a bookie, a gambler...

39
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,450
always lookin' over my shoulder,
hassled by cops, day and night.

40
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:20,001
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.

41
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,870
I'm not only legitimate,
but running a casino.

42
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,840
And that's like selling people
dreams for cash.

43
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,169
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert,
as my manager, and I went to work.

44
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,219
...the casino manager. And this is
Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.

45
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:40,217
For guys like me,
Las Vegas washes away your sins.

46
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:42,347
It's like a morality car wash.

47
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:45,897
It does for us what Lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples.

48
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:54,526
And along with making us legit...

49
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:58,156
comes cash, tons of it.

50
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:01,135
I mean, what do you think we're doing
out here in the middle of the desert?

51
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:04,154
It's all this money.

52
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:06,574
This is the end result
of all the bright lights...

53
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:09,745
and the comp trips, of all the champagne...

54
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:13,465
and free hotel suites,
and all the broads and all the booze.

55
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:18,133
It's all been arranged
just for us to get your money.

56
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,303
That's the truth about Las Vegas.

57
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:25,682
We're the only winners.

58
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:27,682
The players don't stand a chance.

59
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,012
And their cash flows from the tables...

60
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,812
to our boxes through the cage...

61
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,441
and into the most sacred room
in the casino.

62
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,690
The place where they add up
all the money...

63
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:41,190
the holy of holies, the count room.

64
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,490
- Now, this place was off-limits.
- Verify 3,000.

65
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,489
Even I couldn't get inside.

66
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:51,009
But it was my job to keep it filled
with cash. That's for sure.

67
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,949
They had so much fuckin' money in there...

68
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,788
you could build a house out
of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.

69
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:57,789
And the best part was that upstairs...

70
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,148
- the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
- Five thousand.

71
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:02,588
I mean, to them everything
looked on the up-and-up.

72
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:04,588
Right? Wrong.

73
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,588
Verify 5,000.

74
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:08,658
- The guys inside the counting room...
- Five thousand.

75
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,507
Were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.

76
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,726
They'd do short counts,
they'd lose fill slips.

77
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,266
They'd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes.

78
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:19,266
And it was up to this guy right here...

79
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,396
standin' in front
of about two million dollars...

80
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:24,895
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody gettin' wise...

81
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:27,195
- the IRS or anybody.
- Verify 200.

82
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:30,405
Now, notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything.

83
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,784
Somehow, somebody's always
lookin' the other way.

84
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:34,903
Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?

85
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:37,703
They're countin' money.
Who wants to bother them?

86
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:41,373
I mean, God forbid they should make
a mistake and forget to steal.

87
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:44,913
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.

88
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:47,833
Past the jag-off guard
who gets an extra C-note a week...

89
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:50,502
just to watch the door.

90
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:54,552
It's routine. Business as usual:
In, out, hello, good-bye.

91
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:56,551
And that's all there is to it.

92
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,891
Just another fat fuck walkin' out
of the casino with a suitcase.

93
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:04,061
Now that suitcase was goin'
straight to one place:

94
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,851
Right to Kansas City, which was as close...

95
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,980
to Las Vegas as the Midwest
bosses could go...

96
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,359
without gettin' themselves arrested.

97
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,689
That suitcase was all...

98
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,689
the bosses ever wanted.

99
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,029
- And they wanted it every month.
- Hey, John, how was your ride?

100
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:26,078
Now this old Mormon fuck here...

101
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:29,497
he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month, nice and easy.

102
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,076
- Somethin' smells good.
- Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.

103
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:34,286
The bosses would come
from all over the place:

104
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:36,627
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...

105
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,717
all over the Midwest.

106
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:41,757
And they would meet in the back
of this produce market in Kansas City.

107
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,966
I mean, nobody even knew it.

108
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,306
One of the guys made
his mother do all the cookin'.

109
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:48,615
- Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
- Jerry Steriano?

110
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:51,145
Now, these old greaseballs
might not look it...

111
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:52,515
but believe me...

112
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:55,104
these are the guys
who secretly control Las Vegas.

113
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,314
Mama, that man's here again.

114
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,774
Because they control the Teamsters Union.

115
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:02,754
And that's where you had to go if you
wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.

116
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,943
- Would you put in shrimp?
- I would.

117
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:05,692
Here you are, gentlemen.

118
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:08,942
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan
unless the guys in this room...

119
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:11,612
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases.

120
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:15,992
Guys like this antique over here,
out of Detroit.

121
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,871
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit's top boss.

122
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,711
You got a round figure on it?

123
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:25,751
- Definitely the most important guy in this room.
- About 20 pounds.

124
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:29,130
- That's around 700,000.
- Uh-huh, good.

125
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,340
I know it's a little early for Las Vegas...

126
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
But I do want to welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of the gaming industry.

127
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,600
As far as the world was concerned...

128
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,349
Andy Stone, the head of
the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

129
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:44,398
- was a legitimate guy.
- This is a very auspicious occasion.

130
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:46,438
- A powerful man.
- Philip, if you would rise.

131
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,438
He even played golf with the president.

132
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:50,857
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

133
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,467
- it is my pleasure to present to you...
- But Andy also took orders.

134
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:56,487
And when he was told to give
a pension fund loan to Philip Green...

135
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:59,497
this check for $62,700,000...

136
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:02,035
for the new Tangiers.

137
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:04,165
He did what he was told.

138
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,165
Now, here was the perfect front man.

139
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,315
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.

140
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:10,045
He didn't want to know too much...

141
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,924
especially that the bosses made
the Teamsters lend him the money.

142
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:14,674
He wanted to believe the Teamsters...

143
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:17,295
gave him all that fuckin' money
'cause he was smart.

144
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:19,945
I know full well how much competition
we have in this great city.

145
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,683
And where they got Green from?

146
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:27,473
Who the fuck knows?

147
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,993
All I know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler...

148
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,023
who barely had enough gas money...

149
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,313
to come and pick up his own fuckin' check.

150
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:36,362
And of course it was the bosses' man...

151
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,362
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.

152
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:40,821
Not the chairman
of the fuckin' board, Philip Green.

153
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,071
I understand. I understand.

154
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,370
Now all they needed was...

155
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,450
somebody they could trust
to run the casino.

156
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,910
And who better than Ace? I mean, he was
already in Vegas a couple years...

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and he had the fuckin' place clocked.

158
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,668
But typical Ace, give him a shot
at runnin' a casino...

159
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,128
and he tries to talk you out of it.

160
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:03,548
I don't know if I could do this
even if I wanted to.

161
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:05,359
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

162
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,869
I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

163
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,598
You don't have to have a license
to work in a casino.

164
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,728
All you gotta do is apply for one.

165
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:16,097
The state law says that
you can work in a casino...

166
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:18,267
while they're processing your application.

167
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:20,267
They got a ten-year backlog.

168
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,276
What happens when they do find out?

169
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,316
Why would they want to find out?

170
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:27,336
We're puttin' a hundred million into this
desert. Why would they want to lock us out?

171
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:31,236
They'll never find out. All you gotta do
is keep changing your job title.

172
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:35,864
Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

173
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:39,124
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

174
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:42,374
I know guys been workin' there
for 30 years, don't have a license.

175
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,873
It's a tough proposition, Andy.

176
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,833
You know if I did it,
I'd have to run it my way.

177
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:50,713
You got it.

178
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,263
I'm serious, no interference.

179
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:55,672
Nobody's gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

180
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:58,012
I guarantee it.

181
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,602
And that's how they got Ace to take over.

182
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:07,481
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

183
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:12,610
They worked out
a real cute job title too...

184
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,610
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

185
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,124
But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

186
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:22,529
He made his first bet when he was
15 years old, and he always made money.

187
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,119
But he didn't bet like you or me.

188
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,959
You know, havin' some fun
with it, shit like that.

189
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,038
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?

190
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,877
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

191
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:35,127
Place the checks properly.

192
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,087
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,927
He had to know everything, this guy.

194
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,196
He'd find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew...

195
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:43,926
and that's what he'd put his money on.

196
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:46,887
Even back home, years ago...

197
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,887
when we were first hangin' out...

198
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:51,556
he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...

199
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,400
I'll take Columbia for 20.

200
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:55,625
- If his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.

201
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:59,025
He'd get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

202
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:00,945
He even figured out the different bounce...

203
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,005
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used...

204
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,944
on college basketball courts, you know?

205
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,944
He'd be workin' on this shit day and night.

206
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,303
There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn't know.

207
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,783
Ace got down at six. Get me down at six.

208
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,543
Season after season...

209
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,202
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

210
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,212
But he was so serious about it all...

211
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,672
that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.

212
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:23,792
But that's just the way he was.

213
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:26,631
But back then, the bosses
didn't give a fuck...

214
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,720
about whether he enjoyed himself or not.

215
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,720
To them, he was a cash register.

216
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,511
All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

217
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:36,311
Especially Remo...

218
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,730
who was a fuckin' degenerate
gambler who always lost...

219
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,770
Cazzo!

220
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,400
All those fuckin' sweeps.

221
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,399
- Unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!

222
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,489
Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

223
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,698
than I could do heisting
joints for a month.

224
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:54,158
Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

225
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:57,998
I mean, fixed fights, doped horses...

226
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,367
crooked fuckin' zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

227
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,377
He told fuckin' Remo everything.

228
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:06,626
And to tell you the truth,
I don't blame him.

229
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,756
- Hey!
- Keepin' Remo happy with money...

230
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:11,086
was the greatest insurance
policy in the world.

231
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:14,175
Son of a bitch!

232
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:16,175
How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?

233
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:18,555
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi...
How the hell'd you do it?

234
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,595
Well, that's why they paid so well.

235
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:22,685
You see? Never tells me nothin'.

236
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:24,934
What do we got on for next week?

237
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:29,024
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say
Thursday would be good. Is that all right?

238
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:31,944
- Okay, you'll come by the house?
- I'll come by.

239
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:36,023
7:00. Good job, my boy.
Keep it up? Okay, Ace?

240
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,363
Hey, Nick. Vien acca.

241
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,702
- I'll be right out.
- T'aggia parla.

242
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:44,822
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.

243
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:46,831
He's makin' a lot of money for us.

244
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:50,121
And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of
money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

245
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:52,871
Not like your fuckin' friends
out there that... without brains.

246
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:55,211
- Okay?
- All right.

247
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:57,320
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah. Want me to take this for you?

248
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,550
So now, on top of everything else...

249
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,049
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around
with the golden Jew.

250
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,639
Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.

251
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,139
Yeah, we made a great pair.

252
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:11,768
I made book and Nicky made sure
we always collected.

253
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:14,059
The old men loved us, and why not?

254
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,149
- They all made money with us.
- They payin'?

255
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:18,549
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week, like they're supposed to.

256
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,330
- Don't ask.
- And where the fuck is the money? I don't see any money.

257
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,407
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.

258
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:27,237
Who's this guy?

259
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:30,287
- Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine.
- It was eight.

260
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,406
Ace, tell him the line on the Bear game.

261
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:35,576
- Eight.
- If he don't know, nobody knows.

262
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,575
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?

263
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,665
'Cause you're a jag-off.

264
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:41,665
- Excuse me.
- What?

265
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:45,254
- Is this yours? Your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

266
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,314
No, it's a nice pen.
I just didn't know whose it was.

267
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,324
I thought it was yours.
I didn't want it to get lost.

268
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,764
Well, thank you.
Why don't you take that fuckin' pen...

269
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:54,433
and shove it up your ass,
you fuckin' jag-off.

270
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:58,372
- Well, I was just offering you the...
- This fuckin' assho...

271
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,312
Look out, Joe. Look out.

272
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,660
What's that?
You hear a little girl, Frankie?

273
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,290
Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little fuckin' girl?

274
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,289
What happened to the fuckin' tough guy...

275
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:30,499
told my friend to stick it
up his fuckin' ass?

276
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,509
Nicky, take it easy. Nicky, Nicky.

277
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:43,427
While I was trying
to figure out why the guy was saying...

278
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:46,267
what he was saying, Nicky just hit him.

279
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:49,767
No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

280
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,186
You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

281
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:55,736
You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

282
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,316
And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him...

283
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:01,156
because he'll keep coming back and back...

284
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:03,655
until one of you is dead.

285
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:15,293
Listen, with me protectin' Ace...

286
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,123
he made a fortune for the bosses.

287
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:21,503
I mean, that's what got him to Vegas.

288
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:24,463
He was a money machine.

289
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:27,222
A tremendous earner for these guys.

290
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:30,261
As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fuckin' drop.

291
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,181
With Ace, the casino
never saw so much money.

292
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,180
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.

293
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:39,190
# I got $700 #

294
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,190
# Don't you mess with me #

295
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,231
# But you know I'm down #

296
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,109
# Everybody knows I'm down ##

297
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,999
In Vegas, I had to keep
a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

298
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,038
They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

299
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:04,458
I mean, without us, these guys,
they'd still be shoveling mule shit.

300
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,458
Ward, you've got to keep a cleaner space.

301
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:08,627
If you need Mr. Clean, page him, all right?

302
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:10,626
Won't happen again, Sam.

303
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,296
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein. Won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

304
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,386
Is this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what? What's the story?

305
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:19,886
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?

306
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,475
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

307
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:24,565
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

308
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,184
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.

309
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,234
These yokels ran the state.

310
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,894
Thank you very much, Senator.

311
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,064
- They passed the laws, they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace. Hey, I need a room.

312
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,844
- I had dozens of politicians and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.

313
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,789
Coming through that place every week.

314
00:18:38,824 --> 00:18:40,804
- Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.

315
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:43,204
Why not make him happy?

316
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:45,912
...the Presidential Suite.

317
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,421
For politicians like our State Senator
up there, everything was on the house.

318
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,301
These guys won their comp life
when they got elected...

319
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,720
so, hey, why not take advantage of it.

320
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,269
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

321
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,769
It's a whale like K.K. Ichikawa...

322
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,689
who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat...

323
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,859
that's the one you really gotta watch.

324
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:19,228
He plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit...

325
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:21,238
to turn out your lights.

326
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:25,238
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman Islands.

327
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:27,368
Downstairs he takes us for two million...

328
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:31,657
and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.

329
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:34,377
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

330
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:38,497
free private jets and
two million of our money.

331
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:41,006
But we got him back.

332
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,545
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

333
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,815
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'm awfully sorry.

334
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:49,055
I can't understand it. These mechanical
things, you know they happen.

335
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,635
Hey, but better here than
up there, you know what I mean.

336
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,304
Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

337
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,714
I can't believe that there's
a convention; there's no room.

338
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:04,902
We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

339
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,942
- I'm sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.

340
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:10,282
Oh, no. No gambling.

341
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:15,912
And once he was back, he played small.

342
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:22,041
He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

343
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,081
...to the bank
with a natural lead over a five.

344
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:28,290
But I knew the trick
with whales like Ichikawa...

345
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,340
was that they can't bet small for long.

346
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,300
He didn't think of it as winning 10,000...

347
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,639
he thought of it as losing 90,000.

348
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:39,678
So, he upped his bets.

349
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:46,848
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash.

350
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:52,207
In the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

351
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:54,357
and keep them coming back.

352
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:56,776
The longer they play, the more they lose.

353
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:59,156
In the end, we get it all.

354
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:02,156
# Goddamn it Trying to make it real #

355
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,156
# Compared to what #

356
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:07,326
# Sock it to me #

357
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:12,336
In Vegas, everybody's
gotta watch everybody else.

358
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,624
Six. All right, who's gonna give me that?

359
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,694
Since the players are looking
to beat the casino...

360
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:19,294
Each and every roll, all right.

361
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,304
- The dealers are watching the players...
- Six.

362
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:26,133
- Fake a six.
- The boxmen are watching the dealers.

363
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:29,053
The floormen are watching the boxmen...

364
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,893
the pit bosses are watching the floormen...

365
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,852
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

366
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:37,811
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

367
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:40,021
I'm watching the casino manager...

368
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:43,321
and the eye in the sky is watching us all.

369
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,660
Plus, we had a dozen guys up there...

370
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,200
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house.

371
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,589
# Tryin' to make it real compared to what #

372
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,347
Yes!

373
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,187
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.

374
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:32,234
Lookin' good. Lookin' good.

375
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,234
Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come on.

376
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:36,244
Let me have a hundred on your hard ten.

377
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:38,284
Hundred on your hard ten. Thank you.

378
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,875
Here we go now. Yeeeow!

379
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:55,592
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice...

380
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:58,552
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

381
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:01,052
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You were great.

382
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:04,102
Thanks. Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

383
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:07,520
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

384
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,270
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

385
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,980
What do you mean? I made a lot
of money for you, I want my cut.

386
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,150
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.

387
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,149
What money? Look at the stack of chips.

388
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:21,449
- I want my half.
- I've been watching you all night.

389
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,989
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.

390
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,828
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- Get lost!

391
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,407
Get lost? Get lost? Yes! Yes!

392
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:33,208
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

393
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,548
# Slippin' and a-slidin' #
Changin' and a-hidin' #

394
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:40,008
# Been told a long time ago #

395
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:42,757
# I been told Baby, you've been born #

396
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:45,046
# I won't be your fool no more Oww #

397
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:58,525
# Baby, oh, baby #

398
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:02,484
# My sweet baby #

399
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,653
# You're the one #

400
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,882
What a move.

401
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,881
I fell in love right there.

402
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:30,011
But in Vegas, for a girl
like Ginger, love costs money.

403
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,931
# What's different about him #

404
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,681
# I don't really know #

405
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,810
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

406
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:43,849
# No matter how I try #

407
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:48,688
# I just can't make him cry #

408
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:52,698
- Ginger's mission in life was money.
- I'll be right back.

409
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:54,698
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

410
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:56,488
She was a queen around the casino.

411
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,277
She brought in high rollers...

412
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,446
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

413
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:02,616
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

414
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:05,116
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?

415
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:08,086
- And you do. Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.

416
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:10,747
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.

417
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:13,256
Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known...

418
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:16,546
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

419
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:23,014
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

420
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:25,264
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

421
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:27,434
to the little woman and his bank examiners.

422
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:30,224
# You only make me glad #

423
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:35,442
# Better listen, little girl #

424
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:39,192
# You're goin' walkin' down the street #

425
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,992
# I ain't got no love #

426
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:45,611
Any change?

427
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:50,581
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.

428
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:53,371
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

429
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,830
# This heart of stone #

430
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,419
- How you doin' tonight?
- Good.

431
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,500
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.

432
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,130
- Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.

433
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,260
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.

434
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,839
And that's what Vegas is all about.

435
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:11,774
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.

436
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,218
- It's kickback city.
- Have a good night.

437
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:16,138
Thank you. You too.

438
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:22,107
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.

439
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,277
Pit bosses, floor managers...

440
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,277
but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers...

441
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:30,817
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

442
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:32,615
Ginger took care of the parkers...

443
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,825
because they took care
of the security guards...

444
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:38,495
- who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.

445
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:41,875
- No problem.
- You are a doll.

446
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,875
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

447
00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:47,624
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

448
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:50,384
But one thing
I just could never understand...

449
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:52,884
was that she could have
everything under control...

450
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:56,053
except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

451
00:26:56,133 --> 00:27:00,183
Gin, you know I got other people
in this, they got partners.

452
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:02,373
I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you...

453
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:04,353
in this thing, okay?

454
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:07,732
You're gonna get yours back,
and you're gonna get back first, okay?

455
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:11,111
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?

456
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:13,521
Where are you? You're
in that place. Where are you?

457
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:15,531
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.

458
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:19,150
Where are you? Where are you?

459
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,910
I'm always here for you.

460
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,830
- You're my woman.
- I know.

461
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,868
The Ginger I knew wouldn't
even look at this creep.

462
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:31,038
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

463
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:33,038
He was a moocher, a card cheat...

464
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:35,798
a country club golf hustler, a scumbag.

465
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:38,469
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.

466
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:40,928
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

467
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,548
And somehow she could never turn him down.

468
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,478
The way Ginger saw it, I guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

469
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:48,637
Somebody had to take care of him.

470
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:52,766
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

471
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:55,686
If you find any cash in there,
we'll whack it up with you.

472
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,686
I mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

473
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,446
- That's why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.

474
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:03,545
- Back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.

475
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:06,484
- Look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.

476
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,494
# Volare #

477
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:10,554
Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

478
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:13,164
I mean, Frank Marino was there
to meet him, but so were the cops.

479
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:15,413
This time they wanted to pinch him...

480
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,683
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?

481
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:19,943
They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened.

482
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,123
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.

483
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:25,841
- Hold it, hold it. Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.

484
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:28,112
- And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.

485
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:31,762
Look at this. Beautiful!

486
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:36,221
I mean, that's what worried me. 'Cause it
turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

487
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:40,141
- All right, we're clear.
- There's more.

488
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:42,350
There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.

489
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,520
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.

490
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,149
Don't get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

491
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:51,359
What's that? Huh, what's that?

492
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:54,109
There's no more. Thanks, hon.

493
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,079
I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.

494
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,348
But the bosses didn't send me
out there to have a good time.

495
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:02,867
They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

496
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,877
And nobody interfered
with the fuckin' skim.

497
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,917
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?

498
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,916
Hey, Sammy.

499
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:15,176
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- Incredible.

500
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:17,547
Welcome to Vegas.

501
00:29:17,637 --> 00:29:19,676
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?

502
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:21,845
Ginger.

503
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:29,435
Holy shit. What've you been doing out here?

504
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:32,275
Honey, come here.

505
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:35,354
This is Jennifer and Nick,
they're dear friends of mine.

506
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:38,903
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

507
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,943
Okay, Sammy.

508
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:43,903
After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...

509
00:29:43,993 --> 00:29:46,162
and we took a ride to talk.

510
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,202
And then, he hit me with it.

511
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:51,002
What do you think about me moving out here?

512
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,542
What's the matter?
You got a problem with that?

513
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:58,710
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?

514
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,590
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you...

515
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,590
it's no joke out here, it's no joke.

516
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,720
You gotta keep a low profile.

517
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,660
It's not like back home. Right off
the bat, they don't like guys like us.

518
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,100
And this sheriff's a real cowboy.

519
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,100
Even the coppers aren't afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

520
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,729
I don't care. I wanna get away
from back home for a while.

521
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,768
I'm tired of that shit back there.

522
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,768
Look at this place. It's made of money.

523
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:24,278
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

524
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:27,198
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

525
00:30:27,238 --> 00:30:29,468
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.

526
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:31,407
I really gotta be careful.

527
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:33,657
I'm running a licensed place,
everything's legit.

528
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:36,456
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.

529
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:39,626
I'm especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

530
00:30:41,745 --> 00:30:44,415
Ace saw Vegas one way...

531
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:47,675
- You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
- Of course.

532
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:50,505
But I saw it another.

533
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,964
I saw it as untouched.

534
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:54,973
I mean, they had bookies, pimps...

535
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,094
and drug dealers I could shake down.

536
00:30:57,184 --> 00:30:59,094
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?

537
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:01,064
So I started gettin' everybody in line.

538
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:03,813
Best of all,
for the first time in my life...

539
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,353
I figured out a way not to lose.

540
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:08,693
Yeah, he had a foolproof scheme, all right.

541
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,773
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.

542
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:12,782
When he won, he collected;

543
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:15,491
when he lost, he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves.

544
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:18,951
What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?

545
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:21,531
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin'?

546
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:23,791
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

547
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:25,961
Oh, Nicky. I thought you was layin'.

548
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,830
No, no, I'm takin'. I was takin'.

549
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,879
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

550
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,919
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?

551
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,469
Maybe if I stick your fuckin'
face through this window...

552
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:39,508
you'll get unconfused.

553
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:41,548
- Gimme the fuckin' money.
- I'm sorry, Nick.

554
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,508
I didn't mean anything by it.

555
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:46,179
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?

556
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:49,897
- My fuckin' head.
- Smarten up.

557
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:52,977
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president.

558
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:59,657
George Washington was born...

559
00:31:59,737 --> 00:32:02,576
But still,
it was nice and quiet for a while.

560
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:05,156
Ginger and I presented
Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

561
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:08,575
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

562
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:10,575
Beautiful, you got a beautiful swing.

563
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:13,244
Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

564
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,044
Turned out to be one
of the other coaches...

565
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:18,254
was a fuckin' metro intelligence cop.

566
00:32:18,294 --> 00:32:21,384
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.

567
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:22,774
He's gotta realize that everything
can't be a home run that he does.

568
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:25,843
That's exactly what I keep tellin' him...

569
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,422
but that's the kind of kid he is.

570
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:31,592
And Nicky being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

571
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:35,141
Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work...

572
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,562
people got the message.

573
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:39,562
Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.

574
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:42,212
They wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint.

575
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:44,822
Like these two fuckin'
balloon heads over here.

576
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:47,650
They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin' grand...

577
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,650
- yeah, right, I'm sure.
- Hey! How are you?

578
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,660
How are you? What are you doing here?

579
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,780
I'm over here now.

580
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,290
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.

581
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:01,709
We're waiting on Carmine.

582
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:03,709
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.

583
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:07,378
He was here before. He had
a suitcase and then he left.

584
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:11,717
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?

585
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:13,717
He's gone?

586
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:15,717
He's not here?

587
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:20,266
Carmine's out?

588
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:22,515
I think maybe he went across the street...

589
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,805
or somewhere else or somethin'.

590
00:33:27,316 --> 00:33:30,566
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.

591
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:32,655
- Ah, thanks, Eddie.
- Yeah, lots of luck.

592
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:35,865
- Yeah, good luck to you too.
- Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.

593
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:39,365
Yeah, they don't need those anymore.

594
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:42,864
Guys from other crews
got away with a warning.

595
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,663
Everybody else, watch out.

596
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,123
Like these yokels here...

597
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:50,668
who never heard of Nicky
or the bosses back home.

598
00:33:50,703 --> 00:33:52,693
'Cause they're the morons
who give you the most trouble.

599
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,692
Even after we'd catch them,
they'd try sneaking back...

600
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:57,632
with beards and wigs and fake noses.

601
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,471
You can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet.

602
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:05,681
Like this guy,
he's bettin' lavender chips...

603
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:07,680
at 500 each with only one little problem...

604
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,220
he's always guessed right.

605
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,731
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy,
he'd have been tougher to spot.

606
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:18,070
But in the end, they're all greedy.

607
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:26,659
# I got a feelin' about the future #

608
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,028
# And it ain't too good I know that #

609
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:38,747
I saw that the dealer was weak,
but he wasn't in on it.

610
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:41,206
He just wasn't protecting his hand.

611
00:34:41,256 --> 00:34:43,416
He was lifting his hole card way too high.

612
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:59,854
Now, here's this guy reading
the dealer's hole card...

613
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:04,183
and signaling his buddy at this table.

614
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:12,994
And that's just what
these hustlers look for.

615
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:16,112
They cruise from casino to casino
looking for weak dealers...

616
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:19,162
the way lions look for weak antelope.

617
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,042
Operator, this is Mr. R.

618
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,831
Get me Armstrong and Friday
over at pit two right away.

619
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,228
BJ 19, second base, the beard.

620
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:51,648
Operator, I need Mr. Happy. Loud.

621
00:35:53,437 --> 00:36:00,367
# Happy birthday to you #

622
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:04,997
# Happy birthday, dear Jeff #

623
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,957
# Happy birthday to you #

624
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:31,263
Man down!

625
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:34,602
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.

626
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:37,102
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.

627
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:43,272
They never know what hit them.

628
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:44,762
And if and when they do find out...

629
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:47,532
that they just got zapped
by a cattle prod...

630
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,701
they wish they really did
have a heart attack.

631
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:54,701
Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals...

632
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:57,660
they were knocking
this place dead for years.

633
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,250
- He's got a wire on him.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

634
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,590
There it is. That's it.

635
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,590
- Cheater's justice.
- Oh, God!

636
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,718
No, no, no!

637
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:11,138
I wanted everybody to know...

638
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:13,428
that things were changed around here.

639
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:15,508
We had to make an example
of these pricks...

640
00:37:15,558 --> 00:37:17,518
that the party was over.

641
00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:19,937
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks...

642
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:22,227
with your right hand.

643
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:24,267
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.

644
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:26,726
- You can't do it with both hands?
- No, sir.

645
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:29,026
Can you do it with your left hand?

646
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:31,485
Well, I never tried.

647
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:34,486
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.

648
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:44,584
Now you're gonna have to learn
with your left hand.

649
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,544
- It's 100, 110, I think.
- Yes, it is.

650
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,584
Okay.

651
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:56,923
Hiya. That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public.

652
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:59,723
Why don't I take him...

653
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:02,133
over to the office and verify it?

654
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:04,222
A little privacy. And by the way...

655
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:06,261
send over a nice bottle
of champagne on ice.

656
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,271
- Sure will.
- Real special.

657
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:11,061
- By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
- Hi.

658
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:13,151
- Having a good time?
- Yes.

659
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:15,691
You want to count the money in privacy.

660
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,780
I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.
Can I get my winnings?

661
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,490
Look what they did to my hand, man.

662
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,619
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice:

663
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:32,499
You can either have the money and
the hammer or you can walk out of here.

664
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,749
- What do you want?
- I just wanna get out of here.

665
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:38,049
And don't forget to tell your friends
what happens if they fuck around here.

666
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:41,717
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake.

667
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:44,067
'Cause if you come back here,
and we catch either one of you...

668
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:45,867
we're gonna break your heads,
and you won't walk out of here.

669
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:50,306
You see that fuckin' saw?
We're gonna use it. You got it?

670
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:53,266
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.

671
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:56,146
Throw him in the alley and tell
the cops he got hit by a car.

672
00:38:56,606 --> 00:38:58,356
Within no time,
everything was set in place.

673
00:38:58,396 --> 00:39:00,355
We got rid of the freelance scamsters...

674
00:39:00,395 --> 00:39:03,814
the per was way up, the gods were happy.

675
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:06,984
And I decided to complicate my life.

676
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:09,234
For a guy who likes sure things...

677
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:11,864
I was about to bet the rest
of my life on a real long shot.

678
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:14,154
We're not gettin' any younger.

679
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:16,374
Don't you think it's time?

680
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:19,083
Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit?

681
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:21,253
What, are you trying to handicap me?

682
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:24,043
I'm gonna do you one better.

683
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,672
I'm tryin' to marry you.

684
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:28,842
You wanna marry me?

685
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:30,842
I'm serious.

686
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:36,550
I wanna settle down. I want a family.

687
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,560
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

688
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,770
I know I'd be a good father,
you'd be a good mother.

689
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,770
You don't know me.

690
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,850
You've known me two, three months.

691
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,399
I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

692
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:52,279
I know you well enough
to know that I really love you.

693
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,988
And I can't think
of anybody better to be with.

694
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:58,068
And I don't feel like waiting anymore.

695
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:01,947
You know a lot of happily
married people, Sam?

696
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:04,408
'Cause I don't.

697
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,748
Yeah, I know all that.

698
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:13,087
I care about you, okay.

699
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,876
But I just don't have those kind
of feelings for you.

700
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:23,095
I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

701
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:26,015
- All right, all right.
- Understand?

702
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,975
Sam, I'm sorry.

703
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:32,683
No, I... I...

704
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:36,733
I mean... I can grow.

705
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:40,983
As long as there's a mutual respect,
that kind of thing can grow.

706
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:43,613
I'm realistic. I can accept that.

707
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,992
What is love anyway?

708
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,702
It's a mutual respect. It's a devotion.

709
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:53,042
It's a caring from one person to another.

710
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:56,041
And if we could set up
some kind of foundation...

711
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,291
based on that mutual respect...

712
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:02,341
I feel eventually you
would care enough about me...

713
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,841
that I could live with that.

714
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,639
If it doesn't work out, doesn't play out...

715
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,559
then what happens to me?

716
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,619
You know I'm doing well now,
and I'm gonna do even better.

717
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,978
And so whatever happens...

718
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,978
if it doesn't work out between us...

719
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:22,518
I'm gonna make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

720
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,278
And if there are kids, especially...

721
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,528
I'll take care of you
better than you'd ever imagine.

722
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,986
What are you pitching me?

723
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:32,866
Just what I said, you'll be set up...

724
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:35,826
for the rest of your life,
that I can promise you.

725
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:41,665
Want to take a chance?

726
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,554
When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories.

727
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:57,214
But I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.

728
00:41:57,304 --> 00:42:00,134
I can change her.

729
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,054
It was typical Ace.

730
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:06,062
He invited the biggest people
in town, and he knew they'd show.

731
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:08,562
Because he knew they all wanted
somethin' from him.

732
00:42:08,602 --> 00:42:12,062
With Ace, nobody ever got
a free ride, even Ginger.

733
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:14,192
With her, he still covered his bets.

734
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,571
They had to have the baby
before they could get married.

735
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:18,731
He even made Jenny and me
watch Amy for a few days...

736
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,201
when they went on their honeymoon.

737
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:23,871
But I didn't mind, we loved the kid.

738
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,659
Can you feel my eyes on you?

739
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:34,000
Can you feel me look into your heart?

740
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,000
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?

741
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:42,219
Can you feel me in you?

742
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,508
In your heart?

743
00:42:47,388 --> 00:42:50,017
Don't make me come there.

744
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:51,887
Answer me.

745
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,897
I love you.

746
00:42:53,937 --> 00:42:56,727
But, baby, do you know that I love you too?

747
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:59,237
- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?

748
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:03,275
This is the best thing I can do
for my life right now.

749
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:05,775
That's right. So it's going to be okay.

750
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:08,445
Promise?

751
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,745
I wish you all the luck in the world.

752
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:12,289
You do?

753
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:15,954
Yeah, I do. It's the best thing
you can do right now.

754
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:18,494
I mean this.

755
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:21,083
You have real security.

756
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:24,463
Sweetheart, you're gonna be
situated just right, in Vegas.

757
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:27,003
Come on. This is great for us.

758
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:30,463
I'm always gonna be here for you.

759
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:32,633
I ain't going no place.

760
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:34,892
I'm lookin' at you right now.

761
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,722
I'm seein' you for the very first time,
right this minute.

762
00:43:37,812 --> 00:43:39,721
I can feel my heart click.

763
00:43:39,811 --> 00:43:42,981
I see you 14 years old.

764
00:43:43,061 --> 00:43:45,521
I see you the first second I ever saw you.

765
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:49,020
I see you, long-legged little colt...

766
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,400
stupid braces on your teeth.

767
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,780
- Okay, then.
- Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.

768
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,279
Talk to you later.

769
00:43:57,319 --> 00:43:59,238
Bye.

770
00:44:03,868 --> 00:44:05,828
You all right?

771
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:08,917
Yeah.

772
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:11,588
Why are you crying?

773
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:14,128
I'm not crying.

774
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,596
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

775
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:24,516
I'm okay, I just...

776
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:29,766
You just have to understand.

777
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:33,485
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.

778
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:37,984
I just wanted to say good-bye.

779
00:44:38,114 --> 00:44:41,944
I just... I don't...

780
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:44,283
I think I have a right to do that.

781
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,743
Okay?

782
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:51,413
It's all right.

783
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:54,501
That part of your life is over with.

784
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:57,251
- Right?
- Yeah.

785
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,131
You're with me now.

786
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,092
- Yeah.
- Right?

787
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,842
Uh-huh.

788
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:08,341
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

789
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,931
Yeah.

790
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,559
- Let's go. Let's go back in.
- Okay.

791
00:45:33,827 --> 00:45:35,747
Oh!

792
00:45:36,997 --> 00:45:40,956
Tsk. It's great.

793
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,546
It's great.

794
00:45:49,756 --> 00:45:52,845
It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

795
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:55,715
You brought all my stuff!

796
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:57,685
I can't...

797
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:01,605
Try it on. It's yours.

798
00:46:01,645 --> 00:46:04,434
You're kidding.

799
00:46:04,524 --> 00:46:07,734
Oh, my God. What is it?

800
00:46:07,814 --> 00:46:09,813
It's chinchilla.

801
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:12,653
Oh, it's so soft.

802
00:46:12,693 --> 00:46:16,282
Nice, isn't it?

803
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:22,412
No one's ever been so nice to me.

804
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,880
Oh!

805
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,170
Oh, my God!

806
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,719
So, do you think it's too much...

807
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:39,720
if I wear these all on the same day?

808
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,180
You do whatever you want.

809
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,720
Do I keep my promises or
do I keep my promises?

810
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,728
So wonderful. The jewelry's
not so bad either.

811
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:51,598
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.

812
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:54,608
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?

813
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:57,608
Pay attention to me.

814
00:46:57,688 --> 00:47:00,697
- What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
- Okay.

815
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:02,817
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

816
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:05,486
Money, this doesn't mean
anything without trust.

817
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:08,076
I have to be able
to trust you with my life.

818
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:21,005
With over a million in cash and jewels...

819
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:24,633
tucked in a bank in Vegas, only
for Ginger, she was secure and happy.

820
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:26,633
She loved that shit.

821
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:31,054
But a guy in my line of work has
to have a lot of payoff cash around.

822
00:47:31,094 --> 00:47:33,473
Crooked cops and kidnappers,
they don't take checks.

823
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:36,103
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?

824
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:38,683
So I put two million in cash
in a Los Angeles bank...

825
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:41,443
under the name of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.

826
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:44,402
This was strictly my shakedown
and kidnapping money.

827
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:51,701
And since I'd either be in jail
or locked in a closet...

828
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:54,161
when I needed the money the most...

829
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:59,370
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash
that could get me back alive.

830
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,119
- # I'll take you there #
- # I'm callin', callin' #

831
00:48:02,209 --> 00:48:04,419
# Callin' for mercy #

832
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:08,708
- # I'll take you there #
- # Mercy, mercy #

833
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:11,628
# I'll take you there #

834
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:14,178
This is a signature card.

835
00:48:14,218 --> 00:48:16,968
So once she signs those papers,
she'll be the only person...

836
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:20,637
to have total access to the box,
no one else, including myself?

837
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:23,687
That's right. That's the way you wanted it.

838
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:26,727
Sam, let me ask you a question.

839
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:29,017
You must really trust your wife.

840
00:48:31,856 --> 00:48:34,856
Yeah, sure I do. Why?

841
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:36,946
It's good. It's just unusual.

842
00:48:37,026 --> 00:48:39,195
Tell you the truth,
so many of my clients don't.

843
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:43,534
- # Let me take you there #
- # I'll take you there #

844
00:48:43,574 --> 00:48:47,834
- # Ain't no smilin' faces #
- # I'll take you there ##

845
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:55,463
# Never will I know happiness #

846
00:48:55,543 --> 00:48:59,382
With Ginger and the money
in place, I felt covered.

847
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:01,362
And to play it safe,
I switched job titles again...

848
00:49:01,382 --> 00:49:03,592
and made myself Food and Beverage Director.

849
00:49:03,722 --> 00:49:06,801
This way nobody would bother me
about a license.

850
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:09,762
I mean Vegas was like a dream for me.

851
00:49:09,852 --> 00:49:11,872
Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming
his own kind of Vegas.

852
00:49:11,892 --> 00:49:15,810
I put money out on the street
chargin' three points a week.

853
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,880
- Don't make us come lookin' for you.
- Juice to the fuckin' dealers.

854
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,860
You won't have to look for me.

855
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,860
I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

856
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,530
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.

857
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,409
In no time I had half the dealers
in the Tangiers in my pocket.

858
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:32,699
Then, I started bustin' out
high-stakes poker players.

859
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:34,998
It was so obvious.

860
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:39,747
All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics were
signal-happy. - I'm gonna open for 500.

861
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:42,587
Signaling back and forth.

862
00:49:42,627 --> 00:49:45,717
Why you cryin'
with two loaves of bread under your arm?

863
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:48,257
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.

864
00:49:48,297 --> 00:49:51,426
And I didn't want
any of those agents near my place.

865
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:55,095
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.

866
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:58,596
If I didn't have
bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.

867
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:02,315
I wished to God Nicky and
his whole crew would just get lost.

868
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:05,275
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?

869
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:08,065
Nicky's a made guy, and I'm not.
I can't do that.

870
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,155
Be careful. Gaming agents
are all over the place.

871
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:12,613
So I'm lucky. I'm not allowed
to get lucky in this place?

872
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:15,783
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.

873
00:50:15,823 --> 00:50:19,623
Ace was so fuckin' worried
about his casino...

874
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:23,123
he forgot what we were doin'
out here in the first place.

875
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:25,272
A million times I wanted to yell
in his fuckin' ear...

876
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,752
"This is Las Vegas.

877
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,632
We're supposed to be out here robbin'...

878
00:50:29,712 --> 00:50:32,251
you dumb fuckin' hebe."

879
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,300
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.

880
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,680
Tell him to take
his fuckin' feet off the table.

881
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,810
What's he think this is,
a goddamned sawdust joint?

882
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,020
Sir, would you mind
taking your feet off the table?

883
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,019
Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.

884
00:50:52,689 --> 00:50:54,649
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.

885
00:50:54,729 --> 00:50:56,649
Call security.

886
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:03,238
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

887
00:51:03,278 --> 00:51:06,948
Wanna do me a favor? Take your feet off
the table and put your shoes back on.

888
00:51:07,038 --> 00:51:08,907
Fuck you!

889
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,836
I want you to exit this guy
off the premises...

890
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:17,336
and use his head to open the fucking door.

891
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:21,255
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Wanna come with us outside?

892
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:24,175
Bullshit. I ain't goin' anywhere with you.

893
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:26,514
- Bullshit. You're outta here.
- Fuck you!

894
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:29,884
You know who you're fucking with? Do you?

895
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:32,933
You fucking faggot! Do you know
who you're fucking with?

896
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:35,473
Leave me alone!

897
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:38,104
- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!

898
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:40,484
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.

899
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:44,443
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

900
00:51:44,483 --> 00:51:46,652
No, I didn't know that.
But you know what he did?

901
00:51:46,692 --> 00:51:49,952
I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

902
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:52,822
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?

903
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:55,201
- I threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.

904
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:58,041
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?

905
00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:01,371
- Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?

906
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:05,210
Come here. Come here.

907
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,709
You go over there. You apologize.

908
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,919
You better hope he lets you back in.

909
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:13,049
If you get outta line again,
I'll smash your head so hard...

910
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:16,099
you won't be able
to get that cowboy hat on.

911
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:18,558
Fuckin' hick. Sammy, listen.

912
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,688
This guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to.

913
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:24,267
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.

914
00:52:24,397 --> 00:52:26,517
I mean, he's already very sorry.

915
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,397
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

916
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,777
I swear he'll never get out of line again.

917
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,197
If he does it again, he's out for good.

918
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:36,867
I don't care what it is,
I'll never let him in the place again.

919
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:38,947
I'm sorry about this, really.

920
00:52:39,077 --> 00:52:42,245
All right, Ace? Thanks, pal.

921
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:46,035
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?

922
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:49,915
You shit-kickin', stinky-horse-manure-smellin'
motherfucker, you!

923
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:52,754
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in the desert.

924
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:56,094
- Go over and apologize.
- Nicky, I'm sorry.

925
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:00,383
# You're dear to me Yes, sirree #

926
00:53:00,423 --> 00:53:03,012
You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy.

927
00:53:03,132 --> 00:53:05,302
Especially when he got bigger in town.

928
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:08,582
Like when he hired that Jonathan and David
and their tigers away from the Palace...

929
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,272
by building them a new stage
and giving them a Rolls-Royce.

930
00:53:12,312 --> 00:53:15,101
But I'll tell you, he knew
how to bring in the crowds.

931
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,272
He knew all the fuckin' angles.

932
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:20,281
He brought over the whole
"Femme Fatale" show from Paris...

933
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:23,361
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

934
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:27,780
He had to weigh 'em in once a week to make
sure they didn't blow up like balloons.

935
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,790
She's still eight pounds over.

936
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,950
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.

937
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,290
Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

938
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,458
I'm trying to use respect.

939
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,998
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

940
00:53:40,128 --> 00:53:43,798
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them...

941
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:46,968
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

942
00:53:47,008 --> 00:53:50,847
I guess she's frightened. If she doesn't
lose weight she may get fired.

943
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:54,017
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris...

944
00:53:54,057 --> 00:53:56,726
- It's been our policy...
- Just stop everything!

945
00:53:56,806 --> 00:53:59,046
- This woman's an institution.
- That's the problem. She's lazy.

946
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:01,355
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit.

947
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:03,735
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.

948
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:07,156
This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

949
00:54:07,236 --> 00:54:09,486
So why not take advantage, right?

950
00:54:09,526 --> 00:54:12,155
So, he took bookie joints off the street...

951
00:54:12,235 --> 00:54:14,954
and then opened them up inside the casino.

952
00:54:14,994 --> 00:54:17,204
Within a few years by doing all of this...

953
00:54:17,284 --> 00:54:19,954
he had every casino on the strip
trying to copy off of him.

954
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:22,204
Between my innovations...

955
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:24,373
# Look like they're taking
some cat to jail #

956
00:54:24,463 --> 00:54:27,833
and Nicky's dedication to his job...

957
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:30,383
# Steamboats are comin' and
they're splashing and goin' #

958
00:54:30,418 --> 00:54:32,513
I soon had the best operation on the strip.

959
00:54:32,593 --> 00:54:34,971
# Moon is shinin' on friends below #

960
00:54:35,051 --> 00:54:39,051
You gotta watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you already.

961
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:41,931
Why? Somebody's complainin'?

962
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:44,101
I'm hearing things from security.

963
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:46,560
The sheriff's lookin'
to put you in the Black Book.

964
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,980
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.

965
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,980
They got two names
from the whole country...

966
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,069
and one of 'em is still Al Capone.

967
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:56,530
If they put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

968
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,859
You will not be able to walk into a casino.

969
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:01,489
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.

970
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:04,369
I'm just tellin' you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

971
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:06,369
All right.

972
00:55:10,577 --> 00:55:13,917
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead. Very nice.

973
00:55:13,957 --> 00:55:16,217
Thank you.

974
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:21,221
For his hard work and dedication...

975
00:55:21,256 --> 00:55:24,466
and the new life blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas...

976
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:27,306
Sam has established himself
as an indispensable member...

977
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:29,895
of the gaming community.

978
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:32,224
As the head of the
Tangiers Gaming Corporation...

979
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:34,774
it's my pleasure
to welcome Sam Rothstein...

980
00:55:34,854 --> 00:55:37,024
to the Vegas Valley Country Club.

981
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:46,154
Back home, they would've put me
in jail for what I'm doing.

982
00:55:46,244 --> 00:55:49,493
But out here, they're giving me awards.

983
00:55:49,573 --> 00:55:53,952
It is with great pleasure that I accept
this certificate of appreciation...

984
00:55:53,992 --> 00:55:56,542
for charitable donations
to greater Las Vegas.

985
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:58,832
Congratulations, sweetheart.

986
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:02,292
Sam raised more than
we've ever raised before.

987
00:56:02,382 --> 00:56:06,840
But my greatest pleasure was watching
my wife, Ginger, work the room.

988
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,470
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?

989
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,140
She could be the most
charming woman you ever saw.

990
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,180
People loved to be around her.

991
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:18,179
You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.

992
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:20,899
We'd love to have you there.

993
00:56:20,979 --> 00:56:22,939
- Yes, okay.
- Great.

994
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:25,478
She made everybody feel good.

995
00:56:25,568 --> 00:56:29,897
# That's Stella by starlight #

996
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:32,107
Congratulations, Sam.

997
00:56:32,197 --> 00:56:34,157
Oh, thanks.

998
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:36,488
- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?
- Hi.

999
00:56:38,908 --> 00:56:41,747
You're one of the most
gorgeous women I've ever seen.

1000
00:56:41,827 --> 00:56:44,496
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.

1001
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:48,836
Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.

1002
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:51,255
He was a young kid from the casino.

1003
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:53,545
Nice kid. Bright boy.

1004
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:56,925
What balls on this fuckin' kid!
The next day I fired him.

1005
00:56:57,005 --> 00:57:01,884
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.

1006
00:57:02,014 --> 00:57:05,603
Do you wanna see this one? Ahhhh!

1007
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:09,893
Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

1008
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:12,733
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!

1009
00:57:12,813 --> 00:57:15,232
They didn't know what really moved her.

1010
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:19,192
Look at this. Look at this.
Daddy gave me this...

1011
00:57:19,242 --> 00:57:23,781
And with Ginger happy, I was able
to concentrate on what I knew best.

1012
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:26,331
Loose machines are right back over there.

1013
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:29,451
What are they doin' back there?
You can't even see 'em there.

1014
00:57:29,581 --> 00:57:33,081
- Okay, I'll...
- What about the progressives with the high jackpots?

1015
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:36,710
- Well...
- These are our best machines. They bring all the action.

1016
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,920
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.

1017
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,919
- The action is in the front. Bring 'em up front.
- All right, I will.

1018
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:45,029
Listen to me very carefully. There are
three ways of doing things around here:

1019
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:47,808
The right way, the wrong way
and the way that I do it.

1020
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:51,678
- You understand?
- I do understand that. I'll get right on it.

1021
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,268
- And thank you.
- Don't thank me. Just do it.

1022
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:58,517
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

1023
00:57:58,606 --> 00:58:01,856
Dang, you are right,
Mr. Rothstein. I am so sorry.

1024
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:05,526
So I ended up working...
what, 18-hour days.

1025
00:58:05,606 --> 00:58:08,866
Ginger was the one who wound up
enjoying the best of Vegas.

1026
00:58:08,946 --> 00:58:12,115
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.

1027
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:14,866
What did you say to that
fucking jerk, anyway?

1028
00:58:14,956 --> 00:58:17,455
I told him I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

1029
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:20,835
Well, you might
as well get something out of it.

1030
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:25,254
Well, it wasn't long...

1031
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:27,884
before what I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

1032
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:31,884
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas.

1033
00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:35,892
And from then on, I couldn't be seen
talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.

1034
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:38,932
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1035
00:58:38,972 --> 00:58:42,892
"He will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

1036
00:58:42,982 --> 00:58:47,151
And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

1037
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,656
every time he shows up."

1038
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:52,991
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

1039
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,529
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation..."

1040
00:58:56,609 --> 00:58:59,279
Motherfucker!

1041
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:01,989
Is there any way around this?

1042
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,830
No, there's no way.

1043
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:07,999
Let's say, for instance...

1044
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,589
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

1045
00:59:11,669 --> 00:59:13,588
to get one of those sandwiches I like?

1046
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:17,338
Forget it. You can't even
set foot in the parking lot.

1047
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,847
That's how serious it is.

1048
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:23,217
In other words, I'm fucked?

1049
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:25,687
In so many words, yes.

1050
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:29,896
It just didn't sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

1051
00:59:29,976 --> 00:59:32,895
Not being able to go
into a casino is one thing...

1052
00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:37,565
but being in this book etched your name
into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.

1053
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:41,364
I mean, you're listed in there
with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.

1054
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:45,034
I gotta do something.
They ain't gettin' rid of me.

1055
00:59:45,074 --> 00:59:47,824
They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.

1056
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:50,324
Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.

1057
00:59:54,543 --> 00:59:57,163
So, once they pulled that shit...

1058
00:59:57,213 --> 01:00:00,383
I started doin' my own things
nobody ever thought of doin'.

1059
01:00:00,423 --> 01:00:05,382
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my
kid brother, Dominick, and some desperados...

1060
01:00:05,422 --> 01:00:08,382
and started knockin' over
high-rollers, casino bosses...

1061
01:00:08,432 --> 01:00:11,221
bookmakers... anybody right here in town.

1062
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:13,931
I had a good fuckin' crew goin'
for me, I'll tell you that.

1063
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:17,695
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.

1064
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:22,690
Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

1065
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:27,529
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

1066
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:30,238
It was like old times.

1067
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:34,868
And I opened up my own jewelry
store too, the "Gold Rush."

1068
01:00:34,948 --> 01:00:38,367
Sometimes I used to go along
on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1069
01:00:38,457 --> 01:00:41,377
But I didn't like the people
I was rippin' off looking at me...

1070
01:00:41,457 --> 01:00:44,208
so I used to turn
their fuckin' pictures around.

1071
01:00:44,298 --> 01:00:47,207
- What's takin' so long?
- This is a motherfucker!

1072
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:51,506
- It's working.
- Learn how to open these things so you don't have to take 'em.

1073
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:54,426
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1074
01:00:54,466 --> 01:00:57,976
Tell Pepe if he's switching stones on us,
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1075
01:00:58,056 --> 01:01:00,346
Yeah?

1076
01:01:00,436 --> 01:01:02,685
- They're in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

1077
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:04,815
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

1078
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:07,814
- Yes. Don't worry.
- All right. Thanks.

1079
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:10,604
He had tipsters all over town. Bellmen.

1080
01:01:10,644 --> 01:01:13,363
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

1081
01:01:13,443 --> 01:01:15,523
- Valet parkers.
- They're just checking in now.

1082
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:17,533
Okay, I'll tell him.

1083
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:19,533
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1084
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:21,533
- 1230. Right.
- Secretaries.

1085
01:01:21,613 --> 01:01:24,831
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

1086
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:26,271
And they all got a piece of the score.

1087
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:29,161
Car's coming.

1088
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,462
They were very careful.

1089
01:01:34,502 --> 01:01:37,091
They always bypassed the alarms, or else...

1090
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:41,631
if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1091
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,970
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.

1092
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,769
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1093
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:52,899
For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the fucking wild west.

1094
01:01:52,979 --> 01:01:55,439
I just got a shipment
of diamonds from Israel.

1095
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:59,398
What the fuck they expect
from me? I had to earn, didn't I?

1096
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:01,817
You know, this diamond has flaws in it.

1097
01:02:01,857 --> 01:02:05,367
- There's no flaws.
- I'm doing this for 25 years.

1098
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:08,737
You better clean your loupe,
because there's no flaws.

1099
01:02:08,866 --> 01:02:11,326
Whenever we got local merch...

1100
01:02:11,366 --> 01:02:14,496
we'd usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

1101
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:17,166
I had a couple of sand niggers
out there. You know, Arabs.

1102
01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:19,796
What, are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1103
01:02:19,876 --> 01:02:22,004
I know his language.

1104
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:24,045
Forty thousand dollars. The whole package.

1105
01:02:24,135 --> 01:02:26,885
Twenty thousand. That's my final offer.

1106
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:30,555
He suddenly talks English. Let's talk
Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.

1107
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:33,554
I actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vault...

1108
01:02:33,594 --> 01:02:36,104
where I kept the choice stuff.

1109
01:02:36,224 --> 01:02:39,603
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush...

1110
01:02:39,683 --> 01:02:41,893
in case we got raided by the cops...

1111
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:43,892
or if my crew got cute.

1112
01:02:43,942 --> 01:02:46,942
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1113
01:02:46,982 --> 01:02:49,942
She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching TV.

1114
01:02:49,982 --> 01:02:53,612
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

1115
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:56,951
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't
even supposed to be doin' it.

1116
01:02:56,991 --> 01:02:59,950
The bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos...

1117
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:03,250
that they didn't want anybody
makin' any waves for them.

1118
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,959
You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

1119
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:07,959
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?

1120
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:12,469
That's why there was no real organized
street stuff in Vegas before I came here.

1121
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:15,470
But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

1122
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,928
You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do...

1123
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:20,138
that in a venture of this kind...

1124
01:03:20,178 --> 01:03:22,603
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1125
01:03:22,638 --> 01:03:26,768
So I put some of the money into legitimate
deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

1126
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:30,567
You will try to push it through,
won't you, Mr. Clark?

1127
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:33,317
- Yes.
- I'm giving you 50,000 cash.

1128
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:36,816
Then I put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1129
01:03:36,906 --> 01:03:38,816
- Is that the last one?
- Yeah.

1130
01:03:38,906 --> 01:03:42,285
I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

1131
01:03:42,325 --> 01:03:44,285
Fuckers.

1132
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:50,125
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.

1133
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,584
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

1134
01:03:52,664 --> 01:03:54,663
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1135
01:03:54,713 --> 01:03:56,753
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin'?

1136
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,423
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1137
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,423
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1138
01:04:03,513 --> 01:04:06,843
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1139
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:11,103
He had politicians, showgirls and movie
stars hanging out all over the place.

1140
01:04:11,183 --> 01:04:13,522
That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

1141
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:17,021
By the way, Sammy said, whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1142
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:20,191
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.

1143
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:23,111
- He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.

1144
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:26,820
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls, naturally.

1145
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:29,620
I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star.

1146
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,989
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.

1147
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:33,999
- Hey, Shelly. How are you?
- Hi.

1148
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:36,159
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.

1149
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,788
- This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.

1150
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:42,378
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1151
01:04:42,498 --> 01:04:45,338
Come on. I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1152
01:04:45,418 --> 01:04:48,337
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1153
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:52,557
And you can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1154
01:04:52,677 --> 01:04:55,637
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1155
01:04:55,727 --> 01:04:59,227
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1156
01:04:59,307 --> 01:05:03,066
Now, pink veal, you can pound
that shit for two days.

1157
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:06,646
It'll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1158
01:05:06,776 --> 01:05:09,775
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1159
01:05:09,855 --> 01:05:12,944
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1160
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:15,074
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?

1161
01:05:15,194 --> 01:05:17,404
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?

1162
01:05:17,534 --> 01:05:22,243
You know you're a lyin' lowlife,
motherfuckin' gamblin' degenerate prick?

1163
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:24,663
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1164
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:26,912
I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent...

1165
01:05:27,002 --> 01:05:29,252
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

1166
01:05:29,372 --> 01:05:32,672
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin' heat's off.

1167
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:34,961
And you didn't gamble that fuckin' money?

1168
01:05:35,001 --> 01:05:36,961
- No? You didn't?
- I didn't...

1169
01:05:37,051 --> 01:05:40,301
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck outta me.

1170
01:05:40,381 --> 01:05:43,892
You wanna embarrass me and make
a fool outta me? You didn't gamble?

1171
01:05:43,972 --> 01:05:46,270
Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money...

1172
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:49,190
I'll give you the fuckin' money
to put the fuckin' heat on!

1173
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,600
Did you gamble? Huh?

1174
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:57,029
Fuckin' degenerate.

1175
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:59,899
Fuckin' kids at home.

1176
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:05,408
Here. Get the fuck outta here.

1177
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:07,498
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1178
01:06:07,577 --> 01:06:10,327
Let me find out you fucked up.
I'll leave you where I find you.

1179
01:06:10,707 --> 01:06:12,627
How many of these you gonna eat?

1180
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:14,627
- Two.
- Two?

1181
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:17,627
But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day...

1182
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:20,126
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1183
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:23,255
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1184
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:26,175
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?

1185
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,975
- Not a lot. You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1186
01:06:29,015 --> 01:06:31,975
- Why?
- 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1187
01:06:32,015 --> 01:06:36,185
What a smart kid you are. Okay, eat.

1188
01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:39,025
Every couple of weeks,
I used to send Marino...

1189
01:06:39,105 --> 01:06:41,853
back to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

1190
01:06:41,893 --> 01:06:44,233
Not a bit piece, but what did they know?

1191
01:06:44,313 --> 01:06:47,533
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

1192
01:06:47,573 --> 01:06:49,653
Their drop was a truck stop garage...

1193
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:52,703
where Remo and the guys used
to hang out and count their millions.

1194
01:06:52,743 --> 01:06:54,702
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.

1195
01:06:54,742 --> 01:06:57,412
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.

1196
01:06:57,492 --> 01:06:59,582
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

1197
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:01,251
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.

1198
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:04,580
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do...

1199
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:08,000
I would carry things out to a "T."

1200
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:12,260
Like the time Tony Dogs, who's supposed
to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

1201
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,760
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1202
01:07:19,018 --> 01:07:22,229
Here's a fuckin' guy
kills two of Remo's guys...

1203
01:07:22,349 --> 01:07:26,729
and a poor fuckin' waitress who was just
workin' on her night off, of all things.

1204
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:32,238
I mean, this guy's just beggin'
to be made an example of.

1205
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:36,028
Frankie, I want the names
of all the other people he had with him.

1206
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:39,486
And I don't care what you have
to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?

1207
01:07:39,576 --> 01:07:41,656
- I'll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow 'em down.

1208
01:07:41,746 --> 01:07:44,996
To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this guy.

1209
01:07:45,076 --> 01:07:47,916
He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

1210
01:07:47,956 --> 01:07:50,455
This son of a bitch was tough.

1211
01:07:50,545 --> 01:07:54,005
For two days and two fuckin' nights
we beat the shit outta this guy.

1212
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:56,424
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.

1213
01:07:56,464 --> 01:08:00,254
- Better give me a name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.

1214
01:08:00,304 --> 01:08:03,473
- But he never talked.
- I know you would've ratted by now.

1215
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:06,143
In the end, I had to put
his fuckin' head in a vise.

1216
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:08,973
Dogs, Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?

1217
01:08:09,063 --> 01:08:11,974
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.

1218
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:16,192
I'll squash your fuckin' head like a
grapefruit if you don't give me a name.

1219
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:18,562
Don't make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

1220
01:08:18,612 --> 01:08:21,732
Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.

1221
01:08:21,782 --> 01:08:24,281
Fuck you!

1222
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:27,531
This motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fuckin' days and nights.

1223
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:30,161
Fuck me? Fuck me? You motherfucker!

1224
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:33,081
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're tellin' me?

1225
01:08:33,121 --> 01:08:36,039
You motherfucker, you! Huh?

1226
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,499
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin' name!

1227
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:41,499
Charlie M.

1228
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:43,509
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.

1229
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:46,509
You make me pop your
fuckin' eye outta your head...

1230
01:08:46,549 --> 01:08:49,468
to protect that piece of shit, Charlie M.?

1231
01:08:49,548 --> 01:08:51,508
You dumb motherfucker!

1232
01:08:51,638 --> 01:08:53,717
Kill me, you fuck! Kill me!

1233
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:56,187
You motherfucker, you!

1234
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:58,556
Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.

1235
01:08:58,686 --> 01:09:01,147
The word got around that finally...

1236
01:09:01,187 --> 01:09:04,147
there was a real gangster in town.

1237
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:06,277
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

1238
01:09:06,357 --> 01:09:08,317
Charlie M.

1239
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:15,745
Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots.

1240
01:09:15,825 --> 01:09:18,165
Do you have any idea what the odds are?

1241
01:09:18,285 --> 01:09:20,705
It's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.

1242
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:24,044
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn't you call me?

1243
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:27,674
It happened so quick. Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.

1244
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:31,503
- You didn't see the scam?
- There's no way to determine that.

1245
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:33,752
Yes, there is. They won!

1246
01:09:33,842 --> 01:09:36,922
It's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

1247
01:09:37,012 --> 01:09:40,432
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.

1248
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:44,931
You know goddamn well somebody had to get into
those machines and set those fuckin' reels.

1249
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:47,941
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1250
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:50,521
On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions.

1251
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:52,771
What's the matter with you?

1252
01:09:52,861 --> 01:09:57,740
Didn't you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1253
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,070
I think you're overreacting.

1254
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:03,410
Listen, you fuckin' yokel. I've been
carrying your ass ever since I got here.

1255
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:06,909
- Get your ass outta here.
- You're firing me?

1256
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:09,498
I'm firing you. No, I'm not firing...

1257
01:10:09,578 --> 01:10:12,878
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.

1258
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:15,338
This is not the way to treat people.

1259
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:17,468
If you didn't know,
you're too fuckin' dumb.

1260
01:10:17,508 --> 01:10:18,897
If you did know, you were in on it.

1261
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:22,387
Either way, you're out.
Get out. Come on. Let's go.

1262
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:25,467
The guy's history as far as I'm concerned.

1263
01:10:25,557 --> 01:10:29,096
But you can't fire him. His
brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1264
01:10:29,135 --> 01:10:34,315
Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county
commissioner or related to a commissioner.

1265
01:10:34,395 --> 01:10:36,685
This is his state. His uncle's chief judge.

1266
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:39,145
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

1267
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,155
You're in the finances, you're upstairs.

1268
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:45,074
But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.

1269
01:10:45,114 --> 01:10:47,994
I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.

1270
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:50,749
They're all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1271
01:10:50,784 --> 01:10:54,453
I have to let them know I'm watching
all the details all the time.

1272
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:58,163
There is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1273
01:10:58,253 --> 01:11:01,083
- Look at yours. Look at that.
- Huh?

1274
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,831
Look at this. There's nothing.

1275
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:06,381
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.

1276
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:08,881
What are you talking about?

1277
01:11:08,971 --> 01:11:11,341
If you don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1278
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:15,010
- Where are you going?
- # How long can this go on #

1279
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:19,230
From now on, I want you to put an equal
amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1280
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:22,139
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

1281
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:24,899
Do you know how long that's going to take?

1282
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:28,818
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1283
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:36,619
Just a little. That a girl.

1284
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:39,078
Oh, boy, look. You wanna go to Mommy?

1285
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:42,157
Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.

1286
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:46,167
I need to talk to you. I need some money.

1287
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:49,626
- What do you need?
- Got her?

1288
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:53,506
Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.

1289
01:11:53,546 --> 01:11:55,886
Why don't you take it out of your account?

1290
01:11:55,966 --> 01:11:59,176
I would, you know, Sam, it's just that...

1291
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:02,174
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.

1292
01:12:02,224 --> 01:12:06,394
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?

1293
01:12:06,514 --> 01:12:09,684
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?

1294
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:12,693
What's the difference? I just need it.

1295
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:14,773
Well, I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.

1296
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:16,903
You're not asking for a box of popcorn.

1297
01:12:16,943 --> 01:12:19,533
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.

1298
01:12:19,573 --> 01:12:22,283
Okay? We don't have to have a fight.

1299
01:12:22,363 --> 01:12:25,112
It's important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.

1300
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:29,202
Who's fighting?
I mean, tell me what it's for.

1301
01:12:32,002 --> 01:12:36,171
Why can't you tell me what it's for? Huh?

1302
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,050
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

1303
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,760
My wife comes to me and asks me
for 25,000. What do you want, a coat?

1304
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,389
- No.
- If you want a coat, you got it.

1305
01:12:47,509 --> 01:12:51,849
It's not the money. It's just, why do you
want it? Am I not entitled to ask that?

1306
01:12:51,929 --> 01:12:56,058
Sam, I've been independent my whole life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.

1307
01:12:56,148 --> 01:12:59,227
- Now you're making me beg.
- What are you talking about?

1308
01:12:59,267 --> 01:13:02,817
And you're embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

1309
01:13:02,897 --> 01:13:05,907
You're asking me for 25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.

1310
01:13:06,027 --> 01:13:08,067
I want to just be able to trust you.

1311
01:13:08,157 --> 01:13:10,077
You know, it's about trust.

1312
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:13,077
I have to be able
to trust you with my life.

1313
01:13:13,157 --> 01:13:16,246
Do you understand?

1314
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:18,576
Can I trust you?

1315
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:23,965
Can I trust you?

1316
01:13:25,215 --> 01:13:29,095
Can I trust you?
Answer me. Can I trust you?

1317
01:13:29,175 --> 01:13:31,134
You can trust me.

1318
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:34,593
Good. So then you could tell me
what the money is for.

1319
01:13:38,393 --> 01:13:42,223
# You've got to #

1320
01:13:42,353 --> 01:13:45,182
# Give a little #

1321
01:13:45,232 --> 01:13:48,732
# Take a little #

1322
01:13:48,812 --> 01:13:53,281
# And let your poor heart #

1323
01:13:53,361 --> 01:13:56,110
# Break a little #

1324
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,861
Yeah, she's leaving the bank now.

1325
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:01,331
All right, I'm gonna follow her.

1326
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:03,506
What is that?

1327
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,370
I know that look. What does that look mean?

1328
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:08,620
It means I got the money.

1329
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,959
# You've got to #

1330
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:15,919
- # Give a little #
- Yes, you're way up on top now.

1331
01:14:16,009 --> 01:14:18,178
# Take a little ##

1332
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:29,936
How are you doin', Les? It's Lester, right?

1333
01:14:30,016 --> 01:14:31,896
Sam.

1334
01:14:36,026 --> 01:14:39,695
From my recollection,
aren't you the card shark...

1335
01:14:39,735 --> 01:14:43,615
the golf hustler,
the pimp from Beverly Hills?

1336
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,865
If I'm wrong, please correct me.

1337
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:50,575
'Cause I never knew you to be a heist man.

1338
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,994
But if you are, you know what?

1339
01:14:53,084 --> 01:14:55,414
Here, take mine too.

1340
01:14:55,494 --> 01:14:58,794
Go ahead. Take it.
'Cause you already have hers.

1341
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:02,253
She's my wife. Look at me.

1342
01:15:02,343 --> 01:15:06,592
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew that she's my wife?

1343
01:15:06,672 --> 01:15:09,592
- Hey, look at me.
- Yeah, I know that.

1344
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:12,092
You know, yeah?

1345
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:16,971
But if you ever come back again, ever...

1346
01:15:17,061 --> 01:15:19,891
to take her money,
next time bring a pistol.

1347
01:15:19,941 --> 01:15:22,021
That way you got a chance.

1348
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,899
Be a man. Don't be a fucking pimp.

1349
01:15:24,939 --> 01:15:28,399
Now, you wanna do me a favor?
Get outta here.

1350
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:32,109
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get up and get outta here.

1351
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:34,279
- And you want to be free.
- # Take a little #

1352
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,488
Why, you feel that you are too good...

1353
01:15:36,538 --> 01:15:39,459
much too good for a nobody like me.

1354
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:43,249
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- That's fuckin' bullshit.

1355
01:15:43,329 --> 01:15:46,958
- # That's the story #
- Well, darling, I guess it's best...

1356
01:15:46,998 --> 01:15:51,627
- # That's the glory of love #
- that we should part.

1357
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:54,467
Remember when you called him
that night and said good-bye?

1358
01:15:54,507 --> 01:15:57,517
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down."

1359
01:15:57,597 --> 01:16:00,426
- He didn't say that to you, did he?
- No, he didn't.

1360
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:03,515
No. Instead, what did he say?

1361
01:16:05,015 --> 01:16:08,105
"Fuck him. Take him
for everything he's got."

1362
01:16:08,145 --> 01:16:11,734
Come here. I want to show you something.

1363
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:17,484
# That's the story # - The second letter
came right after I gave you your start.

1364
01:16:17,534 --> 01:16:21,613
No! No! No!

1365
01:16:21,652 --> 01:16:26,162
No! Make 'em stop it!

1366
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:31,413
No! No!

1367
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:34,832
It's not his fault! It's my fault!

1368
01:16:42,221 --> 01:16:45,340
No!

1369
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:50,350
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Piece of shit.

1370
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:02,698
Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!

1371
01:17:02,778 --> 01:17:04,778
He's such a prick!

1372
01:17:04,858 --> 01:17:07,867
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.

1373
01:17:07,907 --> 01:17:10,372
He didn't want to do it himself.

1374
01:17:10,407 --> 01:17:13,497
Oh, no, he didn't want
to get his own hands dirty.

1375
01:17:13,537 --> 01:17:17,247
So why did he have to do that, huh?

1376
01:17:17,337 --> 01:17:19,206
Tell me.

1377
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:22,126
- I know it wasn't a nice thing to do...
- No shit.

1378
01:17:22,216 --> 01:17:26,586
You gotta understand it. He doesn't know
if this guy is shaking you down...

1379
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:31,055
No. No. I told him all about this guy
before we ever got married.

1380
01:17:31,095 --> 01:17:35,225
- This is no fucking surprise.
- Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

1381
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:39,064
He's just a friend of mine
I was trying to help. So what?

1382
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:42,983
You know, the first time
I ever saw you guys together...

1383
01:17:43,103 --> 01:17:45,393
I never saw him so happy.

1384
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:48,943
I mean, I know he's
a crazy Jew fuck and everything...

1385
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:52,942
but I never seen him act
like that with anybody else.

1386
01:17:53,072 --> 01:17:56,911
I think he's crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.

1387
01:17:56,991 --> 01:18:00,741
Come on. I went into this
with my eyes open, you know.

1388
01:18:00,831 --> 01:18:03,291
I knew the bottom
could drop out at any time.

1389
01:18:03,371 --> 01:18:06,291
You don't think I'm gonna
go into a situation like this...

1390
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:09,131
if I don't think I'm gonna
get covered on the back end.

1391
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:11,421
- Sure, I can see that.
- Right?

1392
01:18:11,551 --> 01:18:15,679
So I put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.

1393
01:18:15,759 --> 01:18:18,759
You mean like a lot
of expensive jewelry? About how much?

1394
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:21,469
You want to steal it?

1395
01:18:21,509 --> 01:18:24,479
No. I'm just curious. I was wondering...

1396
01:18:24,519 --> 01:18:27,478
how much he would put
into a thing like that.

1397
01:18:27,518 --> 01:18:30,688
I'm told it's worth
about a million dollars, maybe more.

1398
01:18:30,768 --> 01:18:33,647
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?

1399
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,697
A million dollars in jewelry.

1400
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,027
Does that tell you
the guy is crazy about you?

1401
01:18:38,156 --> 01:18:42,116
I should've never married him.
He's a Gemini.

1402
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:44,906
Triple Gemini. Duality.

1403
01:18:44,996 --> 01:18:48,496
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.

1404
01:18:48,536 --> 01:18:51,169
I mean it.

1405
01:18:51,204 --> 01:18:55,044
I know what you mean. Listen, Ginger.

1406
01:18:55,084 --> 01:18:58,965
You know, this is probably not...
I don't have the answers anyway.

1407
01:18:59,005 --> 01:19:01,844
- This is probably not what you want to hear...
- I do.

1408
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:05,054
'Cause you're a little upset,
and I understand that.

1409
01:19:05,134 --> 01:19:09,513
But I think you should try to make the
best of it now. Go slow. See what happens.

1410
01:19:09,553 --> 01:19:13,852
He could've killed him! Okay? He could've
killed him. He didn't have to hit him.

1411
01:19:13,932 --> 01:19:16,852
It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1412
01:19:16,892 --> 01:19:19,692
He makes me sneak around to see
my own friends. What is that all about?

1413
01:19:19,732 --> 01:19:23,821
I guess it's 'cause he loves
you so much, he's jealous and worried.

1414
01:19:23,861 --> 01:19:26,531
He gives a fuck what I do.

1415
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:30,410
Look, I'll try to find out
what the hell is going on.

1416
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:33,370
- When I see him, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.

1417
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,539
- All right?
- Yeah.

1418
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:40,079
Thanks. Thanks for putting up with me.

1419
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:43,919
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.

1420
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:48,218
You're a beautiful girl. I've seen a lot
of girls get shot to hell from this.

1421
01:19:48,298 --> 01:19:51,218
You're so nice.

1422
01:19:51,338 --> 01:19:55,888
Come on, now. I don't
wanna see you unhappy.

1423
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:59,637
# These eyes before us # - Thanks.

1424
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:02,397
# Just what the truth is #

1425
01:20:02,437 --> 01:20:04,727
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

1426
01:20:04,817 --> 01:20:07,436
# I can't say anymore #

1427
01:20:07,486 --> 01:20:11,655
# 'Cause I love you #

1428
01:20:11,735 --> 01:20:14,075
# Yes, I love you... ##

1429
01:20:17,905 --> 01:20:21,324
Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner
Pat Webb is here to see you.

1430
01:20:21,414 --> 01:20:23,953
- Give me a minute.
- Okay. Just a minute.

1431
01:20:41,263 --> 01:20:43,761
Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?

1432
01:20:43,851 --> 01:20:46,311
Uh, no. No, thank you, little lady.

1433
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:48,561
Okay, send him in.
Then call me four minutes after.

1434
01:20:48,601 --> 01:20:52,401
- Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
- How do you do?

1435
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:55,400
- Hey, it is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.

1436
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,860
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin' well.

1437
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,489
Hey, all that money is rollin' in.

1438
01:21:01,569 --> 01:21:04,819
I appreciate you takin' the time
to see a poor civil servant.

1439
01:21:04,909 --> 01:21:07,538
- Why don't you have a seat, hmm?
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1440
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:10,998
I come here personally
to kind of smooth over...

1441
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:13,668
any fracas about a certain matter.

1442
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:15,998
See, uh, maybe you didn't know it...

1443
01:21:16,088 --> 01:21:18,957
but Don Ward is a very
well-liked man in this town.

1444
01:21:19,047 --> 01:21:22,966
He's got lots of friends. Nice family
and their money go back many, many years.

1445
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:27,007
Now friends vote. Family and money votes.

1446
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:30,016
That's important to me and you.

1447
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:34,596
And if you'll think about
our little problem along them lines...

1448
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:37,566
and you'll forgive me for sayin' it...

1449
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:40,934
maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

1450
01:21:41,064 --> 01:21:43,354
I'm sorry, but he knew
about our getting hit...

1451
01:21:43,444 --> 01:21:45,794
on three big machines in a row,
and he did nothing about it.

1452
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:50,694
That means, either he was in on it or he
was too dumb to see what was goin' on.

1453
01:21:50,824 --> 01:21:53,743
Either way, I cannot have
a man like that working here.

1454
01:21:53,863 --> 01:21:56,533
Before we point the dirty
end of the stick at old Don...

1455
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:59,412
we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

1456
01:21:59,452 --> 01:22:02,212
Believe me, if I could prove it,
he would be under arrest.

1457
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,211
Are, uh...

1458
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:09,051
Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board...

1459
01:22:09,171 --> 01:22:12,921
eyeballing your record and
your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro.

1460
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,721
I think you're way out of line
talking to me like that.

1461
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,180
What you're saying is libelous, and you're
in no position to challenge my expertise.

1462
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,560
I went way out of my way
to be very helpful to that kid.

1463
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:27,099
He's weak. He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.

1464
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:29,319
There's not much more I can do for him.

1465
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:32,109
You have got me there.

1466
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:35,448
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.

1467
01:22:35,488 --> 01:22:39,407
But he is my brother-in-law...

1468
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,247
and I would look on it
as a personal favor...

1469
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:45,407
if you'd think some more
on hirin' him back.

1470
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:47,667
I can't do that.

1471
01:22:47,747 --> 01:22:50,246
I appreciate the fact
that he's your brother-in-law...

1472
01:22:50,286 --> 01:22:53,086
and I do want to help you
and I like to do favors.

1473
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:56,085
I know who you are, but I cannot do that.

1474
01:22:56,125 --> 01:23:00,214
Well, could there be any position...

1475
01:23:00,294 --> 01:23:03,214
farther down the trough?

1476
01:23:05,135 --> 01:23:07,135
I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

1477
01:23:07,185 --> 01:23:11,394
He's too incompetent, and the bottom
line is, he cannot be trusted.

1478
01:23:13,473 --> 01:23:16,523
Okay. Thanks.

1479
01:23:16,603 --> 01:23:19,523
Well... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.

1480
01:23:20,983 --> 01:23:24,112
Mr. Rothstein, your people
never will understand...

1481
01:23:24,152 --> 01:23:26,532
the way it works out here.

1482
01:23:26,612 --> 01:23:29,742
You're all just our guests.

1483
01:23:29,822 --> 01:23:32,121
But you act like you're at home.

1484
01:23:32,161 --> 01:23:36,120
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.

1485
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,580
But that's where we're gonna send you
if it harelips the governor.

1486
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,169
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.

1487
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:48,839
- Sorry.
- You bet.

1488
01:23:52,718 --> 01:23:55,059
What happened to my pills?

1489
01:23:55,139 --> 01:23:57,058
Huh?

1490
01:23:57,138 --> 01:24:01,018
Isn't it bad enough you're drinking
too much? You're taking my pills too?

1491
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:03,018
I didn't take your pills.

1492
01:24:03,108 --> 01:24:06,318
Look, for my ulcer,
I take a half a one of these.

1493
01:24:06,358 --> 01:24:08,526
And that's when I have extreme pain.

1494
01:24:08,566 --> 01:24:12,196
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with 'em?

1495
01:24:12,236 --> 01:24:14,906
You didn't have to beat him up.

1496
01:24:15,036 --> 01:24:16,946
What?

1497
01:24:17,036 --> 01:24:19,325
I was just trying to help him.

1498
01:24:19,365 --> 01:24:21,995
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1499
01:24:22,035 --> 01:24:24,205
Yeah, how do I know?

1500
01:24:24,245 --> 01:24:26,794
You can't make me stop caring about people.

1501
01:24:26,834 --> 01:24:28,874
What? What?

1502
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:32,883
I said, you can't make me...

1503
01:24:32,923 --> 01:24:36,303
stop caring about people.

1504
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:45,642
Listen... Ginger...

1505
01:24:45,722 --> 01:24:48,942
I'm trying to make the best
of everything here, you know?

1506
01:24:49,022 --> 01:24:51,562
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.

1507
01:24:51,652 --> 01:24:54,691
I mean, people look up to you in this town.

1508
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,941
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit!

1509
01:24:57,991 --> 01:25:01,991
I'm gettin' out of here. I am.

1510
01:25:05,829 --> 01:25:09,459
Come over here.
You gotta get hold of yourself.

1511
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:12,459
- Okay. Okay.
- If not for me, at least for Amy.

1512
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:15,709
Understand? Your drinking's
gettin' way out of hand.

1513
01:25:15,749 --> 01:25:19,168
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.

1514
01:25:19,258 --> 01:25:22,178
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

1515
01:25:22,258 --> 01:25:24,927
There's no names in the papers.

1516
01:25:24,967 --> 01:25:29,306
That's all you care about.
You don't care about me.

1517
01:25:29,346 --> 01:25:31,436
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1518
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:33,557
How could you say that?

1519
01:25:33,597 --> 01:25:36,567
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.

1520
01:25:36,607 --> 01:25:39,566
You don't need that fuckin'
leech living off you.

1521
01:25:39,606 --> 01:25:42,605
I know you better than you know yourself.

1522
01:25:42,695 --> 01:25:45,115
You're a tiger. You're stronger than I am.

1523
01:25:45,195 --> 01:25:49,495
When you set your mind on doing
something, you do it better than anybody.

1524
01:25:53,164 --> 01:25:55,914
You're gonna do it. Okay? You'll do it.

1525
01:25:55,994 --> 01:25:58,494
Oh, God.

1526
01:25:58,624 --> 01:26:01,463
Oh, God.

1527
01:26:01,543 --> 01:26:04,962
Okay.

1528
01:26:07,002 --> 01:26:09,552
I'll try. I'll try.

1529
01:26:09,592 --> 01:26:14,341
I'll try. I will.

1530
01:26:14,431 --> 01:26:17,351
Don't be mad at me, okay?

1531
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:19,310
I will.

1532
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,070
No matter what the problems
were outside the count room...

1533
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:34,410
it was all worth it.

1534
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:37,868
The cash kept rollin' in...

1535
01:26:37,908 --> 01:26:40,698
and the suitcases kept comin' and goin'.

1536
01:26:40,748 --> 01:26:45,288
And let me tell you, the fuckin'
bottom line here is... cash.

1537
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:49,167
The only problem was that after a while...

1538
01:26:49,297 --> 01:26:53,837
the bosses noticed that the suitcases
were gettin' a little light.

1539
01:26:53,877 --> 01:26:56,546
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...

1540
01:26:56,636 --> 01:26:59,505
that the money we're robbing
is being robbed?

1541
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:01,515
Somebody's robbing from us?

1542
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:04,185
We go through all this trouble
and somebody's robbing us?

1543
01:27:04,225 --> 01:27:05,765
Huh?

1544
01:27:05,895 --> 01:27:09,475
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.

1545
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:11,894
Leakage my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.

1546
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:14,734
Even John Nash...
that's the guy who ran the scam...

1547
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:17,194
he knew there wasn't much
he could do about it.

1548
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:19,614
You gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal...

1549
01:27:19,694 --> 01:27:21,903
even if you take care of him real well...

1550
01:27:21,943 --> 01:27:24,113
he's gonna steal
a little extra for himself.

1551
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:26,113
Makes sense, don't it?

1552
01:27:26,203 --> 01:27:29,743
Try and make these hardheaded
old greaseballs understand that.

1553
01:27:29,783 --> 01:27:34,251
What's the point of skimming if we're
being skimmed? It defeats the purpose.

1554
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,831
Huh?

1555
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:39,711
They take this money because they're
my guys, so give 'em some leeway.

1556
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:42,131
But the bosses never believed in leeway...

1557
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:44,260
so listen to what they do.

1558
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,260
They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K. C...

1559
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,720
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

1560
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,349
- What were you doin'?
- I was with my cumma.

1561
01:27:53,429 --> 01:27:55,888
- What are you doin' with your cumma?
- I gave her a scheff.

1562
01:27:55,978 --> 01:27:58,348
The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

1563
01:27:58,438 --> 01:28:01,728
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

1564
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,569
- What you been doin'?
- I'm out there more than I'm here.

1565
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:07,028
And little did anybody know
where this would lead.

1566
01:28:07,108 --> 01:28:10,658
If they did, they'd would've
been better off makin' fuckin' novena.

1567
01:28:10,777 --> 01:28:12,947
You gotta go back there
and talk to that guy.

1568
01:28:13,077 --> 01:28:15,677
- I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
- What expenses?

1569
01:28:15,747 --> 01:28:20,076
I'm layin' money outta my own pocket,
and I never get anything back.

1570
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:22,126
You gotta go back out there.

1571
01:28:22,246 --> 01:28:24,706
From now on, I'm gonna
start keepin' records.

1572
01:28:24,796 --> 01:28:28,426
No records, Artie. What are
you gonna do with records, pay taxes?

1573
01:28:28,466 --> 01:28:30,924
I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough.

1574
01:28:31,004 --> 01:28:33,424
What the hell are we doin' over here?

1575
01:28:33,554 --> 01:28:36,474
You're goin' to Las Vegas at my expense.

1576
01:28:36,514 --> 01:28:38,434
Oh, fuck. I mean, after all...

1577
01:28:38,514 --> 01:28:40,973
No matter how many novenas
you could make...

1578
01:28:41,103 --> 01:28:43,223
nothing was gonna stop what came up next.

1579
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:46,023
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- We made a deal.

1580
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:48,902
It turned out Phil Green, Mr. Integrity...

1581
01:28:48,982 --> 01:28:50,982
had a partner nobody knew about.

1582
01:28:51,112 --> 01:28:54,322
And when she showed up
and started demanding money...

1583
01:28:54,442 --> 01:28:57,702
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're wrong.

1584
01:28:57,742 --> 01:28:59,782
- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not wrong.

1585
01:28:59,822 --> 01:29:02,072
Green tried to stonewall her.

1586
01:29:02,162 --> 01:29:04,951
I will see to it that you
do not get away with this.

1587
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:07,080
So, she sued him in court.

1588
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,500
The court will now hear the matter
of the plaintiff, Anna Scott...

1589
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:13,540
against Tangiers Corporation
and its president, Phil Green.

1590
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:17,169
- Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
- Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1591
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:19,509
- Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.

1592
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,679
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1593
01:29:22,759 --> 01:29:24,719
We got a problem.

1594
01:29:28,137 --> 01:29:31,017
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books...

1595
01:29:31,057 --> 01:29:33,437
has to show how he got the financing.

1596
01:29:33,517 --> 01:29:35,397
Hey, that's not good.

1597
01:29:38,356 --> 01:29:41,447
She was doin' pretty good with her lawsuit.

1598
01:29:41,527 --> 01:29:43,867
But before she could start
countin' her money...

1599
01:29:43,907 --> 01:29:46,696
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1600
01:29:46,736 --> 01:29:48,826
So they sent me.

1601
01:30:03,963 --> 01:30:06,883
Can you comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1602
01:30:06,963 --> 01:30:10,553
- What are you talking about?
- She was found last night shot in the head.

1603
01:30:10,633 --> 01:30:12,762
Was this just a real estate partnership?

1604
01:30:12,802 --> 01:30:14,932
Her lawyer said you were partners.

1605
01:30:14,972 --> 01:30:18,722
We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.

1606
01:30:18,852 --> 01:30:21,392
It was never a partnership.

1607
01:30:21,522 --> 01:30:24,440
Did you ever hear
of the. 22 Caliber Killer?

1608
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,440
Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1609
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,780
they started looking at Green too.

1610
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,611
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1611
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:35,580
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1612
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:37,910
the casino was on the up-and-up.

1613
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:40,539
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1614
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:45,459
Green's here about
two or three times a month...

1615
01:30:45,494 --> 01:30:48,048
and he's busy with real estate deals.

1616
01:30:48,128 --> 01:30:51,128
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

1617
01:30:51,218 --> 01:30:54,258
I serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board.

1618
01:30:54,388 --> 01:30:59,806
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1619
01:30:59,846 --> 01:31:02,056
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1620
01:31:02,096 --> 01:31:05,806
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1621
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:08,645
when Mr. Green is away.

1622
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:12,395
You could say that.

1623
01:31:12,985 --> 01:31:14,485
Hmm, have you read this?

1624
01:31:16,445 --> 01:31:18,484
About Mr. Rothstein.

1625
01:31:18,524 --> 01:31:21,364
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

1626
01:31:21,444 --> 01:31:23,914
says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million...

1627
01:31:23,994 --> 01:31:26,664
Tangiers casino empire."

1628
01:31:26,704 --> 01:31:28,874
Did he really say that?

1629
01:31:28,954 --> 01:31:32,163
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.

1630
01:31:32,213 --> 01:31:36,213
Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

1631
01:31:36,292 --> 01:31:38,962
I don't know. We have to check the files.

1632
01:31:39,002 --> 01:31:41,512
Without gettin' your shorts
in a knot, would you do that?

1633
01:31:41,552 --> 01:31:45,641
And kinda check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass outta town.

1634
01:31:45,681 --> 01:31:47,641
Thank you.

1635
01:31:49,511 --> 01:31:51,891
A Gaming Control Board investigation...

1636
01:31:52,021 --> 01:31:54,230
of Tangiers executive
Sam Rothstein's application...

1637
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:56,769
for a gaming license is underway.

1638
01:31:56,899 --> 01:32:00,609
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino
operation and is a boyhood friend...

1639
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:03,109
of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro...

1640
01:32:03,149 --> 01:32:05,399
could lose his ability
to work in the casino...

1641
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:10,949
Hello?

1642
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:16,118
- I gotta meet Clean Face. What about the Chez Paris?
- You can't.

1643
01:32:16,168 --> 01:32:18,397
- You gotta make a reservation. It's all booked up.
- No, no.

1644
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:21,337
It's impossible.
You gotta make a reservation.

1645
01:32:21,417 --> 01:32:23,337
It's very difficult to get in.

1646
01:32:23,417 --> 01:32:26,337
I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.

1647
01:32:26,427 --> 01:32:29,346
All right.

1648
01:32:29,426 --> 01:32:33,345
The battle between State gaming
officials and Tangiers Casino boss...

1649
01:32:33,385 --> 01:32:35,845
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

1650
01:32:35,935 --> 01:32:40,104
Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace
Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing...

1651
01:32:40,184 --> 01:32:44,354
despite law enforcement allegations of
Rothstein's organized crime connections.

1652
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:48,944
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged
organized crime figure Nicky Santoro...

1653
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,692
keep Rothstein from running
the Tangiers Casino?

1654
01:32:51,772 --> 01:32:55,782
And can the integrity of state gaming laws
be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

1655
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:59,372
Why don't you take it easy
on that stuff? Huh?

1656
01:32:59,412 --> 01:33:02,163
Come on. Let me help you down.

1657
01:33:02,203 --> 01:33:04,162
We're talking about some stuff.

1658
01:33:04,202 --> 01:33:08,252
At 6:00: Will a boyhood friendship unseat
Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?

1659
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:12,131
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.

1660
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:16,220
Go down. Just... go downst-

1661
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:24,180
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry.

1662
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,729
It's just a political witch hunt.

1663
01:33:30,898 --> 01:33:33,478
Ace.

1664
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,988
Do you want something to drink?

1665
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:38,067
- Charlie, a refill?
- Yeah, great.

1666
01:33:38,107 --> 01:33:41,532
No. Hey, Mr. Clark.
I've been tryin' to reach you.

1667
01:33:41,567 --> 01:33:44,577
- You're tougher to get than the president.
- Well, I've been busy.

1668
01:33:44,657 --> 01:33:47,656
Yeah? At least you could return
my phone calls, though.

1669
01:33:47,746 --> 01:33:51,036
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

1670
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:55,546
And I explained to you that you might
have to take some kind of loss.

1671
01:33:55,586 --> 01:33:57,836
Yeah.

1672
01:33:57,916 --> 01:34:00,835
I think I want my money back.

1673
01:34:00,965 --> 01:34:05,255
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1674
01:34:05,305 --> 01:34:09,514
You know, I think you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

1675
01:34:09,594 --> 01:34:12,143
I think, in all fairness...

1676
01:34:12,223 --> 01:34:16,103
I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

1677
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:20,483
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice
and early, take a walk to the bank...

1678
01:34:20,523 --> 01:34:24,521
and walk in and see, and, uh,
if you don't have my money for me...

1679
01:34:24,611 --> 01:34:27,941
I'll crack your fuckin' head
wide open in front of everybody.

1680
01:34:28,031 --> 01:34:31,611
And just about the time
that I'm comin' out of jail...

1681
01:34:31,701 --> 01:34:35,790
hopefully you'll be comin'
out of your coma.

1682
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:39,461
And guess what? I'll split
your fuckin' head open again.

1683
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:43,710
'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.

1684
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:46,709
That's my business. That's what I do.

1685
01:34:46,839 --> 01:34:51,339
We know what you do. You fuck people
out of money and get away with it.

1686
01:34:51,429 --> 01:34:54,909
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Hey, you fat Irish prick! You put my money to sleep!

1687
01:34:54,929 --> 01:34:57,768
- Get my money, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
- Sam!

1688
01:34:57,848 --> 01:34:59,928
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

1689
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:03,977
I'll be there in the morning. You can
try me, Fatso. You fuckin' try me.

1690
01:35:04,017 --> 01:35:06,977
You think he got the point?

1691
01:35:07,017 --> 01:35:12,406
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for
chrissakes. He's gonna run to the F.B.I.

1692
01:35:12,486 --> 01:35:17,536
That prick's been dodgin' me for three
weeks. You're tryin' to tell me what to do.

1693
01:35:17,616 --> 01:35:21,494
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.
You're outta line. Where's your head?

1694
01:35:21,574 --> 01:35:25,704
Where's my head?
Where's your fuckin' balls?

1695
01:35:25,784 --> 01:35:29,455
I'm tryin' to put somethin' big together
here. You know what I'm talkin' about.

1696
01:35:29,505 --> 01:35:32,334
If you're actin' like this now,
can I depend on you?

1697
01:35:32,424 --> 01:35:37,504
A lot of things gonna change. If you wanna be
there with me, you're gonna have to go my way.

1698
01:35:37,634 --> 01:35:41,053
Listen, Nick, understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1699
01:35:41,133 --> 01:35:44,182
I got a hundred million a year
goin' through the place.

1700
01:35:44,222 --> 01:35:47,012
It's all over if I don't get that license.

1701
01:35:47,102 --> 01:35:50,022
If it goes bad for me,
it's bad for a lot of people.

1702
01:35:50,062 --> 01:35:55,771
Forget about your fuckin' license. I plant
my own flag, you ain't gonna need a license.

1703
01:35:55,861 --> 01:36:00,320
You know, I don't know what it is,
Sammy, but the more I talk to you...

1704
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,680
the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

1705
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:06,659
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right, fine.

1706
01:36:06,699 --> 01:36:09,489
I don't want to be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

1707
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:12,289
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.

1708
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:14,289
I want everything quiet. That's it!

1709
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,747
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

1710
01:36:16,787 --> 01:36:18,858
That's taken out of context.
I had no control over that.

1711
01:36:18,878 --> 01:36:23,588
- Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
- Back home that looks bad.

1712
01:36:23,628 --> 01:36:27,757
Looks bad? Every time you're on
television, I get mentioned. That looks bad.

1713
01:36:27,847 --> 01:36:30,597
- What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to me?

1714
01:36:30,637 --> 01:36:32,657
- What happened to you? You lost control.
- I lost control?

1715
01:36:32,677 --> 01:36:35,646
Look at you, you're fuckin' walkin'
around like John Barrymore.

1716
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:40,725
A pink robe and a fuckin'
cigarette holder? I lost control?

1717
01:36:40,815 --> 01:36:45,565
I don't wanna bring this up, but you been
treatin' people with disrespect, even your wife.

1718
01:36:45,605 --> 01:36:48,565
My wife? What does she have
to do with this?

1719
01:36:48,615 --> 01:36:54,113
She was upset about a lot of things, especially
that whole fuckin' Lester Diamond incident.

1720
01:36:54,203 --> 01:36:58,033
You're the shoulder to cry on? Did you her
tell about your little role in that situation?

1721
01:36:58,123 --> 01:37:00,413
No, that's not the fuckin' point.

1722
01:37:00,493 --> 01:37:04,212
- The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
- I would appreciate it...

1723
01:37:04,252 --> 01:37:06,212
if you stay out of my personal life.

1724
01:37:06,252 --> 01:37:10,093
- You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
- She came to talk to me.

1725
01:37:10,173 --> 01:37:12,463
What was I supposed to do? Throw her out?

1726
01:37:12,513 --> 01:37:15,721
- Stay away from her. It's none of your business.
- It's none of my business?

1727
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:20,931
A week ago it was. Now it's none of my
business. When you need me, you need me.

1728
01:37:21,011 --> 01:37:23,771
The way you need me
to vouch for you as a citizen.

1729
01:37:23,851 --> 01:37:26,600
I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you did with this guy.

1730
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:29,610
This guy is gonna run to the F.B.I. Now.

1731
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:31,609
Your head's bigger than your casino.

1732
01:37:31,689 --> 01:37:35,608
I knew what
he wanted. Nicky wanted to take over.

1733
01:37:35,738 --> 01:37:40,618
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

1734
01:37:40,658 --> 01:37:44,448
Plus, he had stopped asking permission
from back home for every little thing.

1735
01:37:48,327 --> 01:37:54,006
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.

1736
01:37:54,046 --> 01:37:56,966
A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

1737
01:37:57,046 --> 01:38:01,256
A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the
trunks of their cars. They questioned Nicky.

1738
01:38:01,346 --> 01:38:03,256
A lawyer.

1739
01:38:03,346 --> 01:38:07,016
They questioned Nicky.

1740
01:38:07,096 --> 01:38:10,264
When some guys that didn't pay
their shylocks began disappearing...

1741
01:38:10,344 --> 01:38:13,264
Nicky's name was in every one
of those newspapers.

1742
01:38:13,354 --> 01:38:17,194
Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let him go.

1743
01:38:17,274 --> 01:38:19,194
There were never any witnesses.

1744
01:38:19,274 --> 01:38:22,323
The coppers blamed me
for everything that went wrong.

1745
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:25,113
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over, there.

1746
01:38:25,193 --> 01:38:29,112
If a guy fuckin' tripped over a
banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.

1747
01:38:29,202 --> 01:38:31,122
Come on, be nice, huh?

1748
01:38:31,202 --> 01:38:35,291
And the bosses were no better. They
complained because things don't run smooth.

1749
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:38,791
In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

1750
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:40,961
I'm dealin' with degenerate
animals out here.

1751
01:38:41,001 --> 01:38:42,961
But the bosses, what do they give a fuck?

1752
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:45,460
They're sittin' on their asses
drinkin' anisette.

1753
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:48,130
I'm the guy in the trenches.

1754
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:51,720
Fuckin' bosses think it's
a fuckin' free lunch out here.

1755
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,889
Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

1756
01:38:55,969 --> 01:38:57,889
You know about that?

1757
01:38:57,979 --> 01:39:00,559
- Yeah, I heard. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1758
01:39:00,599 --> 01:39:04,519
Everybody's talkin'. They're makin' a big
deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

1759
01:39:04,609 --> 01:39:07,237
What are you gonna do?

1760
01:39:07,277 --> 01:39:13,117
And I mean, that's no good. You gotta tell
him to take care of things a little better.

1761
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:15,537
I'll tell him, Remo.

1762
01:39:15,577 --> 01:39:17,946
Fuckin' bosses;
they're smokin' their Di Nobilis...

1763
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:21,286
and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin'
suffritte, you know, fried pigs' guts.

1764
01:39:21,366 --> 01:39:24,785
If I want to talk private,
I gotta go to a bus stop.

1765
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:29,254
- What do they care long as I keep sendin' money back?
- They're complainin'.

1766
01:39:29,334 --> 01:39:33,174
Let 'em complain. I'm the one
who's here. I do all the work.

1767
01:39:33,254 --> 01:39:37,715
- Somebody don't like it, fuck 'em.
- It's up to you.

1768
01:39:37,845 --> 01:39:40,764
They want a fuckin' war? I'm ready.

1769
01:39:40,844 --> 01:39:44,763
All I gotta do is take care of five of
those guys. The rest will fall into place.

1770
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:47,973
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.

1771
01:39:48,063 --> 01:39:50,943
I see you, you motherfuckers.

1772
01:39:50,983 --> 01:39:54,902
Nicky was not only bringing
heat on himself but on me too.

1773
01:39:54,942 --> 01:39:59,322
The F.B.I. Watched every move he made,
but he didn't care. He just didn't care.

1774
01:39:59,402 --> 01:40:02,411
If they're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch 'em right back.

1775
01:40:02,451 --> 01:40:05,530
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar. Who gives a shit?

1776
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:10,040
I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment from
the same places that sell to the fuckin' C.I.A.

1777
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:15,919
I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I.
De-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.

1778
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:21,338
And because of that, the miserable sons
of bitches never caught me doin' anything.

1779
01:40:21,418 --> 01:40:25,678
I got my job on the line, and
this guy's havin' the time of his life.

1780
01:40:25,718 --> 01:40:29,638
He has every cop in the state
watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.

1781
01:40:29,678 --> 01:40:32,728
And at the worst possible time for me.

1782
01:40:32,808 --> 01:40:36,398
I had my license hearing coming up, and
I didn't want to leave anything to chance.

1783
01:40:36,438 --> 01:40:40,321
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

1784
01:40:40,356 --> 01:40:43,316
You've been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.

1785
01:40:43,396 --> 01:40:46,316
That's gonna mean something
when you go before the commission.

1786
01:40:46,406 --> 01:40:50,745
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.

1787
01:40:50,825 --> 01:40:54,455
All right, well, we'll move on to...

1788
01:40:54,495 --> 01:40:59,164
I wanted to hear
something about Kansas City.

1789
01:40:59,204 --> 01:41:01,583
What the fuck is this?

1790
01:41:04,003 --> 01:41:08,213
Where's this guy gonna land, the fairway?

1791
01:41:26,691 --> 01:41:29,231
They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this.

1792
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:34,149
The Feds were watching Nicky
play golf for so long...

1793
01:41:34,199 --> 01:41:36,449
they ran out of gas.

1794
01:41:36,529 --> 01:41:40,199
Just what I needed, right
in front of the Control Board.

1795
01:41:44,909 --> 01:41:48,878
A hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.

1796
01:41:48,958 --> 01:41:54,587
And as if things weren't bad enough, in
comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.

1797
01:41:54,667 --> 01:41:57,566
He ran that little grocery store in Kansas
City where they bought the suitcases.

1798
01:41:57,586 --> 01:42:01,521
Fightin' over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?

1799
01:42:01,556 --> 01:42:04,886
I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and
it's gonna cost me another couple grand.

1800
01:42:04,976 --> 01:42:07,347
He ran it with his brother-in-law...

1801
01:42:07,437 --> 01:42:10,356
but mostly what he did was complain
about his trips to Vegas.

1802
01:42:10,396 --> 01:42:14,815
You gotta lay down the law, otherwise
they're gonna make a fool out of you.

1803
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:18,405
I write it all down. Every fuckin'
nickel goes down. Receipts...

1804
01:42:18,445 --> 01:42:22,154
- Hey, oh, wha... What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.

1805
01:42:22,234 --> 01:42:24,784
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.

1806
01:42:24,864 --> 01:42:28,704
Nance gives me trouble, I'll tell him I'll
take the eyes out of his frickin' head.

1807
01:42:28,784 --> 01:42:31,032
- Again.
- I said, "frickin' head."

1808
01:42:31,082 --> 01:42:33,162
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.

1809
01:42:33,242 --> 01:42:35,162
What happens next? You can't believe it.

1810
01:42:35,252 --> 01:42:37,602
Who would believe that the F.B.I.
Had a wire in the place...

1811
01:42:37,622 --> 01:42:40,132
lookin' for some information
about some old homicide...

1812
01:42:40,212 --> 01:42:44,131
about some guy who was whacked-out
God knows when over God knows what.

1813
01:42:44,211 --> 01:42:47,131
What's to prevent him with the suitcases
that he could take what he wants?

1814
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:50,930
Fuckin' Nance takes back two suitcases
from the Tangiers. What about three or four?

1815
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:54,099
We've got nobody
in the room to watch. That's the law.

1816
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:57,690
We can't even go into the count room to
watch our money. You believe this bullshit?

1817
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:03,610
Sure, he's got his people in there. They
could all be in on it together, those fucks.

1818
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:06,489
I'll find out. If it's Green,
I'll bury that bastard.

1819
01:43:06,609 --> 01:43:10,868
I never trusted him.
They trust that scumbag. I don't.

1820
01:43:10,948 --> 01:43:14,408
- I'll hit the two of them with a fuckin' shovel.
- Take it easy.

1821
01:43:14,488 --> 01:43:16,657
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beatin' me left and right.

1822
01:43:16,787 --> 01:43:19,827
- Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
- I know, but that's enough.

1823
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:22,957
You know what they're doin'. I can't
take this no more. Back and forth.

1824
01:43:23,087 --> 01:43:26,756
- Take it easy. You'll get a heart attack like that.
- I know. I'm too upset.

1825
01:43:26,836 --> 01:43:30,125
And the damn thing is,
they hear all this stuff...

1826
01:43:30,295 --> 01:43:33,545
about Las Vegas
and the casinos and suitcases...

1827
01:43:33,635 --> 01:43:35,635
and that's it.

1828
01:43:41,344 --> 01:43:44,684
Everything's comin' outta my pocket.
I gotta pay.

1829
01:43:44,854 --> 01:43:46,974
Would you believe that
such a thing could happen?

1830
01:43:47,064 --> 01:43:49,984
I'm in this to make money,
not to lose money.

1831
01:43:50,064 --> 01:43:53,863
Every F.B.I. Man across the country
had their ears open now.

1832
01:43:53,983 --> 01:43:56,983
If you want something done right
you gotta do it yourself.

1833
01:43:57,033 --> 01:44:02,492
I mean, Piscano, this guy
basically sunk the whole world.

1834
01:44:02,572 --> 01:44:05,411
There are some that are good
and some that are bad.

1835
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:08,001
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission...

1836
01:44:08,081 --> 01:44:10,671
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

1837
01:44:10,711 --> 01:44:13,420
When the day finally came, I was ready.

1838
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:17,130
I felt so confident that
all I had to do was present my case.

1839
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:22,799
We have documents, one of which is
a report by retired F.B.I. Agents...

1840
01:44:22,929 --> 01:44:25,558
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

1841
01:44:25,678 --> 01:44:29,058
- Counselor, before you continue...
- I want to have this marked...

1842
01:44:29,098 --> 01:44:33,228
This commission is prepared to act on a
motion denying the Rothstein application.

1843
01:44:33,268 --> 01:44:35,819
- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?

1844
01:44:35,939 --> 01:44:37,978
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

1845
01:44:38,068 --> 01:44:40,028
Do I have a vote on the motion?

1846
01:44:40,068 --> 01:44:42,357
- Aye.
- Aye. Aye.

1847
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:44,367
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.

1848
01:44:44,527 --> 01:44:48,236
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned? What do you mean, "Adjourned"?

1849
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:52,786
Senator, you promised me a hearing. You
didn't even look at the F.B.I. Reports.

1850
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:58,756
When you were my guest at the Tangiers
Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?

1851
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:02,714
- I was never your guest.
- You were never my guest? I never comped you?

1852
01:45:02,834 --> 01:45:06,594
- I don't comp you at least three times a month?
- I'd like to answer that.

1853
01:45:06,714 --> 01:45:10,173
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical
to this point. He's lying.

1854
01:45:10,263 --> 01:45:14,433
The only time I was at the Tangiers
was with Barney Greenstein.

1855
01:45:14,553 --> 01:45:17,543
- Was I at that dinner? Tell me, was I at that dinner?
- You were wandering.

1856
01:45:17,563 --> 01:45:20,222
- Was I at that dinner? Was I?
- You were wandering.

1857
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:23,271
- You were... in the... You were in the building.
- I was in the building?

1858
01:45:23,391 --> 01:45:29,152
You know I was at that dinner, and you swore
to me I would have a fair hearing. Did you not?

1859
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:34,951
Did you not? Well, tell me I was at
least at the dinner. Allow me that much.

1860
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:38,870
- Give me that much at least!
- Yes, you were.

1861
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:43,370
Thanks for not calling me a liar,
you son of a bitch. You son of a...

1862
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:46,749
A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday...

1863
01:45:46,919 --> 01:45:49,709
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino
executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

1864
01:45:49,799 --> 01:45:53,469
- What are you runnin' for, Bob?
- Accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.

1865
01:45:53,589 --> 01:45:56,337
You promised me when you were
getting comped at my hotel.

1866
01:45:56,387 --> 01:46:00,007
You were asking me for copies of your bill
so you could put 'em on your expense account.

1867
01:46:00,137 --> 01:46:03,177
In a wild outburst that followed
his gaming license denial...

1868
01:46:03,227 --> 01:46:05,557
- Bullshit! Bullshit!
- Rothstein followed several...

1869
01:46:05,687 --> 01:46:09,316
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue...

1870
01:46:09,436 --> 01:46:11,816
until his own lawyers
and friends urged him to leave.

1871
01:46:11,936 --> 01:46:16,356
You have a past. I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.

1872
01:46:16,406 --> 01:46:18,865
But you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment!

1873
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:22,115
Long suspected of running
the Tangiers without a license...

1874
01:46:22,195 --> 01:46:26,035
yesterday's hearing was to determine
whether someone with Rothstein's history...

1875
01:46:26,165 --> 01:46:29,784
was qualified to officially hold
a top gaming post.

1876
01:46:29,914 --> 01:46:32,664
Fuckin' hypocrites!

1877
01:46:32,704 --> 01:46:36,123
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.

1878
01:46:36,213 --> 01:46:40,133
What's he doin'? He knows all those
guys he yelled at are friends of ours.

1879
01:46:40,213 --> 01:46:42,922
What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

1880
01:46:43,012 --> 01:46:48,142
Maybe he could run things with another
job title. What are we gonna do?

1881
01:46:48,222 --> 01:46:52,471
However he runs things, it's gotta be
quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.

1882
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,640
Say he's a janitor. I don't give a shit.

1883
01:46:55,730 --> 01:47:00,770
But, please, whatever job he takes,
make sure it's something quiet.

1884
01:47:08,450 --> 01:47:10,410
Ladies and gentlemen...

1885
01:47:10,449 --> 01:47:13,159
the Tangiers Hotel
proudly presents the all-new...

1886
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:17,328
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.

1887
01:47:19,878 --> 01:47:22,748
Tonight, taped live
from the all-new Sports Book...

1888
01:47:22,798 --> 01:47:26,378
we present the premiere showing
of Aces High...

1889
01:47:26,508 --> 01:47:30,216
with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra...

1890
01:47:30,256 --> 01:47:32,216
and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!

1891
01:47:34,966 --> 01:47:39,055
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and
the best football handicapper in America;

1892
01:47:39,095 --> 01:47:44,355
a man who will take you inside the real
Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.

1893
01:47:44,435 --> 01:47:48,814
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment
director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...

1894
01:47:48,904 --> 01:47:52,193
Mr. Sam Rothstein.

1895
01:47:59,994 --> 01:48:04,293
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show. We're
very happy to have you here this evening.

1896
01:48:04,373 --> 01:48:07,412
The young lady to my left
is Trudy, who is...

1897
01:48:07,462 --> 01:48:10,422
a lead new dancer
in our fabulous show from Paris.

1898
01:48:10,462 --> 01:48:13,041
Our first guest this evening...

1899
01:48:13,131 --> 01:48:15,801
is Frankie Avalon.

1900
01:48:21,141 --> 01:48:25,140
- Keep an eye on him.
- I've got a large family.

1901
01:48:25,179 --> 01:48:29,889
- How many kids do you have?
- I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.

1902
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:32,939
No, no, please. Please.

1903
01:48:32,979 --> 01:48:37,108
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.

1904
01:48:37,148 --> 01:48:40,778
- Ace, don't do it.
- ##

1905
01:48:40,818 --> 01:48:43,699
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

1906
01:48:43,779 --> 01:48:45,988
Oh, Jesus.

1907
01:48:46,038 --> 01:48:48,327
He's juggling!

1908
01:48:48,407 --> 01:48:52,167
Let's not take Commissioner
Pat Webb too seriously.

1909
01:48:52,247 --> 01:48:55,667
I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

1910
01:48:55,747 --> 01:49:00,426
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.

1911
01:49:00,506 --> 01:49:03,255
You can ask me anything you want.

1912
01:49:03,295 --> 01:49:06,215
What the hell is he doin'
on television, anyway?

1913
01:49:06,305 --> 01:49:11,514
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's
gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

1914
01:49:11,594 --> 01:49:15,104
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

1915
01:49:15,184 --> 01:49:17,894
He's out of his fuckin' mind.

1916
01:49:17,934 --> 01:49:21,143
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.

1917
01:49:21,193 --> 01:49:24,152
Other people have to pay
through the nose. Such is life.

1918
01:49:24,192 --> 01:49:29,992
Andy, go see him. Tell him
maybe it's time he should quit.

1919
01:49:34,952 --> 01:49:37,872
First of all, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

1920
01:49:37,952 --> 01:49:41,711
We're on the list to be heard before
the Supreme Court of the United States.

1921
01:49:41,751 --> 01:49:47,300
These guys don't give a fuck about the
Supreme Court. They want you to walk away.

1922
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:51,880
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can
I walk away? Don't you see what's at stake?

1923
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:55,299
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

1924
01:49:55,389 --> 01:49:58,219
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

1925
01:49:58,259 --> 01:50:01,138
Not only should you quit, you should run.

1926
01:50:01,228 --> 01:50:05,148
Every time they mention my name
in the papers, they mention Nicky too.

1927
01:50:05,228 --> 01:50:07,687
How the fuck does that help?

1928
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:10,687
The heat he brought down is murder.

1929
01:50:10,777 --> 01:50:16,527
The police department was cooperative. He
pissed 'em off. Nobody can make a move anymore.

1930
01:50:16,617 --> 01:50:19,985
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1931
01:50:20,075 --> 01:50:22,906
Maybe he should get lost
for awhile. Would that be so bad?

1932
01:50:22,996 --> 01:50:25,496
- They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break...

1933
01:50:25,576 --> 01:50:27,786
it would give everybody time to maneuver.

1934
01:50:27,876 --> 01:50:32,755
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.

1935
01:50:35,585 --> 01:50:38,424
I can't do that.

1936
01:50:38,464 --> 01:50:42,723
As soon as Andy got home,
Nicky heard about our talk.

1937
01:50:42,763 --> 01:50:45,683
Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

1938
01:50:45,803 --> 01:50:48,683
Great. You know, I've got to do
some shopping. You want to go?

1939
01:50:48,763 --> 01:50:50,933
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy.

1940
01:50:51,023 --> 01:50:54,062
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

1941
01:50:54,102 --> 01:50:59,651
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes.

1942
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:02,531
So on routine calls, they have
to click off after a few minutes.

1943
01:51:02,611 --> 01:51:05,450
Yeah, I got a sprained fuckin' elbow.

1944
01:51:05,490 --> 01:51:07,280
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.

1945
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,910
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards down the road.

1946
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:13,201
- Why?
- Don't ask questions. Just be there.

1947
01:51:14,789 --> 01:51:18,169
Suzy Cream Cheese has
the exact same outfit.

1948
01:51:18,209 --> 01:51:20,959
I saw something.

1949
01:51:20,999 --> 01:51:24,169
Something very cute.

1950
01:51:24,259 --> 01:51:28,298
Okay, he's out. It's the ant. Brown unit.

1951
01:51:28,388 --> 01:51:30,848
And he's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.

1952
01:51:30,883 --> 01:51:33,307
Nicky started out before me...

1953
01:51:33,347 --> 01:51:36,307
because it wasn't that easy
for him to get around.

1954
01:51:36,387 --> 01:51:40,226
Nicky couldn't even go
for a ride without changing cars...

1955
01:51:40,316 --> 01:51:43,526
at least six times
before he could shake all his tails.

1956
01:51:43,566 --> 01:51:46,606
Because of the planes,
he had to use underground garages.

1957
01:52:17,722 --> 01:52:20,682
Meeting in the middle
of the desert always made me nervous.

1958
01:52:20,722 --> 01:52:23,011
It's a scary place.

1959
01:52:23,061 --> 01:52:25,681
I knew about the holes
in the desert, of course.

1960
01:52:25,731 --> 01:52:29,440
And everywhere I looked,
there could have been a hole.

1961
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,150
Normally, my prospects
of comin' back alive...

1962
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:36,149
from a meetin' with Nicky
were 99 out of 100.

1963
01:52:38,069 --> 01:52:43,029
But this time, when I heard him say a
couple of hundred yards down the road...

1964
01:52:43,079 --> 01:52:45,038
I gave myself 50-50.

1965
01:53:04,757 --> 01:53:09,685
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to
people behind my back, goin' over my head?

1966
01:53:09,765 --> 01:53:13,145
- What people?
- What people? What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?

1967
01:53:13,265 --> 01:53:15,185
I don't even know
what you're talkin' about.

1968
01:53:15,275 --> 01:53:20,144
You said I'm bringin' heat on you? I gotta
listen to people because of your shit?

1969
01:53:20,234 --> 01:53:23,524
You're orderin' me out? You better get
your own fuckin' army, pal!

1970
01:53:23,564 --> 01:53:28,033
I didn't order you or anybody. I told Andy
Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.

1971
01:53:28,113 --> 01:53:30,952
- You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?
- Yeah.

1972
01:53:30,992 --> 01:53:33,782
Let the bullshit blow over
so I can run the casino.

1973
01:53:33,832 --> 01:53:37,412
Anything goes wrong with the casino,
it's my ass. It's not yours. It's my ass.

1974
01:53:37,502 --> 01:53:42,172
I don't know whether you know you have your
fuckin' casino because I made that possible!

1975
01:53:42,252 --> 01:53:47,711
I'm what counts out here. Not your fuckin'
country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows!

1976
01:53:47,801 --> 01:53:50,631
And what the fuck
are you doin' on TV anyhow?

1977
01:53:50,721 --> 01:53:54,930
I get calls from home every day.
They think you went batshit!

1978
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:58,850
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able
to hang around the casino. You understand.

1979
01:53:58,930 --> 01:54:02,059
You could have had the food-and-beverage
job without goin' on television!

1980
01:54:02,149 --> 01:54:04,149
You wanted to go on TV.

1981
01:54:04,189 --> 01:54:07,148
Yeah, I wanted to go on TV. That
way I have a forum. I can fight back.

1982
01:54:07,188 --> 01:54:10,948
They know they can't fuck around with me like
they could if I was an unknown. That's right.

1983
01:54:10,988 --> 01:54:13,108
You're makin' a spectacle of yourself.

1984
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:17,117
Me? I wouldn't even be
in this situation if it wasn't for you.

1985
01:54:17,157 --> 01:54:20,077
Every time I meet somebody,
the question is: Do I know you?

1986
01:54:20,157 --> 01:54:23,626
- Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin' license on me.
- No, Nicky.

1987
01:54:23,666 --> 01:54:26,666
When you asked me
if you could come out here...

1988
01:54:26,746 --> 01:54:29,665
what did I tell you? Do you remember?

1989
01:54:29,755 --> 01:54:32,796
- Back up a fuckin' minute here.
- Do you remember what I told you?

1990
01:54:32,836 --> 01:54:37,176
I asked you? When the fuck did
I ever ask you if I could come out here?

1991
01:54:37,256 --> 01:54:41,724
Get this through your head,
you Jew motherfucker, you!

1992
01:54:41,804 --> 01:54:45,804
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!

1993
01:54:45,854 --> 01:54:48,434
Without me, you personally...

1994
01:54:48,514 --> 01:54:53,483
Every fuckin' wise guy still around will
take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass!

1995
01:54:53,523 --> 01:54:56,863
Then where you gonna go?
You're fuckin' warned.

1996
01:54:56,943 --> 01:54:59,942
Don't go over my head again,
you motherfucker, you!

1997
01:55:24,469 --> 01:55:28,219
# Crack that whip #

1998
01:55:28,259 --> 01:55:30,929
- # Give the past the slip #
- Well, we got company.

1999
01:55:31,019 --> 01:55:33,429
# Step on a crack #

2000
01:55:33,519 --> 01:55:36,597
# Break your mama's back #

2001
01:55:38,397 --> 01:55:41,187
# When a problem comes along
you must whip it #

2002
01:55:41,227 --> 01:55:43,187
# Before the preacher talks too long #

2003
01:55:43,237 --> 01:55:45,657
# You must whip it # - Did you see that?

2004
01:55:45,737 --> 01:55:51,576
Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together,
and he's actin' like he don't know me.

2005
01:55:51,616 --> 01:55:54,575
I know we're supposed to avoid each
other, but there's ways to do things.

2006
01:55:54,615 --> 01:55:56,575
Fuck him.

2007
01:55:56,615 --> 01:55:59,204
To Abraham Lincoln.

2008
01:55:59,244 --> 01:56:03,714
- Don't let it bother you.
- Does it look like it's botherin' me?

2009
01:56:03,754 --> 01:56:06,544
Why do I give a fuck?

2010
01:56:06,584 --> 01:56:11,754
That prick. He won't even look over.
What's his fuckin' problem?

2011
01:56:11,804 --> 01:56:16,683
- Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're havin' a good time.

2012
01:56:16,723 --> 01:56:19,763
- So are we.
- # Whip it good ##

2013
01:56:21,432 --> 01:56:25,352
Yeah?

2014
01:56:25,442 --> 01:56:27,942
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?

2015
01:56:27,982 --> 01:56:31,771
The little guy. Nobody told him
he was eighty-sixed from the joint.

2016
01:56:31,861 --> 01:56:34,940
We turned our heads and made out
we didn't know who he was.

2017
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:39,740
He's over at the 21 table
with his nose wide open.

2018
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:43,410
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about 10,000.

2019
01:56:43,450 --> 01:56:46,209
- Now he's really pissed.
- Oh, no.

2020
01:56:46,289 --> 01:56:49,129
- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him ten.

2021
01:56:49,209 --> 01:56:51,288
That's it. I'll be right down.

2022
01:56:51,378 --> 01:56:56,467
- He's gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.
- No, 50,000. I said 50!

2023
01:56:56,547 --> 01:57:01,598
Go get it. I don't give a fuck where you get
it. Fuckers. They take but don't give back.

2024
01:57:01,638 --> 01:57:05,848
# I ain't got a home I got a phone ##

2025
01:57:05,928 --> 01:57:10,556
How the fuck can you grin?
How the fuck can you grin?

2026
01:57:10,646 --> 01:57:14,566
You know how much I'm stuck?
You give a fuck? Do you?

2027
01:57:17,985 --> 01:57:21,155
Give yourself a hand,
right across your fuckin' mouth.

2028
01:57:21,235 --> 01:57:23,155
Look at this beaut they put in now.

2029
01:57:23,235 --> 01:57:25,160
Sherbert send you to rob me now?

2030
01:57:25,195 --> 01:57:30,163
Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick
all night? Been beating the customers?

2031
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:32,453
Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

2032
01:57:35,163 --> 01:57:38,873
Take this stiff and pound it
up your fuckin' ass.

2033
01:57:38,923 --> 01:57:41,672
Hit me again.

2034
01:57:44,802 --> 01:57:49,682
Take this one and stick it
up your sister's ass. Hit me again.

2035
01:57:49,722 --> 01:57:54,601
That's it. Keep lookin' at him. If you had any
heart at all, you'd be stealin' for a livin'.

2036
01:57:54,681 --> 01:57:58,231
Hit me again! What the fuck
you keep lookin' at him for?

2037
01:57:58,351 --> 01:58:02,151
You fuckin'... Look at this, 20 fuckin'
paints in a row. Hit me again.

2038
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:11,409
You should pay as fast
as you collect, you know.

2039
01:58:13,909 --> 01:58:18,538
- You gotta get outta here.
- Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.

2040
01:58:18,618 --> 01:58:21,708
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.

2041
01:58:21,828 --> 01:58:25,747
- Just give me the money. Give me the fuckin' money.
- I'm gonna okay you ten.

2042
01:58:25,837 --> 01:58:28,796
Then you gotta get out
before the cops are all over you.

2043
01:58:28,916 --> 01:58:31,676
Ten and that's it.

2044
01:58:35,216 --> 01:58:39,726
What are you starin' at,
you bald-headed Jew prick?

2045
01:58:43,475 --> 01:58:48,025
- Come on, come on. Let's get outta here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!

2046
01:58:48,105 --> 01:58:51,564
Get outta here?
I got a marker comin'. Deal.

2047
01:58:51,694 --> 01:58:54,524
Everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.

2048
01:58:54,614 --> 01:58:58,444
You're asking for alimony payments
and child support, and now custody.

2049
01:58:58,574 --> 01:59:00,862
I just want what any
divorced woman would get.

2050
01:59:00,992 --> 01:59:02,862
She's only sober about two hours a day.

2051
01:59:02,992 --> 01:59:05,102
It's usually from 11:00 in the morning
'til 1:00 in the afternoon.

2052
01:59:05,122 --> 01:59:09,622
If I gave her her money and her jewels,
she's gonna piss it all away in a year.

2053
01:59:09,662 --> 01:59:13,921
Where would you be then?
Comin' right back to me...

2054
01:59:14,041 --> 01:59:18,761
- or findin' some other excuse to come...
- We had a deal.

2055
01:59:18,881 --> 01:59:20,760
Remember that?

2056
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,299
He said if it didn't work out between us,
I could get my things, and I could leave.

2057
01:59:27,099 --> 01:59:29,390
Look in my eyes.

2058
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:33,600
Look-Look in my eyes. You know me.

2059
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:37,109
Do you see anything that makes
you think I would ever let...

2060
01:59:37,189 --> 01:59:41,528
someone in your condition
take my child away from me?

2061
01:59:41,648 --> 01:59:43,528
Do you?

2062
01:59:46,317 --> 01:59:48,787
You know that won't happen.

2063
01:59:51,287 --> 01:59:54,367
And after all this time...

2064
01:59:54,497 --> 01:59:58,205
and as hard as I tried,
as much as I wanted...

2065
01:59:58,335 --> 02:00:00,205
I could never reach her.

2066
02:00:00,335 --> 02:00:02,415
I could never make her love me.

2067
02:00:02,505 --> 02:00:06,045
I always felt she should have gone
for all that money...

2068
02:00:06,135 --> 02:00:08,385
being somebody
for the first time in her life...

2069
02:00:08,504 --> 02:00:10,674
a home, a kid.

2070
02:00:10,804 --> 02:00:13,224
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.

2071
02:00:13,344 --> 02:00:15,264
- Everything all right?
I mean, what could we do?

2072
02:00:15,343 --> 02:00:19,224
After a while, we'd just take breathers
from each other. Little separations.

2073
02:00:19,354 --> 02:00:22,933
At that time, I remember Ginger
took Amy to Beverly Hills.

2074
02:00:23,023 --> 02:00:24,893
She was gonna spend a week shopping.

2075
02:00:25,023 --> 02:00:28,483
- Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
- Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.

2076
02:00:28,903 --> 02:00:31,402
- Beverly Hotel.
- Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

2077
02:00:31,482 --> 02:00:35,071
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein
have checked out already.

2078
02:00:35,201 --> 02:00:37,951
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein?

2079
02:00:37,991 --> 02:00:40,791
Hey, little Dale Evans.

2080
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:43,450
- Yes, they both checked out.
- Thank you.

2081
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,840
Hello. Yeah.

2082
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:54,008
My wife is with an old friend
of hers in L.A.

2083
02:00:54,048 --> 02:00:56,678
Some lowlife. A guy named Lester Diamond.

2084
02:00:56,718 --> 02:00:59,548
My daughter is with them, and I think
they're gonna try and kidnap her.

2085
02:00:59,598 --> 02:01:03,388
- Is there anybody you can send?
- We'll take care of it.

2086
02:01:08,188 --> 02:01:10,268
We got a number and an address.

2087
02:01:10,358 --> 02:01:13,987
- Hello. Is this Lester?
- Hello.

2088
02:01:14,107 --> 02:01:16,357
Who's calling?

2089
02:01:16,397 --> 02:01:19,316
This is Sam Rothstein. I want to talk
to Ginger. Put her on the phone.

2090
02:01:19,406 --> 02:01:21,366
She's not here, Sam.

2091
02:01:21,446 --> 02:01:24,246
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.

2092
02:01:24,286 --> 02:01:28,115
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.

2093
02:01:28,245 --> 02:01:31,414
- I know she's there. Don't fuck around.
- Sam, I wouldn't.

2094
02:01:31,454 --> 02:01:33,584
You shouldn't do this.

2095
02:01:33,624 --> 02:01:35,794
- You understand?
Put her on the fuckin' phone.

2096
02:01:35,874 --> 02:01:39,254
Sam, I don't know where she is.

2097
02:01:39,384 --> 02:01:43,553
So... listen... Can I call you back?

2098
02:01:43,593 --> 02:01:47,223
- 702-472-1862.
- Mm-hmm. 1862.

2099
02:01:47,303 --> 02:01:49,262
- Okay, I'll call you right back.
- Right away.

2100
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:51,391
- Right back.
- You got it.

2101
02:01:51,431 --> 02:01:55,931
Schmuck. All right,
I just bought us a few minutes.

2102
02:01:55,981 --> 02:01:58,102
You want to get back at this prick? Hmm?

2103
02:01:58,192 --> 02:02:01,562
- Okay, you got what?
Two million in that box?

2104
02:02:01,652 --> 02:02:04,821
Hey, you got a minute? He's got
two million in the box, am I right?

2105
02:02:04,861 --> 02:02:06,821
You let him keep your jewels.

2106
02:02:06,861 --> 02:02:10,160
We take the cash and the only other
thing he cares about. Huh? Her majesty.

2107
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:13,200
We go to Europe. You dye your hair.

2108
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:16,999
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see "The Elephant Man."

2109
02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:20,709
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk. You dye your hair.

2110
02:02:20,789 --> 02:02:22,959
You get plastic surgery
like we talked about.

2111
02:02:22,999 --> 02:02:25,648
You're the mother. How much you think
he'll pay to get this kid back?

2112
02:02:25,668 --> 02:02:28,817
- I don't want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth. You know where she gets this?

2113
02:02:28,837 --> 02:02:30,797
- You shut up.
You want me to come over there?

2114
02:02:30,837 --> 02:02:32,967
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!

2115
02:02:33,007 --> 02:02:36,386
This has always been a dream,
but now we're going.

2116
02:02:36,466 --> 02:02:39,746
- Lester, he called you here. He called you right here.
- That's who was on the phone.

2117
02:02:39,766 --> 02:02:42,186
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.

2118
02:02:42,226 --> 02:02:44,935
That means he's sending some guys
over here, probably right now.

2119
02:02:45,015 --> 02:02:47,686
It means he's sitting
by the phone, like a dumbbell...

2120
02:02:47,775 --> 02:02:51,695
- waiting for me to call him back.
- He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.

2121
02:02:51,775 --> 02:02:55,655
What do you think we're gonna do? He's
probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!

2122
02:02:55,695 --> 02:02:59,614
- This is fuckin' bullshit! This is bullshit!
- Get your bag! Let's go!

2123
02:02:59,704 --> 02:03:03,993
- Oh, what bullshit? What? You want to talk it over now?
- Okay, you done yakkin'?

2124
02:03:04,033 --> 02:03:06,203
- Go, go! Get in the car!
- Go, go, go.

2125
02:03:06,293 --> 02:03:08,293
Just relax. Nobody's killing anybody.

2126
02:03:08,373 --> 02:03:10,462
I think he's gonna kill me. - Just relax.

2127
02:03:10,542 --> 02:03:15,252
Call me back here in exactly an hour
on this phone. I'll see what I can do.

2128
02:03:15,342 --> 02:03:17,422
I'm gonna call you back
in an hour at this number...

2129
02:03:17,512 --> 02:03:19,722
- and you're gonna be there, right?
- I'll be here.

2130
02:03:19,802 --> 02:03:24,350
Listen, don't do anything else crazy,
okay? You all right? Okay.

2131
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:26,350
Bye.

2132
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:28,450
- Just knock it off. You two knock it off.
- She started it.

2133
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:30,460
- She started the whole thing. I'm just standing here.
- Get in the car.

2134
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,540
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think
you're gonna drive. I'm gonna drive.

2135
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,209
- I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.
- You're driving me nuts!

2136
02:03:35,229 --> 02:03:39,030
Get on the passenger side! And I'm
sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!

2137
02:03:55,838 --> 02:03:57,747
Can we...

2138
02:04:04,586 --> 02:04:08,255
# You can go your own way #

2139
02:04:08,305 --> 02:04:11,135
# Go your own way #

2140
02:04:11,225 --> 02:04:13,345
# Tell me why #

2141
02:04:13,435 --> 02:04:17,265
- # Everything turned around #
- Ginger called me.

2142
02:04:17,355 --> 02:04:21,893
Yeah.

2143
02:04:21,943 --> 02:04:25,103
- I just told you she called me.
- What'd she want?

2144
02:04:25,193 --> 02:04:28,864
She was afraid to call you.

2145
02:04:28,944 --> 02:04:34,363
- She's with that cocksucker. They got Amy.
- That's why I'm here.

2146
02:04:34,453 --> 02:04:36,603
She wants to come back, but she's
afraid you're gonna whack her out.

2147
02:04:36,623 --> 02:04:39,872
- They're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
- I know.

2148
02:04:39,952 --> 02:04:44,331
Why didn't you come to me? I mean,
this is family. It ain't business.

2149
02:04:44,421 --> 02:04:48,551
You make calls back home. It makes us
look bad out here. You know what I mean?

2150
02:04:48,631 --> 02:04:50,591
Back and forth, this one and that one.

2151
02:04:50,631 --> 02:04:52,761
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.

2152
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,930
Am I right?

2153
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:58,099
What am I going to do with this woman?

2154
02:04:58,139 --> 02:05:02,389
- Driving me fuckin' crazy.
- I think if you, uh...

2155
02:05:02,479 --> 02:05:06,858
assure her that she's gonna be
all right, she'll come back.

2156
02:05:06,938 --> 02:05:09,768
Driving me fuckin' crazy.

2157
02:05:09,818 --> 02:05:11,898
Once you get her here, you think about it.

2158
02:05:11,988 --> 02:05:15,357
Wait 'til you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.

2159
02:05:15,447 --> 02:05:17,777
That's the main thing here.

2160
02:05:17,817 --> 02:05:21,737
You want your kid, don't you? Huh?

2161
02:05:21,827 --> 02:05:25,787
Hello.

2162
02:05:25,827 --> 02:05:30,666
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted
to talk to, right?

2163
02:05:30,746 --> 02:05:33,295
Listen, I'm not gonna
ask you where you are.

2164
02:05:33,335 --> 02:05:37,755
Just, please, put Amy on a plane,
any plane, to get her here right away.

2165
02:05:37,835 --> 02:05:40,804
- That's all I'm asking.
- Do you...

2166
02:05:40,844 --> 02:05:43,554
I mean, I don't think
she should go by herself.

2167
02:05:43,634 --> 02:05:47,554
What do you mean?

2168
02:05:47,644 --> 02:05:49,554
What I mean is...

2169
02:05:49,644 --> 02:05:54,732
Do you think if I came back...

2170
02:05:54,812 --> 02:05:57,062
Do you think you could forgive me?

2171
02:05:57,152 --> 02:06:01,151
I gotta tell you, I don't know.

2172
02:06:01,191 --> 02:06:03,231
I understand that.

2173
02:06:03,321 --> 02:06:05,401
I know I fucked up.

2174
02:06:05,492 --> 02:06:09,662
- What about the money? Where's the box?
- I gotta tell ya...

2175
02:06:09,702 --> 02:06:14,540
I made some mistakes,
and I spent some money.

2176
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:17,790
- What's it under?
- Pretty serious.

2177
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:21,039
- How serious?
- It's under 25.

2178
02:06:21,074 --> 02:06:24,209
- It's under 25,000?
- Yeah.

2179
02:06:24,259 --> 02:06:27,049
- The rest of the two million is still there?
- Yeah, I got the rest.

2180
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:30,258
Okay, no big deal. That's okay.

2181
02:06:30,348 --> 02:06:32,428
He got his 25.

2182
02:06:32,508 --> 02:06:34,518
That I'll live with. Any more, I couldn't.

2183
02:06:34,558 --> 02:06:36,727
Okay.

2184
02:06:36,807 --> 02:06:40,147
All right, all right. Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.

2185
02:06:43,727 --> 02:06:45,607
Hi, Sam.

2186
02:06:55,656 --> 02:06:58,575
So what'd you do with it?

2187
02:06:58,615 --> 02:07:00,745
With what?

2188
02:07:00,785 --> 02:07:03,125
With the money.

2189
02:07:03,205 --> 02:07:07,544
He needed some clothes.

2190
02:07:07,584 --> 02:07:10,583
25,000 for clothes?

2191
02:07:10,633 --> 02:07:14,253
He wanted a watch too.

2192
02:07:15,803 --> 02:07:19,133
- 25,000 for clothes and a watch?
- Mm-hmm.

2193
02:07:19,223 --> 02:07:21,392
Mm-hmm.

2194
02:07:21,432 --> 02:07:23,812
- Good evening, signora. This way.
- Geno.

2195
02:07:23,852 --> 02:07:26,101
The good part was I had Amy back.

2196
02:07:26,141 --> 02:07:30,651
So we went home, had the housekeeper
stay over, put the kid to bed.

2197
02:07:30,691 --> 02:07:33,440
I calmed myself down,
and we went to dinner.

2198
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,650
I tried to keep things nice and civil...

2199
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:40,280
but, hey, 25,000 for three suits?

2200
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:42,620
That doesn't make much sense.

2201
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:46,329
First of all, he's not gonna wear
thousand-dollar suits.

2202
02:07:46,369 --> 02:07:48,619
Let's say he did, which he won't.

2203
02:07:48,659 --> 02:07:52,129
How you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

2204
02:07:52,169 --> 02:07:55,878
- # I'm confessin' #
- I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?

2205
02:07:55,998 --> 02:07:58,298
I can't get fitted that fast,
and I pay twice as much.

2206
02:07:58,378 --> 02:08:01,048
- I bought him a watch too.
- Yeah.

2207
02:08:01,128 --> 02:08:06,346
But even if you bought him a really nice
watch, one that he thought was nice...

2208
02:08:06,426 --> 02:08:08,806
He doesn't know
what the fuck a good watch is.

2209
02:08:08,846 --> 02:08:10,936
- Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...
- Yeah.

2210
02:08:10,976 --> 02:08:14,226
At the most, which is impossible, for him.

2211
02:08:14,306 --> 02:08:19,065
Plus, at the most, three suits,
1,000 apiece. That still leaves what?

2212
02:08:19,145 --> 02:08:22,604
- Around 10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?

2213
02:08:22,694 --> 02:08:26,734
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.

2214
02:08:27,824 --> 02:08:31,113
I'm home. We're working it out.

2215
02:08:31,203 --> 02:08:34,283
I've been told before,
"We're working it out."

2216
02:08:34,374 --> 02:08:36,284
You think that you're home...

2217
02:08:36,374 --> 02:08:40,752
after what you just put me
through with Amy, is a favor to me?

2218
02:08:47,052 --> 02:08:50,722
So, counting the watch,
let's say another 4,000...

2219
02:08:50,802 --> 02:08:53,011
for expenses over the weekend...

2220
02:08:53,051 --> 02:08:55,891
of which you must have had a good time.

2221
02:08:55,971 --> 02:08:57,891
I know he did. That's for sure.

2222
02:08:57,931 --> 02:09:01,810
I know that fuckin' piece
of shit had a good fuckin' time.

2223
02:09:03,269 --> 02:09:05,859
On my money.

2224
02:09:05,939 --> 02:09:10,439
You might as well have fucked him,
which you probably did anyway.

2225
02:09:10,529 --> 02:09:12,649
You're lookin' at me a certain way.

2226
02:09:12,699 --> 02:09:16,068
You're teary-eyed, huh?

2227
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:19,077
You're upset. You're
a good actress, you know that?

2228
02:09:19,157 --> 02:09:21,367
Good fuckin' actress.

2229
02:09:22,787 --> 02:09:24,918
You can fuckin' get
that pity out of people.

2230
02:09:24,998 --> 02:09:26,917
I'm not a john. You understand?

2231
02:09:26,997 --> 02:09:30,507
You always thought I was,
but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.

2232
02:09:30,547 --> 02:09:34,427
That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.

2233
02:09:34,507 --> 02:09:36,426
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.

2234
02:09:36,546 --> 02:09:39,805
Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.
If you would have stayed with Amy...

2235
02:09:39,885 --> 02:09:41,865
and you would have ran away,
he would have been fuckin' dead.

2236
02:09:41,885 --> 02:09:45,595
Both of you. Dead. Dead.

2237
02:09:45,685 --> 02:09:51,224
# Dreamin' dreams of you Little babe ##

2238
02:09:53,694 --> 02:09:56,563
No, it isn't right. It isn't fair.

2239
02:09:59,273 --> 02:10:01,692
Yes.

2240
02:10:01,732 --> 02:10:04,702
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fuckin' deal?

2241
02:10:04,742 --> 02:10:07,377
I go... Listen, I just
can't fuckin' take it.

2242
02:10:07,412 --> 02:10:11,082
Why should I fuckin' take it?
That wasn't the deal.

2243
02:10:11,122 --> 02:10:14,541
He acts like I'm the only one
around here with a fuckin' past.

2244
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:16,541
He'll never let me live it down.

2245
02:10:16,621 --> 02:10:19,921
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.

2246
02:10:19,961 --> 02:10:22,920
What the fuck do you think
I came back here for?

2247
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,760
No, I'm not. I want to have him killed.

2248
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:27,800
Yes, I want him killed.
I've fuckin' had it.

2249
02:10:27,890 --> 02:10:31,600
So are you with me on this?

2250
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:34,888
You want to get rid of me? Here I am.

2251
02:10:34,928 --> 02:10:36,898
Go ahead. Get rid of me.

2252
02:10:36,938 --> 02:10:40,728
- Hello.
- Yes, I do!

2253
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:45,567
I fuckin' hate you!
I can't take it anymore!

2254
02:10:45,607 --> 02:10:49,487
- Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
- You hate my guts?

2255
02:10:49,567 --> 02:10:51,926
- I'm sick of being with you!
- I want you to come with me now!

2256
02:10:51,946 --> 02:10:55,206
Come with me now. Come with me now.

2257
02:10:55,286 --> 02:10:58,205
I want you out. I want you out of here.

2258
02:10:58,285 --> 02:11:01,995
- I want you out of here!
I want you out of here!

2259
02:11:03,205 --> 02:11:05,506
Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here!

2260
02:11:05,586 --> 02:11:07,796
I'll go, but I want my money right now!

2261
02:11:07,836 --> 02:11:11,344
- You'll get your money! Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.

2262
02:11:11,424 --> 02:11:14,134
- No kidding!
- And I still get my money.

2263
02:11:14,264 --> 02:11:17,264
I need some cash right now!
You can't just put me in the street!

2264
02:11:17,344 --> 02:11:19,324
You haven't been straight
with me ever since I met you!

2265
02:11:19,344 --> 02:11:21,263
You never even loved me in the first place!

2266
02:11:21,353 --> 02:11:23,893
I need eyes in the back
of my head with you, you fuckin' bitch!

2267
02:11:24,023 --> 02:11:28,442
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!

2268
02:11:28,522 --> 02:11:31,561
- You're lower than a dog!
- Fuck you!

2269
02:11:31,611 --> 02:11:33,901
Here! Here! Is this enough money?

2270
02:11:33,981 --> 02:11:36,401
Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it!

2271
02:11:36,441 --> 02:11:39,741
- Greedy bitch. Take the fuckin' money.
- I'm going to the bank...

2272
02:11:39,821 --> 02:11:43,740
- and I'm getting my jewelry too!
- It opens at 9:00 a. m.

2273
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:46,370
Don't send your guys down there
to stop me! I mean it!

2274
02:11:46,499 --> 02:11:48,749
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.

2275
02:11:48,829 --> 02:11:50,809
You're not getting rid of me
with one fucking suitcase!

2276
02:11:50,829 --> 02:11:54,049
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here. Fine!

2277
02:11:54,129 --> 02:11:56,049
- I'm taking Amy.
- You're not taking Amy.

2278
02:11:56,129 --> 02:11:58,049
I am. I'm waking her up right now.

2279
02:11:58,169 --> 02:12:00,049
You're stoned. You're a junkie.
Get out of here.

2280
02:12:00,179 --> 02:12:02,159
- I am not! She's my daughter too!
- Get out of here!

2281
02:12:02,179 --> 02:12:04,889
Send my lawyers a letter,
god-fuckin'- damn you!

2282
02:12:05,008 --> 02:12:09,727
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cheat me out of my end!

2283
02:12:09,767 --> 02:12:12,107
Fucker!

2284
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:07,940
The funny thing was,
after all that, I didn't want her to go.

2285
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:10,780
She was the mother of my kid. I loved her.

2286
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:14,119
And later, I realized I didn't want
to give her the money...

2287
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:19,449
because if I did,
I knew I'd never see her again.

2288
02:13:29,507 --> 02:13:32,968
- Oh. Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.

2289
02:13:33,048 --> 02:13:35,008
Okay, angel.

2290
02:13:39,386 --> 02:13:43,476
From now on, I have to know
where you and Amy are at all times.

2291
02:13:45,226 --> 02:13:47,515
Here's a beeper.

2292
02:13:47,605 --> 02:13:49,725
I want you to keep it on you.

2293
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:51,775
It's very light.

2294
02:13:51,855 --> 02:13:54,105
So I can call you whenever I have to.

2295
02:13:56,695 --> 02:13:58,823
Okay?

2296
02:14:09,703 --> 02:14:11,392
What are you supposed to do?
What do you want to do?

2297
02:14:11,412 --> 02:14:14,332
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.

2298
02:14:14,372 --> 02:14:17,671
Listen, two people don't get along,
at some point you gotta call it.

2299
02:14:17,751 --> 02:14:20,341
It's none of my business,
but I think that's what you gotta do.

2300
02:14:20,421 --> 02:14:22,471
You're right. I know.

2301
02:14:22,551 --> 02:14:26,301
- I was just...
- What? What?

2302
02:14:26,391 --> 02:14:28,351
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?

2303
02:14:28,431 --> 02:14:30,681
- I don't...
- Tell me what you were gonna say.

2304
02:14:30,771 --> 02:14:32,681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2305
02:14:32,770 --> 02:14:36,189
I was thinking maybe
you know somebody at the bank...

2306
02:14:36,269 --> 02:14:39,019
who could help me get my jewelry out?

2307
02:14:39,109 --> 02:14:41,189
There's a lot of money in there.

2308
02:14:41,319 --> 02:14:44,568
I'd be willing to take care
of anybody who helped me out.

2309
02:14:45,948 --> 02:14:48,868
- Let me think about that.
- Okay.

2310
02:14:48,948 --> 02:14:52,828
Let me see who I got. Gotta get
somebody I can trust, you know?

2311
02:14:52,948 --> 02:14:56,036
- You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
- Hmm.

2312
02:14:56,076 --> 02:14:59,666
He holds that key so tight,
he's probably got it stuck up his ass.

2313
02:14:59,746 --> 02:15:03,466
You're right. That's Sammy.

2314
02:15:03,586 --> 02:15:05,756
And he's probably got it there too.

2315
02:15:07,925 --> 02:15:11,506
He's so fuckin' lucky.
I could have buried him.

2316
02:15:11,636 --> 02:15:16,055
I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby.

2317
02:15:16,135 --> 02:15:20,394
- Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
- No, he wouldn't.

2318
02:15:20,474 --> 02:15:22,434
I would have.

2319
02:15:22,474 --> 02:15:24,644
- He'd have been right too. Seriously.
- Come on.

2320
02:15:24,774 --> 02:15:28,154
- You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
- I didn't.

2321
02:15:28,194 --> 02:15:31,822
I mean, I did, but then I did exactly
what you told me to do, and I came back.

2322
02:15:31,942 --> 02:15:35,702
- You did. You're right. You did. I like that.
- Exactly what you said.

2323
02:15:35,782 --> 02:15:39,282
- That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
- I did what you told me.

2324
02:15:39,372 --> 02:15:42,701
- Yes, you did.
- Because you always tell me the right thing to do.

2325
02:15:42,831 --> 02:15:44,791
Yeah.

2326
02:15:44,911 --> 02:15:49,001
# And now that it's all over ##

2327
02:15:49,131 --> 02:15:53,249
He really fucked himself up
out here, didn't he?

2328
02:15:53,299 --> 02:15:55,759
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.

2329
02:15:57,719 --> 02:15:59,639
- Changed.
- Changed.

2330
02:15:59,719 --> 02:16:03,640
- He did. He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.

2331
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:07,479
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.

2332
02:16:10,398 --> 02:16:12,358
He hates me.

2333
02:16:12,478 --> 02:16:14,438
He hates my fuckin' guts.

2334
02:16:14,568 --> 02:16:18,317
Come on, come on.
You're a toughie. You can take this.

2335
02:16:22,117 --> 02:16:25,327
- Don't cry.
- I'm not as tough as you think I am.

2336
02:16:25,407 --> 02:16:27,285
Yes, you are.

2337
02:16:27,405 --> 02:16:29,455
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.

2338
02:16:29,575 --> 02:16:32,995
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.

2339
02:16:33,085 --> 02:16:37,795
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help. I do.

2340
02:16:37,914 --> 02:16:41,844
I need some help.

2341
02:16:41,884 --> 02:16:43,844
You gotta help me.

2342
02:16:43,924 --> 02:16:46,843
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

2343
02:16:46,923 --> 02:16:48,973
I do. I need a new sponsor.

2344
02:16:49,053 --> 02:16:50,933
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.

2345
02:16:51,013 --> 02:16:54,313
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.

2346
02:16:54,393 --> 02:16:58,313
Okay. Don't worry about it.

2347
02:16:58,353 --> 02:17:00,852
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.

2348
02:17:00,902 --> 02:17:02,882
- I'll take care of you. Yes, I will.
- Take care of me.

2349
02:17:02,902 --> 02:17:05,651
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Thank you. Yeah.

2350
02:17:05,691 --> 02:17:08,531
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- It's what you want?

2351
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:24,128
# Yes, it came from your pen, dear,
but not from your heart #

2352
02:17:24,208 --> 02:17:26,838
# The third king The joke of the deck #

2353
02:17:26,878 --> 02:17:29,588
# You ended your letter enclosed
"Please sign my check" #

2354
02:17:29,668 --> 02:17:32,508
- That's Ace's wife.
- # Why, you fool #

2355
02:17:32,588 --> 02:17:36,507
- # You poor, sad, worthless foolish fool #
- Fantastic.

2356
02:17:36,557 --> 02:17:40,688
# If you think that money can pay
for the hard years I've suffered #

2357
02:17:40,728 --> 02:17:42,727
# 'Til things broke your way #

2358
02:17:42,767 --> 02:17:47,526
- This is great for the boss.
- # I'm answering your last letter that says we must part #

2359
02:17:47,566 --> 02:17:51,446
# I'm tearing up the pieces
the way you tore up my heart #

2360
02:17:51,526 --> 02:17:55,986
# I smile when you kiss me
and I thrill at your touch #

2361
02:17:56,076 --> 02:18:00,614
# My only sin was
I loved you much too much #

2362
02:18:00,704 --> 02:18:03,284
# Win a little #

2363
02:18:03,414 --> 02:18:06,124
# Lose a little ##

2364
02:18:14,043 --> 02:18:16,963
- Hi.
- Hi.

2365
02:18:18,882 --> 02:18:21,551
- You didn't answer your beeper.
- I threw it away.

2366
02:18:21,591 --> 02:18:24,301
You threw it away?

2367
02:18:24,391 --> 02:18:26,701
I tried to do this thing. I know that
you want me to, but it's just...

2368
02:18:26,721 --> 02:18:29,451
I'm driving down the freeway and the
fuckin' thing's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

2369
02:18:29,471 --> 02:18:32,141
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.

2370
02:18:32,231 --> 02:18:35,651
I don't want to do it anymore. Where's Amy?

2371
02:18:35,731 --> 02:18:38,150
- I put her to bed.
- Oh.

2372
02:18:38,190 --> 02:18:40,150
I got your cigarettes.

2373
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:44,859
Oscar wants you to call him.

2374
02:18:46,069 --> 02:18:48,869
- So who'd you go to lunch with?
- Jennifer.

2375
02:18:48,909 --> 02:18:51,659
- Where'd you go?
- To the Riviera.

2376
02:18:53,209 --> 02:18:55,958
What'd you have?

2377
02:18:55,998 --> 02:19:00,337
- I had a salad.
- What did Jennifer have?

2378
02:19:00,377 --> 02:19:02,627
She had the same.

2379
02:19:02,717 --> 02:19:05,637
Okay.

2380
02:19:05,676 --> 02:19:07,846
I want you to call Jennifer...

2381
02:19:07,886 --> 02:19:11,176
and I want you to tell her
to tell you what you had for lunch.

2382
02:19:11,216 --> 02:19:14,016
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.

2383
02:19:14,096 --> 02:19:17,684
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why.

2384
02:19:17,724 --> 02:19:20,685
- Just do it.
- Fine.

2385
02:19:20,725 --> 02:19:23,695
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.

2386
02:19:31,234 --> 02:19:33,154
The line's busy.

2387
02:19:33,244 --> 02:19:35,203
There's nobody there.

2388
02:19:41,582 --> 02:19:44,412
- Hello.
- Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.

2389
02:19:46,542 --> 02:19:51,671
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.

2390
02:19:51,801 --> 02:19:53,720
Okay.

2391
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:59,350
Who were you with?

2392
02:19:59,430 --> 02:20:01,810
I was with somebody.

2393
02:20:01,890 --> 02:20:06,229
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?

2394
02:20:13,069 --> 02:20:16,988
I just hope it's not someone
who I think it might be.

2395
02:20:18,568 --> 02:20:21,828
I just hope it's not that.

2396
02:20:24,408 --> 02:20:26,917
I knew she fucked around.

2397
02:20:26,957 --> 02:20:29,077
She did what she did,
and I did what I had to do...

2398
02:20:29,127 --> 02:20:34,336
but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing
she could have done.

2399
02:20:34,416 --> 02:20:36,925
What if he won't stop?

2400
02:20:36,965 --> 02:20:39,005
It could get us both killed.

2401
02:20:39,085 --> 02:20:42,095
I can back him off.

2402
02:20:43,765 --> 02:20:48,015
She was
very convincing when she wanted to be.

2403
02:20:48,094 --> 02:20:50,053
And this is how she backed him off.

2404
02:20:56,853 --> 02:20:59,064
Hey, Ginger.

2405
02:20:59,194 --> 02:21:01,613
Don't forget, if you're challenged...

2406
02:21:01,693 --> 02:21:04,613
if he asks anything, deny everything.

2407
02:21:04,653 --> 02:21:07,452
You understand? I don't want him
bringing beefs back home.

2408
02:21:07,532 --> 02:21:10,781
That could really cause a serious problem.

2409
02:21:10,821 --> 02:21:12,741
Got to be careful. He's not dumb, you know?

2410
02:21:12,831 --> 02:21:14,791
You hear what I'm saying, right?

2411
02:21:14,871 --> 02:21:16,961
I know. You don't have to tell me that.

2412
02:21:17,041 --> 02:21:19,791
What? Do you think I'm stupid?

2413
02:21:19,871 --> 02:21:22,130
Do I think you're stupid? No.

2414
02:21:22,210 --> 02:21:25,050
I think you're beautiful. But I gotta go.

2415
02:21:28,629 --> 02:21:30,699
By this time, Nicky had things
so fucked up on the streets...

2416
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:35,468
that every time Marino went back home,
the packages got smaller and smaller.

2417
02:21:37,888 --> 02:21:39,978
It got to the point,
when he walked into the place...

2418
02:21:40,058 --> 02:21:42,808
he didn't know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed.

2419
02:21:42,898 --> 02:21:45,726
Frankie, I want to ask you something.

2420
02:21:45,816 --> 02:21:47,736
It's private.

2421
02:21:47,816 --> 02:21:49,737
But I want you to tell me the truth.

2422
02:21:49,817 --> 02:21:51,947
Of course, Remo.

2423
02:21:51,987 --> 02:21:55,487
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.

2424
02:21:55,577 --> 02:21:58,656
I always tell you the truth, Remo.

2425
02:21:58,746 --> 02:22:01,996
Frankie... the little guy...

2426
02:22:02,076 --> 02:22:04,165
he wouldn't be fucking
the Jew's wife, would he?

2427
02:22:04,245 --> 02:22:07,914
Because if he is, it's a problem.

2428
02:22:10,084 --> 02:22:12,004
What could I say?

2429
02:22:12,084 --> 02:22:14,004
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...

2430
02:22:14,094 --> 02:22:18,674
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them
could have wound up gettin' killed.

2431
02:22:18,724 --> 02:22:21,013
Because there's one thing
about these old-timers.

2432
02:22:21,093 --> 02:22:24,012
They don't like any fucking around
with the other guys' wives.

2433
02:22:24,052 --> 02:22:26,062
It's bad for business.

2434
02:22:26,102 --> 02:22:29,352
So I lied, even though I knew
that by lying to Gaggi...

2435
02:22:29,432 --> 02:22:32,191
I could wind up gettin' killed too.

2436
02:22:32,271 --> 02:22:36,901
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?

2437
02:22:36,941 --> 02:22:39,692
I'm positive.

2438
02:22:39,822 --> 02:22:43,870
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.

2439
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:46,030
I know. That's why I'm asking.

2440
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,870
- You see, my main concern is Nicky.
- Mm-hmm.

2441
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:52,870
I want to know if he's
doing all right, if he's okay.

2442
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:58,379
- He's good. He's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.

2443
02:22:58,419 --> 02:23:01,338
- Do it for me.
- No problem.

2444
02:23:01,378 --> 02:23:07,217
I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing
anything for our friends. Understand?

2445
02:23:07,307 --> 02:23:09,887
- I understand.
- Okay.

2446
02:23:09,967 --> 02:23:12,517
Frankie, you're a good boy.

2447
02:23:12,557 --> 02:23:14,517
Thanks, Remo.

2448
02:23:14,557 --> 02:23:17,516
By now, Nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom.

2449
02:23:17,566 --> 02:23:20,185
Vegas really got to him.

2450
02:23:20,235 --> 02:23:24,025
The booze, the coke, the broads.

2451
02:23:24,065 --> 02:23:26,365
I mean, he got sloppy.

2452
02:23:26,405 --> 02:23:28,365
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.

2453
02:23:28,405 --> 02:23:31,535
- You must have drank too much.
- Go fuck yourself.

2454
02:23:31,615 --> 02:23:33,575
One night he had
to belt a guy three times...

2455
02:23:33,615 --> 02:23:35,540
before the guy finally went down.

2456
02:23:35,575 --> 02:23:37,914
In the old days, Nicky would have
decked him with one shot.

2457
02:23:37,994 --> 02:23:40,333
You add this into the mix...

2458
02:23:40,413 --> 02:23:43,253
Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.

2459
02:23:43,293 --> 02:23:45,543
His crew followed him right over the edge.

2460
02:23:45,583 --> 02:23:48,463
They were all tuned up
half the time on coke.

2461
02:23:48,553 --> 02:23:51,512
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.

2462
02:23:51,592 --> 02:23:54,682
- Hey, what do you guys want?
- Police! Stay in the car!

2463
02:23:54,762 --> 02:23:57,101
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.

2464
02:23:57,141 --> 02:23:59,351
- Drop the gun!
- Fuck you!

2465
02:24:03,980 --> 02:24:06,650
The cops shot Blue...

2466
02:24:06,730 --> 02:24:10,785
because they thought
his hero sandwich was a gun.

2467
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:13,180
- They could have been right, but who knows?
- Jesus Christ!

2468
02:24:13,239 --> 02:24:15,988
What gun? He's got
a fuckin' hero sandwich here.

2469
02:24:16,068 --> 02:24:18,159
- What do you want? It's pitch black.
- Pitch black!

2470
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:21,619
- It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun!
- You fuckin' moron!

2471
02:24:21,699 --> 02:24:24,638
- I'll be fillin' out paperwork for the next two months!
- What are we gonna do?

2472
02:24:24,658 --> 02:24:26,118
- I'm sorry!
- You jerk-off!

2473
02:24:26,248 --> 02:24:29,168
To get even,
Nicky's crew got stoned one night...

2474
02:24:29,248 --> 02:24:31,168
and they started shooting up
the cops' houses.

2475
02:24:43,016 --> 02:24:45,886
It got to the point where they couldn't
talk in the Gold Rush anymore...

2476
02:24:45,976 --> 02:24:48,015
because the Feds put a wire in the wall.

2477
02:24:48,055 --> 02:24:50,685
Even when they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths...

2478
02:24:50,725 --> 02:24:53,334
- Shit, he's covering up again.
- Because the Feds brought in lip readers.

2479
02:24:53,354 --> 02:24:56,984
Nicky found out from a teller
who owed him money.

2480
02:24:57,024 --> 02:24:59,983
He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

2481
02:25:00,023 --> 02:25:03,153
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

2482
02:25:03,193 --> 02:25:06,203
He asked me again about you
and the Jew's wife.

2483
02:25:06,243 --> 02:25:08,374
Yeah? What'd you tell him?

2484
02:25:08,414 --> 02:25:10,492
I told him I didn't know nothin'.

2485
02:25:10,532 --> 02:25:14,832
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said
if you did anything, you're fucked up.

2486
02:25:14,872 --> 02:25:18,672
You think he's going home
making a beef behind my back?

2487
02:25:18,712 --> 02:25:21,211
Nah, you would have heard something.

2488
02:25:21,251 --> 02:25:26,671
- What's to stop him?
- I know, I know.

2489
02:25:26,761 --> 02:25:30,720
I don't trust him anymore,
but they'd never okay anything.

2490
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:33,349
Yeah, but they keep asking about it.

2491
02:25:33,389 --> 02:25:37,349
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.

2492
02:25:37,389 --> 02:25:42,019
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start
a fuckin' war or something.

2493
02:25:42,069 --> 02:25:46,188
I'm not sure yet,
but you know what I want you to do?

2494
02:25:46,278 --> 02:25:48,857
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

2495
02:25:48,907 --> 02:25:50,947
That ain't nobody.

2496
02:25:51,027 --> 02:25:53,157
You know what I want you to do?

2497
02:25:53,237 --> 02:25:57,457
Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the
desert, then let them show you where it's at.

2498
02:25:57,537 --> 02:26:00,997
- Angelo and Buster.
- Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

2499
02:26:01,077 --> 02:26:03,997
- They'll do it.
- When I'm ready, I'll say the word.

2500
02:26:04,087 --> 02:26:07,835
- Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.
- Yeah.

2501
02:26:07,915 --> 02:26:09,835
Just let me know. But you got to be ready.

2502
02:26:09,925 --> 02:26:12,465
You know what I'm talkin' about?

2503
02:26:12,595 --> 02:26:14,465
Did I say to do anything yet?

2504
02:26:14,595 --> 02:26:17,844
I said I'm not sure. I'll let
you know. I want to think about it.

2505
02:26:17,924 --> 02:26:20,684
Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they're in the motel?

2506
02:26:20,764 --> 02:26:24,893
There or in the fuckin' bank.
I don't know. All over the joint.

2507
02:26:24,973 --> 02:26:29,522
# Hey, hey, hey That's what I say #

2508
02:26:29,602 --> 02:26:31,982
# I can't get no #

2509
02:26:32,062 --> 02:26:34,652
# Satisfaction #

2510
02:26:34,732 --> 02:26:37,032
# I can't get me no #

2511
02:26:37,112 --> 02:26:39,362
# I can't get no #

2512
02:26:39,452 --> 02:26:44,080
# And I try and I try
And I try, try, try, try #

2513
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:48,501
# I can't get no I can't get me no #

2514
02:26:48,581 --> 02:26:51,021
- # When I'm watchin' my TV #
- Be right back. I'll be right back.

2515
02:26:51,041 --> 02:26:53,630
# And a man comes on to tell me # - Rudy.

2516
02:26:53,710 --> 02:26:55,860
Any calls for me, just give them
to Mr. Sherbert. I'll be right back.

2517
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:58,630
- Sure, Mr. Rothstein.
- I'm going home for a few seconds.

2518
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:00,630
# Same cigarettes as me #

2519
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:04,798
# I can't get no No, no, no #

2520
02:27:04,888 --> 02:27:06,928
# Hey, hey, hey #

2521
02:27:07,018 --> 02:27:10,848
- # That's what I say #
- He's on his way home.

2522
02:27:10,938 --> 02:27:14,648
- Oh... okay.
- # And I'm doing this And I'm trying that #

2523
02:27:14,727 --> 02:27:16,937
# And I'm trying to make some dough #

2524
02:27:17,067 --> 02:27:19,317
# Baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby #

2525
02:27:19,397 --> 02:27:21,997
# Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
baby, baby, baby, baby # - Hello?

2526
02:27:22,066 --> 02:27:25,486
# Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby,
baby, baby, baby ## - Hello? Ginger?

2527
02:27:25,526 --> 02:27:28,075
- Help, Daddy!
- Amy!

2528
02:27:28,155 --> 02:27:31,825
- Amy, open the door!
- I can't! I'm tied!

2529
02:27:36,035 --> 02:27:37,995
- Dad!
- What happened?

2530
02:27:38,085 --> 02:27:40,294
- Who did this to you?
- Mommy.

2531
02:27:40,374 --> 02:27:42,674
I'm gonna get a knife
and cut you loose, honey.

2532
02:27:42,754 --> 02:27:45,794
- No, please, please!
- Okay, Papa will be right back.

2533
02:27:45,844 --> 02:27:48,843
- When did this happen, honey?
- I don't know.

2534
02:27:48,923 --> 02:27:51,633
What time did your mother
do this? When did she leave?

2535
02:27:51,683 --> 02:27:53,643
I don't know.

2536
02:28:01,021 --> 02:28:02,891
- Hello?
- Sammy.

2537
02:28:03,021 --> 02:28:04,941
- Yeah. Who's this? Nick?
- Me.

2538
02:28:05,021 --> 02:28:07,321
- Yeah. You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

2539
02:28:07,361 --> 02:28:10,651
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.

2540
02:28:10,691 --> 02:28:13,010
Ginger's missing. She tied Amy up
and locked her in her room.

2541
02:28:13,030 --> 02:28:14,950
I gotta find her.
I don't know where she is.

2542
02:28:15,030 --> 02:28:18,159
Well, listen, Ginger's here
at the Leaning Tower with me.

2543
02:28:18,199 --> 02:28:20,159
She's there with you? She's there with you?

2544
02:28:20,199 --> 02:28:22,539
- Yeah, she's here.
- I'll be right over.

2545
02:28:22,619 --> 02:28:26,289
Uh, all right.

2546
02:28:26,329 --> 02:28:30,339
- Comin' over.
- Great.

2547
02:28:34,258 --> 02:28:37,217
Ace, listen, don't make a scene, all right?

2548
02:28:37,297 --> 02:28:40,197
- I want to just talk to that Irish bitch.
- She didn't know who to turn to.

2549
02:28:40,217 --> 02:28:42,207
She didn't know where to turn.
She's trying to save your marriage.

2550
02:28:42,227 --> 02:28:45,347
- Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
- Hey.

2551
02:28:45,397 --> 02:28:48,186
Be fuckin' nice. Calm.

2552
02:28:48,226 --> 02:28:53,856
Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.

2553
02:28:59,774 --> 02:29:02,324
# I'll throw off my sorrow ##

2554
02:29:02,404 --> 02:29:04,864
- Hi, Sam.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

2555
02:29:04,954 --> 02:29:08,993
You tie up our kid and lock the
fucking door? Are you out of your mind?

2556
02:29:09,123 --> 02:29:11,203
That's our child.
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

2557
02:29:11,293 --> 02:29:14,412
It was just for a little while,
Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.

2558
02:29:14,542 --> 02:29:17,833
I ought to fuckin' have you committed.
You fuckin' do that again, I'll...

2559
02:29:17,963 --> 02:29:20,483
- I was just gonna be out for a little while.
- I should have...

2560
02:29:20,552 --> 02:29:24,092
- She was asleep. I was gonna be right back...
- Listen.

2561
02:29:24,222 --> 02:29:26,742
- Before she even woke up.
- Listen, you fuckin' cunt. Listen to me.

2562
02:29:26,762 --> 02:29:28,742
- Fuck you. I was gonna be back...
- Let me tell you something.

2563
02:29:28,762 --> 02:29:31,261
- Before she woke up.
- Listen to me. Listen carefully.

2564
02:29:31,351 --> 02:29:33,580
You ever touch her again, you ever
do anything like that again...

2565
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:35,560
I'll fuckin' kill ya, pure and simple.

2566
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:37,560
You hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple.

2567
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:39,790
- Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
- I'll fuckin' kill you.

2568
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:42,819
- You fuckin' whore.
- I'll sign anything you want me to sign.

2569
02:29:42,899 --> 02:29:45,569
I just want the key to my jewelry,
and I want you to let me go.

2570
02:29:45,649 --> 02:29:47,639
- You want your jewelry?
- I want you to let me go.

2571
02:29:47,659 --> 02:29:49,569
And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig?

2572
02:29:49,659 --> 02:29:51,658
Let you disgrace me?
Get up and be a mother.

2573
02:29:51,788 --> 02:29:54,037
Get in the car and go
to the house right now.

2574
02:29:54,157 --> 02:29:58,037
Get up and get in the...
Get... Get up. Get up!

2575
02:29:58,167 --> 02:30:00,997
- Get up. Get up.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

2576
02:30:01,127 --> 02:30:02,747
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get up!

2577
02:30:02,837 --> 02:30:04,897
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get the fuck... Are you threatening me?

2578
02:30:04,917 --> 02:30:07,837
I'll fuckin' kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.

2579
02:30:07,967 --> 02:30:09,796
- I'm going! I'm going!
- You...

2580
02:30:16,096 --> 02:30:19,015
- Now you need approval from him to go home?
- So what?

2581
02:30:19,095 --> 02:30:21,765
So who fuckin' blew you
in the parking lot before you came in?

2582
02:30:21,855 --> 02:30:24,025
- Huh?
- You make me sick, you fuckin'...

2583
02:30:24,145 --> 02:30:26,525
- Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
- Oh, fuck you!

2584
02:30:26,645 --> 02:30:31,773
- Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! Fuck you!
- # I can't get no satisfaction #

2585
02:30:31,863 --> 02:30:33,823
# I can't get me no satisfaction #

2586
02:30:33,903 --> 02:30:36,193
# I can't get no satisfaction #

2587
02:30:36,323 --> 02:30:39,572
- # I can't get me no satisfaction #
- Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please.

2588
02:30:39,702 --> 02:30:41,662
- Who's this?
- Billy, listen, I'll explain later.

2589
02:30:41,782 --> 02:30:44,542
- You got a gun at home? Bring it over right away.
- Yeah.

2590
02:30:44,662 --> 02:30:46,911
- Take it easy. I'll do it.
- Okay.

2591
02:30:47,081 --> 02:30:49,711
# No-no-no-no-no satisfaction #

2592
02:30:49,791 --> 02:30:52,610
# No-no-no-no, I can't get me no
satisfaction # - Leave it where it is!

2593
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:55,551
# I can't get no satisfaction ##

2594
02:30:55,631 --> 02:30:57,921
Where is he? Goddamn it,
I want that Jew bastard killed!

2595
02:30:58,051 --> 02:30:59,931
Calm down. Shh. Hide her car in the back.

2596
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:04,350
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!

2597
02:31:04,390 --> 02:31:07,209
What did I tell you? Supposin' he goes
back home and makes a fuckin' beef?

2598
02:31:07,229 --> 02:31:10,809
- I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said.
- Me? I said nothing.

2599
02:31:10,899 --> 02:31:14,818
I said, "No, no, no." Everything
he said, I just kept saying no.

2600
02:31:14,898 --> 02:31:16,778
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous.

2601
02:31:16,898 --> 02:31:20,818
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous
situation. Be very careful."

2602
02:31:20,908 --> 02:31:23,448
If it's so fucking dangerous,
then why don't you kill him?

2603
02:31:23,527 --> 02:31:25,906
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up.

2604
02:31:25,946 --> 02:31:29,706
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a smart-ass!

2605
02:31:29,786 --> 02:31:33,376
I know the guy 35 years,
I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?

2606
02:31:33,416 --> 02:31:37,005
Motherfucker.

2607
02:31:37,085 --> 02:31:41,465
- I knew this. I knew it.
- What about my money?

2608
02:31:41,545 --> 02:31:43,924
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?

2609
02:31:44,044 --> 02:31:46,615
You think he's gonna give you
fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?

2610
02:31:46,635 --> 02:31:48,515
- Look what you did to this fuckin' guy?
- What?

2611
02:31:48,634 --> 02:31:50,974
If you would have just
kept your fuckin' mouth shut.

2612
02:31:51,054 --> 02:31:53,554
What the fuck is the use! I should've
never got involved...

2613
02:31:53,604 --> 02:31:58,894
Hey! Hey! You motherfucker, you!

2614
02:31:58,934 --> 02:32:03,102
Ow! You fuck! You fucker!
Get out! Get the fuck out!

2615
02:32:03,152 --> 02:32:06,652
Get out! Get the fuck out!

2616
02:32:06,782 --> 02:32:08,902
- No! No!
- Get down there! Take it easy!

2617
02:32:09,072 --> 02:32:11,571
I should never have gotten involved
with this fucking nut!

2618
02:32:11,701 --> 02:32:13,951
You'll fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.

2619
02:32:13,991 --> 02:32:16,581
Get her out of here. Get her out of here.

2620
02:32:16,621 --> 02:32:18,871
Let's go. Let's go.

2621
02:32:22,289 --> 02:32:26,499
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!

2622
02:32:26,629 --> 02:32:30,419
- All right.
- I'm going to the F.B.I.! I'm not scared anymore!

2623
02:32:30,469 --> 02:32:34,049
- All right. Be careful.
- You've fucked with me for the last time!

2624
02:32:34,139 --> 02:32:36,849
Okay. Yeah.

2625
02:32:36,929 --> 02:32:40,598
Be careful. Come on. Get inside.

2626
02:32:40,638 --> 02:32:45,397
- Can you believe that?
- Look at this motherfucker.

2627
02:32:45,477 --> 02:32:47,397
Whew.

2628
02:32:47,437 --> 02:32:51,437
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.

2629
02:32:51,487 --> 02:32:54,777
I should never have started
with this fuckin' broad.

2630
02:32:54,817 --> 02:32:57,275
Take it easy. What could you do?

2631
02:32:57,325 --> 02:33:00,285
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?

2632
02:33:02,825 --> 02:33:08,544
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here.
You know that?

2633
02:33:08,664 --> 02:33:13,214
A bad fuckin' spot.

2634
02:33:25,433 --> 02:33:27,433
I'd already left the kid with neighbors...

2635
02:33:27,513 --> 02:33:29,433
and I had about a million
in cash and jewels...

2636
02:33:29,513 --> 02:33:31,852
that I gave to Sherbert
to lock up in the hotel.

2637
02:33:31,932 --> 02:33:34,731
Put it in the hotel safe,
then I want you to come right back.

2638
02:34:07,427 --> 02:34:09,637
- She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's...

2639
02:34:09,677 --> 02:34:14,057
- Wait there for me.
Get out here and talk to me!

2640
02:34:14,097 --> 02:34:17,976
You fuckin' ignore me, you motherfucker!

2641
02:34:18,056 --> 02:34:22,646
I mean it! Come down here right now!

2642
02:34:22,726 --> 02:34:26,356
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it!

2643
02:34:26,396 --> 02:34:28,775
Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out here!

2644
02:34:28,865 --> 02:34:32,324
I'm going to drive your fucking
car through the living room!

2645
02:34:32,404 --> 02:34:37,784
You fucking coward! You motherfucker!

2646
02:34:37,864 --> 02:34:41,453
- Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
- Will you stop it?

2647
02:34:41,533 --> 02:34:43,623
- You're drunk. You're on drugs.
- I am not!

2648
02:34:43,703 --> 02:34:47,833
- You're going to be sorry if you don't stop it.
- Don't you threaten me!

2649
02:34:47,923 --> 02:34:51,631
You are not threatening me anymore!

2650
02:34:51,671 --> 02:34:55,551
You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you!

2651
02:34:55,591 --> 02:34:59,971
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
I am! He's my new sponsor!

2652
02:35:00,051 --> 02:35:02,640
How about that, you fuckhead!

2653
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:04,721
What are you looking at? Fuck off!

2654
02:35:04,811 --> 02:35:08,480
Hey. Go back inside!
This is none of your business!

2655
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:11,150
I don't have to take your shit
all the time anymore!

2656
02:35:11,190 --> 02:35:13,689
I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I will go to the police!

2657
02:35:13,779 --> 02:35:17,149
- I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!
- Mrs. Rothstein... Shh.

2658
02:35:17,199 --> 02:35:20,279
He won't let me inside!

2659
02:35:20,369 --> 02:35:25,118
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've been
getting some complaints about the noise.

2660
02:35:25,158 --> 02:35:27,957
- I'm trying to get in my house. He won't let me in.
- I understand.

2661
02:35:28,037 --> 02:35:30,357
I won't let her in. I'm sorry,
Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.

2662
02:35:30,377 --> 02:35:32,937
- I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving.
- Not gonna let me in?

2663
02:35:32,957 --> 02:35:35,146
- Who knows what you're gonna do in there.
- What am I gonna do?

2664
02:35:35,166 --> 02:35:37,126
I've been in the same clothes for two days!

2665
02:35:37,166 --> 02:35:39,546
- I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
- Okay.

2666
02:35:39,626 --> 02:35:42,466
How about if we just let her
in the house to get a few things?

2667
02:35:42,506 --> 02:35:44,696
- This is half her house anyway.
- I'm afraid to let her in the house.

2668
02:35:44,716 --> 02:35:46,824
You aren't afraid, you fucker!
- I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.

2669
02:35:46,844 --> 02:35:49,844
- Let me in the house!
- Hey, hey, hey!

2670
02:35:49,934 --> 02:35:52,224
Fucker! Fucker! Hold on! Hey! Please!

2671
02:35:52,304 --> 02:35:54,295
You ought to be afraid,
the way you fuckin' treat me!

2672
02:35:54,315 --> 02:35:57,894
- It'll make it easier...
- If we let her get her things...

2673
02:35:57,984 --> 02:36:01,004
- we'll be out of your hair.
- If she calms down, I will let her in the house...

2674
02:36:01,024 --> 02:36:04,943
- I am calm!
- If she calms down...

2675
02:36:05,033 --> 02:36:06,943
I will let her in the house
for five minutes...

2676
02:36:07,033 --> 02:36:11,072
if you gentlemen will escort her out
if she happens to not want to leave.

2677
02:36:11,202 --> 02:36:13,182
- Can I go in? Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.

2678
02:36:13,202 --> 02:36:16,452
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes. Yes. Fine! Fuck you!

2679
02:36:19,662 --> 02:36:23,110
You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to
me. He's locked up most of my important stuff.

2680
02:36:23,130 --> 02:36:25,610
All my papers and things... I have to
get them. So don't let him come up here.

2681
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:29,380
I know they're in here in the desk... Fuck.

2682
02:36:32,139 --> 02:36:35,179
Just pay attention.
He could come up here at any time.

2683
02:36:38,429 --> 02:36:40,639
Are you watching for him?

2684
02:36:42,349 --> 02:36:44,058
Got 'em.

2685
02:36:44,108 --> 02:36:47,228
I don't want her in there
more than a few more minutes.

2686
02:36:47,358 --> 02:36:50,528
No, it'll just be a couple...
We got other things to do too.

2687
02:36:53,738 --> 02:36:56,027
I'll hurry her up.

2688
02:36:56,157 --> 02:36:58,617
- How's everything else besides this?
- Fine. Fine.

2689
02:36:58,697 --> 02:37:02,866
- How's your family?
- Not bad. In fact, my wife's pregnant again.

2690
02:37:02,996 --> 02:37:06,705
- Oh, good. Congratulations.
- Thanks. Yeah.

2691
02:37:06,745 --> 02:37:08,705
We're kind of happy about that.

2692
02:37:08,835 --> 02:37:12,425
I just have to get this one more
thing and then we can go.

2693
02:37:12,465 --> 02:37:14,425
Shit! Fuck!

2694
02:37:14,465 --> 02:37:17,095
Shit! God!

2695
02:37:17,135 --> 02:37:20,133
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don't worry about it.

2696
02:37:20,223 --> 02:37:22,683
And it would be great...

2697
02:37:22,763 --> 02:37:24,683
if you guys could just
follow me out of here...

2698
02:37:24,763 --> 02:37:26,973
because he's been threatening me!

2699
02:37:27,063 --> 02:37:29,722
Take care. Thank you.

2700
02:37:48,241 --> 02:37:51,620
I can't believe this.

2701
02:38:01,459 --> 02:38:04,508
I just need to pick up a little cash
inside. Could you come with me?

2702
02:38:10,598 --> 02:38:14,766
- Charlie, you've got to stop her. You've got to stop her.
- I'm sorry, Sam.

2703
02:38:14,806 --> 02:38:17,936
- What can I do?
- She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind!

2704
02:38:17,976 --> 02:38:20,436
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.

2705
02:38:20,476 --> 02:38:22,987
- Oh!
- There's nothing I can do. I'd like to help...

2706
02:38:23,067 --> 02:38:25,107
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take that stuff.

2707
02:38:25,157 --> 02:38:27,846
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Half
of everything is mine. Ace, listen to me.

2708
02:38:27,866 --> 02:38:29,986
- There's nothing I can do.
- Half... I'm coming down.

2709
02:38:43,624 --> 02:38:47,174
Shit! Goddamn it!

2710
02:38:47,254 --> 02:38:50,843
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could
just ask the guy for the big bag.

2711
02:38:50,923 --> 02:38:53,512
- Go get a bag, man.
- Here, here.

2712
02:38:53,592 --> 02:38:58,352
- Lady, I can't take it.
- No, you can, you can. You've been so nice to me.

2713
02:38:58,432 --> 02:39:01,851
- Yes, just hold the top open.
All right? And I can...

2714
02:39:05,141 --> 02:39:07,851
Oh, God, it's him. You have to stop him.

2715
02:39:07,941 --> 02:39:12,030
He said he was gonna kill me.
You should just stop him.

2716
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:14,650
Mr. Roth... Mr. Roth...
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.

2717
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:16,660
Hold on a second. Hey.

2718
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:20,030
- She's driving away.
There's nothing we can do.

2719
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:22,949
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look, look.

2720
02:39:23,039 --> 02:39:26,119
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.

2721
02:39:26,209 --> 02:39:30,288
- There's nothing we can do. She had the keys.
- She's on the account.

2722
02:39:30,378 --> 02:39:32,938
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo station.
- Okay. Let's do it.

2723
02:39:44,267 --> 02:39:47,936
- We're placing you under arrest for...
- For what?

2724
02:39:48,055 --> 02:39:50,975
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- For what?

2725
02:39:51,055 --> 02:39:54,655
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- But I'm just trying to leave.

2726
02:39:54,895 --> 02:39:56,944
After all
the threats and all the bullshit...

2727
02:39:56,984 --> 02:39:59,104
it turned out Ginger
didn't tell them anything.

2728
02:39:59,194 --> 02:40:02,615
- But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
- But it was mine.

2729
02:40:02,735 --> 02:40:06,365
- They had all the pieces they needed.
- But I didn't do anything.

2730
02:40:06,405 --> 02:40:11,373
- Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.
- F.B.I.! We have a warrant!

2731
02:40:11,453 --> 02:40:13,453
Between Piscano complaining on the wire...

2732
02:40:13,543 --> 02:40:16,963
between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license...

2733
02:40:17,043 --> 02:40:21,002
Paradise. We managed
to really fuck it all up.

2734
02:40:21,082 --> 02:40:24,302
- Mom.
- Yeah, someone's at the fuckin' door now.

2735
02:40:24,382 --> 02:40:26,301
F.B.I. We have a federal search warrant.

2736
02:40:26,341 --> 02:40:29,511
I got wind of the pinches
coming down, so I took off.

2737
02:40:29,591 --> 02:40:31,600
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?

2738
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:33,620
- My name is Mark Casper. Special Agent F.B.I.
- Yeah?

2739
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:35,660
- Can I make a fuckin' phone call?
- Hey, hold it a minute.

2740
02:40:35,680 --> 02:40:38,250
You can make a phone call, but you
don't have to talk to us like that.

2741
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:41,270
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.

2742
02:40:41,310 --> 02:40:44,938
They got almost everybody else.
- This area is seized!

2743
02:40:45,028 --> 02:40:49,698
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.

2744
02:40:53,658 --> 02:40:55,988
Put every box on the table.

2745
02:41:01,118 --> 02:41:04,287
Ah, yes. Here we are. Little craps figures.

2746
02:41:04,337 --> 02:41:06,296
Green? Don't even ask.

2747
02:41:06,336 --> 02:41:09,756
- $30,000 of yours.
- No, he didn't. That's why it wasn't valid.

2748
02:41:09,796 --> 02:41:13,086
I was being extorted. I'm willing
to tell you whatever you want to know.

2749
02:41:13,176 --> 02:41:15,156
- I've got nothing to hide here.
- Now for the best.

2750
02:41:15,176 --> 02:41:19,555
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.

2751
02:41:19,635 --> 02:41:23,304
- Oh, this is good. Bingo.
- He might as well have given them a fuckin' blueprint.

2752
02:41:23,354 --> 02:41:26,684
Everybody's names, addresses,
dates, everything.

2753
02:41:26,774 --> 02:41:30,393
Look at this. Thank you so much,
Mr. Piscano. How considerate of you.

2754
02:41:30,483 --> 02:41:33,313
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.

2755
02:41:33,403 --> 02:41:35,823
What a fuckin' balloon-head.
- What are you guys doing?

2756
02:41:35,903 --> 02:41:38,113
- Take it easy.
- Wait!

2757
02:41:38,153 --> 02:41:40,112
- Wait a minute! He's sick! Oh, God!
- Move back.

2758
02:41:40,152 --> 02:41:42,782
- I think it's his heart! Oh, God! Is he breathing?
- C.P.R. Now!

2759
02:41:42,822 --> 02:41:44,902
Poor Artie. He got so upset,
he had a heart attack...

2760
02:41:44,952 --> 02:41:47,242
and dropped dead right
in front of his wife.

2761
02:41:47,332 --> 02:41:49,467
- Calm down!
- Artie! No, I won't calm down!

2762
02:41:49,502 --> 02:41:51,783
- He's my husband! Artie! Artie!
- We can't help him if...

2763
02:41:54,751 --> 02:41:56,671
And at the end of the day...

2764
02:41:56,751 --> 02:41:59,300
they finally came to see me
with the pictures.

2765
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:02,129
Why protect a friend
who betrayed you like that?

2766
02:42:02,219 --> 02:42:04,139
But I didn't want to look at them.

2767
02:42:04,179 --> 02:42:06,719
I didn't want to look at the guys
who brought them either.

2768
02:42:09,429 --> 02:42:12,979
Your Honor, as you can see,
my clients are elderly and infirm.

2769
02:42:13,018 --> 02:42:16,188
Any incarceration could
pose a serious health risk.

2770
02:42:16,228 --> 02:42:18,509
When the bosses were arrested,
some of them were so old...

2771
02:42:18,567 --> 02:42:20,527
they needed doctors at their arraignment.

2772
02:42:20,567 --> 02:42:23,607
Pre-trial Services recommends
that bail remain as presently set.

2773
02:42:23,697 --> 02:42:26,426
- We're going to take a recess.
- When it looked like they could get...

2774
02:42:26,446 --> 02:42:29,486
25 years to life in prison
just for skimmin' a casino...

2775
02:42:29,576 --> 02:42:32,707
sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew
people were going to get clipped.

2776
02:42:32,747 --> 02:42:38,125
So, the day of the arraignment, they had this
meeting right in the back of the courthouse.

2777
02:42:38,205 --> 02:42:42,665
See, when something like this happens,
you know how things are gonna work out.

2778
02:42:42,715 --> 02:42:46,965
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?

2779
02:42:47,045 --> 02:42:49,844
He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.

2780
02:42:49,924 --> 02:42:52,134
Stand-up guy just like his old man.

2781
02:42:52,224 --> 02:42:54,514
That's the way I see it.

2782
02:42:54,594 --> 02:42:58,433
I agree. He's solid. He's a fuckin' Marine.

2783
02:42:58,512 --> 02:43:02,932
He's okay. He always was.
Remo, what do you think?

2784
02:43:04,232 --> 02:43:09,522
Look... why take a chance?

2785
02:43:09,612 --> 02:43:12,901
At least, that's the way I feel about it.

2786
02:43:12,991 --> 02:43:16,700
Call Artie. Tell him, I don't care what...

2787
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:19,831
- he's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.
- It's done.

2788
02:43:19,951 --> 02:43:23,120
It's terribly important. I gotta have
a conversation with that guy...

2789
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:34,008
As much as they liked him,
I mean, he wasn't one of us.

2790
02:43:34,088 --> 02:43:37,338
He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew,
he could have talked.

2791
02:43:37,468 --> 02:43:39,968
Otherwise, Stoney might still be alive.

2792
02:43:43,888 --> 02:43:46,647
The first one to skip was John Nance.

2793
02:43:46,727 --> 02:43:49,857
He found a nice, warm,
secluded place in Costa Rica.

2794
02:43:49,937 --> 02:43:53,396
He thought nobody would find him there.

2795
02:44:13,334 --> 02:44:16,254
But then his kid got nabbed
by the Feds for drugs.

2796
02:44:16,334 --> 02:44:19,253
So, naturally, the bosses were
afraid he'd come out of hiding...

2797
02:44:19,333 --> 02:44:21,923
just to save his kid and give them all up.

2798
02:44:22,053 --> 02:44:23,923
So...

2799
02:44:26,763 --> 02:44:30,301
Where you goin', jag-off?

2800
02:44:30,391 --> 02:44:32,391
But, anyway, they all had to follow.

2801
02:44:32,511 --> 02:44:35,351
Everybody went down.

2802
02:44:35,481 --> 02:44:37,351
Fuck you.

2803
02:44:40,151 --> 02:44:42,020
Before you knew it...

2804
02:44:42,150 --> 02:44:45,610
anybody who knew anything
wound up gettin' whacked.

2805
02:44:54,038 --> 02:44:56,448
Oh, no! No! No!

2806
02:45:01,169 --> 02:45:03,918
After Ginger took off,
she wasn't much help to anybody.

2807
02:45:04,048 --> 02:45:07,877
She found some pimps, lowlifes,
druggies and bikers in L.A.

2808
02:45:07,967 --> 02:45:11,507
In a few months, they went through
all the money and all the jewels.

2809
02:45:36,904 --> 02:45:39,653
After they found her body...

2810
02:45:39,743 --> 02:45:42,992
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.

2811
02:45:45,582 --> 02:45:48,663
He said they gave her a hot dose.

2812
02:45:48,753 --> 02:45:54,592
In the end, all she had left was 3,600
in mint condition coins.

2813
02:46:15,519 --> 02:46:19,739
No matter what the Feds or the papers
might have said about my car bombing...

2814
02:46:19,819 --> 02:46:22,568
it was amateur night, you could tell.

2815
02:46:22,658 --> 02:46:27,037
Whoever it was, they put
the dynamite under the passenger side.

2816
02:46:27,157 --> 02:46:30,657
But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew...

2817
02:46:30,707 --> 02:46:36,036
was that that model car was made with
a metal plate under the driver's seat.

2818
02:46:36,126 --> 02:46:38,957
It's the only thing that saved my life.

2819
02:46:51,015 --> 02:46:55,265
The bombing was never authorized,
but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.

2820
02:46:55,685 --> 02:46:58,063
- Hey, Nicky.
And so did the powers that be.

2821
02:46:58,183 --> 02:47:00,853
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

2822
02:47:00,933 --> 02:47:02,813
It took months for everything to calm down.

2823
02:47:02,943 --> 02:47:04,813
But, finally, my guys got out on bail...

2824
02:47:04,943 --> 02:47:08,782
and the bosses wanted me to send
my brother Dominick out to Vegas.

2825
02:47:08,862 --> 02:47:11,152
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin' dollars.

2826
02:47:11,282 --> 02:47:15,742
I mean, it was still way too hot
for me to even go near Vegas.

2827
02:47:15,822 --> 02:47:18,791
So I set up a meeting
with the guys way out in the sticks.

2828
02:47:18,871 --> 02:47:21,911
I didn't want my brother to get fucked
around. I mean, what's right is right.

2829
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:24,330
They don't give a fuck about...

2830
02:47:25,170 --> 02:47:27,040
Holy fuckin'!

2831
02:47:27,170 --> 02:47:29,301
What the fuck...

2832
02:47:29,381 --> 02:47:31,670
Come on, motherfucker!

2833
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:34,680
Tough guys! You and your fuckin' brother!

2834
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:38,219
You fuckin' scumbags! No more!

2835
02:47:41,729 --> 02:47:44,898
- Frankie!
- No more! You see? Watch!

2836
02:47:48,648 --> 02:47:52,488
- Frankie! Frankie! You piece of shit!
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!

2837
02:47:52,568 --> 02:47:55,816
Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of shit!

2838
02:47:59,326 --> 02:48:01,746
No, no, no, no!

2839
02:48:01,866 --> 02:48:03,906
Take this motherfucker out!

2840
02:48:11,415 --> 02:48:13,754
Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.

2841
02:48:13,874 --> 02:48:17,254
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone. Frankie.

2842
02:48:18,754 --> 02:48:24,224
All right. Strip him.

2843
02:48:24,264 --> 02:48:28,433
No balls. You got no fuckin' balls.

2844
02:48:28,553 --> 02:48:32,602
Ah, Dominick. Ah, Dom.

2845
02:48:37,192 --> 02:48:39,861
Dominick. Dominick.

2846
02:48:39,941 --> 02:48:43,741
Dominick.

2847
02:48:45,151 --> 02:48:47,071
Oh, Dominick.

2848
02:49:02,838 --> 02:49:07,089
Come on, come on.

2849
02:49:07,129 --> 02:49:09,088
- Bury them?
- Bury them.

2850
02:49:12,308 --> 02:49:14,217
The word was out.

2851
02:49:14,307 --> 02:49:16,227
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.

2852
02:49:16,307 --> 02:49:21,897
How much were they gonna take? So they
made an example of him and his brother.

2853
02:49:21,977 --> 02:49:25,606
They buried them
while they were still breathing.

2854
02:49:42,284 --> 02:49:44,704
Mister, you all right? Watch out!

2855
02:49:48,962 --> 02:49:51,842
- Mister, you all right?
- Yeah.

2856
02:49:54,052 --> 02:49:57,803
They had other ideas for me.

2857
02:50:05,561 --> 02:50:07,521
We need some help over here!

2858
02:50:07,561 --> 02:50:11,020
You sure are lucky, mister.

2859
02:50:29,788 --> 02:50:32,828
The town will never be the same.

2860
02:50:32,918 --> 02:50:36,877
After the Tangiers,
the big corporations took it all over.

2861
02:50:36,957 --> 02:50:39,627
Today it looks like Disneyland.

2862
02:50:46,846 --> 02:50:48,886
And while the kids
play cardboard pirates...

2863
02:50:48,926 --> 02:50:52,266
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments
and Junior's college money...

2864
02:50:52,346 --> 02:50:55,106
on the poker slots.

2865
02:50:58,105 --> 02:51:02,234
In the old days, dealers knew your name,
what you drank, what you played.

2866
02:51:02,274 --> 02:51:04,364
Today, it's like checkin' into an airport.

2867
02:51:04,404 --> 02:51:07,693
And if you order room service,
you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.

2868
02:51:07,783 --> 02:51:11,913
Today it's all gone. You got a whale
show up with four million in a suitcase...

2869
02:51:11,953 --> 02:51:17,043
and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is
gonna want his social security number.

2870
02:51:18,912 --> 02:51:21,461
After the Teamsters
got knocked out of the box...

2871
02:51:21,541 --> 02:51:24,921
the corporations tore down practically
every one of the old casinos.

2872
02:51:24,961 --> 02:51:29,381
And where did the money come
from to rebuild the Pyramids?

2873
02:51:29,461 --> 02:51:32,430
Junk bonds.

2874
02:51:36,431 --> 02:51:38,640
Still not sure?

2875
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:40,640
Probable. Maybe questionable.

2876
02:51:40,730 --> 02:51:43,019
Let me know as soon as you can find out.

2877
02:51:43,099 --> 02:51:47,609
But in the end, I wound up
right back where I started.

2878
02:51:47,649 --> 02:51:49,609
I could still pick winners...

2879
02:51:49,689 --> 02:51:52,988
and I could still make money
for all kinds of people back home.

2880
02:51:53,068 --> 02:51:56,028
And why mess up a good thing?

2881
02:51:56,118 --> 02:51:58,027
And that's that.

2882
02:54:33,628 --> 02:54:36,798
# Sometimes I wonder why
I spend the lonely nights #

2883
02:54:40,588 --> 02:54:44,806
# Dreaming of a song #

2884
02:54:44,886 --> 02:54:49,346
# The melody haunts my memory #

2885
02:54:52,896 --> 02:54:56,486
# And I am once again with you #

2886
02:54:59,606 --> 02:55:03,196
# When our love was new #

2887
02:55:03,276 --> 02:55:07,114
# And each kiss an inspiration #

2888
02:55:09,034 --> 02:55:12,994
# Ah, but that was long ago #

2889
02:55:13,074 --> 02:55:15,624
# And now my consolation #

2890
02:55:15,664 --> 02:55:18,663
# Is in the stardust of a song #

2891
02:55:22,292 --> 02:55:24,842
# Beside a garden wall #

2892
02:55:24,922 --> 02:55:27,462
# When stars were bright #

2893
02:55:27,512 --> 02:55:29,511
# And you were in my arms #

2894
02:55:32,011 --> 02:55:35,681
# The nightingale told his fairy tale #

2895
02:55:40,191 --> 02:55:42,519
# Of paradise #

2896
02:55:42,559 --> 02:55:45,520
# Where roses grew #

2897
02:55:49,320 --> 02:55:51,909
# Though I dream in vain #

2898
02:55:55,619 --> 02:55:58,159
# In my heart #

2899
02:55:58,199 --> 02:56:00,498
# It will remain #

2900
02:56:02,368 --> 02:56:05,707
# My stardust melody #

2901
02:56:05,747 --> 02:56:08,757
# The memory #

2902
02:56:08,837 --> 02:56:12,507
# Of love's refrain ##

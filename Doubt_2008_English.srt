1
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:02,000
Jimmy? Come on.
You're serving today.

2
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,167
Christine?
Where's my pants?

3
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:09,750
On the bed.
If they had teeth they would've bit you.

4
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:33,083
Jimmy! Go to the store,
buy me the newspaper and cigarettes.

5
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,083
Can't. Serving mass. I'm an altar boy.

6
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,292
- Hey, Kevin!
- Hey, Jimmy!

7
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,125
- There you are.
- Overslept.

8
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,333
Well, you made it. I'll do the cruets
if you light the charcoal.

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,833
You think I'm fat?

10
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,042
You're all right. What?
Clothes don't fit?

11
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,667
No, they fit.

12
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,042
You're gonna be going to the bakery
after mass.

13
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,208
I am? Why don't you go?

14
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,417
I'm gonna be making breakfast.

15
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:00,583
I can make breakfast.

16
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,375
When have you ever?

17
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,125
Funny man.

18
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,417
- Good morning, Connie.
- Good morning.

19
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,083
<i>Holy God, we praise thy name</i>

20
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,042
Good morning, Father.

21
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:37,167
<i>Lord of all, we bow before thee</i>

22
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:43,917
<i>All on Earth thy scepter claim</i>

23
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:50,542
<i>All in heaven above adore thee</i>

24
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:56,667
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

25
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:02,792
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

26
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:09,125
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

27
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:16,958
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

28
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,667
<i>Be seated.</i>

29
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,083
<i>What do you do when you're not sure?</i>

30
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,917
<i>That's the topic of my sermon today.</i>

31
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:49,125
<i>Last year when
President Kennedy was assassinated,</i>

32
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:54,417
<i>who among us did not experience
the most profound disorientation?</i>

33
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,833
<i>Despair?</i>

34
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,625
<i>Which way? What now?</i>

35
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,500
<i>What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?</i>

36
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,917
<i>It was a time of people
sitting together,</i>

37
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:15,292
<i>bound together
by a common feeling of hopelessness.</i>

38
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,125
<i>But think of that.</i>

39
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,750
<i>Your bond with your fellow being
was your despair.</i>

40
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,667
<i>It was a public experience.
It was awful,</i>

41
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,750
<i>but we were in it together.</i>

42
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:41,917
<i>How much worse is it then
for the lone man, the lone woman,</i>

43
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,583
<i>stricken by a private calamity?</i>

44
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:52,917
<i>"No one knows I'm sick." "No one
knows I've lost my last real friend."</i>

45
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,500
<i>"No one knows
I've done something wrong."</i>

46
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,417
<i>Imagine the isolation.</i>

47
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,000
<i>Now you see the world
as through a window.</i>

48
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,292
<i>On one side of the glass,
happy untroubled people,</i>

49
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,000
<i>and on the other side, you.</i>

50
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,458
- God bless you, Sister.
- Thank you.

51
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,208
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

52
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:26,958
<i>A cargo ship sank one night.
It caught fire and went down,</i>

53
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,708
<i>and only this one sailor survived.</i>

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,208
<i>He found a lifeboat, rigged a sail,</i>

55
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,750
<i>and being of a nautical discipline</i>

56
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:40,750
<i>turned his eyes to the heavens
and read the stars.</i>

57
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,875
<i>He set a course for his home,
and, exhausted, fell asleep.</i>

58
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:46,750
Just keeps going on.

59
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,542
<i>Clouds rolled in,</i>

60
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:55,708
<i>and for the next 20 nights,
he could no longer see the stars.</i>

61
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,375
<i>He thought he was on course,
but there was no way to be certain.</i>

62
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,042
<i>And as the days rolled on,
and the sailor wasted away,</i>

63
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,375
<i>he began to have doubts.</i>

64
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:16,292
<i>- He just keeps on going.
- Had he set his course right?</i>

65
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:19,875
<i>Was he still going on
towards his home?</i>

66
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,917
<i>Or was he horribly lost
and doomed to a terrible death?</i>

67
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,458
<i>No way to know.</i>

68
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,708
<i>The message of the constellations,</i>

69
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:38,542
<i>had he imagined it because
of his desperate circumstance?</i>

70
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,583
<i>- Or had he seen truth once...
- Straighten up!</i>

71
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:47,750
<i>...and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?</i>

72
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,417
<i>There are those of you in church today</i>

73
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,792
<i>who know exactly
the crisis of faith I describe,</i>

74
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,708
<i>and I wanna say to you,</i>

75
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,583
<i>doubt can be a bond as powerful
and sustaining as certainty.</i>

76
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,750
<i>When you are lost, you are not alone.</i>

77
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,125
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

78
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,417
<i>Please rise.</i>

79
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,417
<i>Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow</i>

80
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,875
<i>Praise him all creatures here...</i>

81
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:56,083
- Hey, Father.
- Hey, champ.

82
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,625
That was some sermon.

83
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,542
Did it mean something to you?

84
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,292
I wanna do that. I wanna be a priest.

85
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,417
You'd be a good one, I'm sure. Here.

86
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,042
Take a look.

87
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,083
See?

88
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:36,083
- She's dancing. Kind of neat?
- Yeah.

89
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,792
Here. You try.

90
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,375
That's for you. Take it.

91
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,750
- Thank you, Father.
- Welcome.

92
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,250
Like Noah's Ark, girls. Two by two.

93
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,958
Maryanne said it.
Let's do it together.

94
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,250
Okay.
Yeah. It's true.

95
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,792
And did I tell you that Jessica's
having a sleepover on Saturday?

96
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,708
Morning, Sister James.

97
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,542
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Beautiful day.

98
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,083
Not too bad.
How're the criminals doing today?

99
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,875
- Not bad, Father.
- Good, Father.

100
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,750
- Morning, champ.
- Morning, Father Flynn.

101
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,708
You wash those hands today,
Mr. London?

102
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,542
I washed them, Father.

103
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,667
I don't know. They're a different color
than your neck.

104
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,292
Morning.
Morning, Father Flynn.

105
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,375
- Sister, are we having the test today?
- Get in line.

106
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,042
Tomorrow, William.

107
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,375
- Is it long division?
- Among other things.

108
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,125
- Sister.
- Good morning, Sister.

109
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,250
- How much of it will be long division?
- Boy!

110
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:08,083
William London. Come up here.

111
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:17,750
Come smartly, now.
Don't make me wait.

112
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,708
What did he do?
He touched Sister James.

113
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,458
The dragon is hungry.

114
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,458
You don't touch a nun.

115
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,750
Take out your history books, please.
Turn to page 683.

116
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:47,125
- Yes, Ralph.
- I forgot my history book.

117
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,542
You can look on with Raymond.

118
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,417
Mr. London?

119
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,542
- Do you have your history book?
- No, Sister.

120
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,875
- Share with Mr. Malloy, please.
- Do I have to? His breath stinks!

121
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,958
I'm sure Mr. Malloy's
breath is just fine.

122
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,208
Be seated.

123
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,917
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the
32nd president of the United States.

124
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,875
That barrette out of your hair,
Miss Horan.

125
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,417
Yes, Sister.

126
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,250
Morning, Sister James.
Continue.

127
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,708
Franklin D. Roosevelt, together with

128
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,875
Abraham Lincoln
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

129
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,292
was perhaps our greatest president.
When he assumed office,

130
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,458
13 million people in this country
were unemployed.

131
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,042
They'd lost hope,

132
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,208
and President Roosevelt
said to these people,

133
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,542
"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself."

134
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,125
What did he mean by that? James?

135
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,792
I think he was trying to say
there's nothing really wrong.

136
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:05,375
- You know? So don't get so emotional.
- Maybe.

137
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,458
Maybe he was saying that
the world is good

138
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,292
and we need only work together
to overcome our problems.

139
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,417
What's this, Mr. Conroy?

140
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,542
I don't know, Sister.

141
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,250
You don't know you have a wire
coming out of your ear?

142
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,458
- No.
- Huh?

143
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,417
Huh?

144
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,958
No, Sister. I didn't.

145
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,417
You come with me, boy.

146
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,542
Go.

147
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,583
Who knows what the New Deal was?

148
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:00,000
<i>The first noel</i>

149
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,458
<i>The angels did say</i>

150
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:09,208
<i>Was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay</i>

151
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,042
I love this song.

152
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:17,083
<i>In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep</i>

153
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:23,917
<i>On a cold winter's night
that was so deep</i>

154
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:43,042
This past Sunday, what do you think
that sermon was about? Sister James?

155
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,708
Huh?

156
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,083
What was
Father Flynn's sermon about?

157
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:55,208
Well, doubt.
He was talking about doubt.

158
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:00,708
- Why?
- Excuse me, Sister?

159
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,917
Well, sermons come from somewhere,
don't they?

160
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,292
Is Father Flynn in doubt?

161
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:09,542
Is he concerned
that someone else is in doubt?

162
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,125
I suppose you'd have to ask him.

163
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,375
No, that would not be appropriate.

164
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,917
He is my superior,

165
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,875
and if he were troubled
he should confess it to a fellow priest

166
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,708
or to the monsignor.

167
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:23,375
We do not share
intimate information with priests.

168
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,417
- No.
- That's true.

169
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,292
What are we saying?

170
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,708
I want you all to be alert.

171
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:40,750
I am concerned, perhaps needlessly,
about matters in St. Nicholas School.

172
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,875
Academically?

173
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:52,250
I was not inviting a guessing game,
Sister Raymond.

174
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,125
Missy! Get away from her,
and sit down.

175
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,333
- May I join you, Sister Aloysius?
- Yes.

176
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,333
- Chicken chow mein.
- Sister Veronica's favorite.

177
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,500
It's very good.

178
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,750
I like the noodles. I like the crunch.

179
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:30,333
- What happened to William London?
- I sent him home.

180
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:34,500
- Oh, dear. So he's still bleeding?
- Yes.

181
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,667
His nose just let loose

182
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,250
and started gushing
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

183
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,875
Was it spontaneous?

184
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,208
- What?
- His nosebleed.

185
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,208
- What else would it be?
- Self-induced.

186
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,333
Mmm-hmm.

187
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,542
You mean you think

188
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,917
he might have intentionally
given himself a nosebleed?

189
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,333
Exactly.

190
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,667
No.

191
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,583
You are a very innocent person,
Sister James.

192
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,542
William London is a fidgety boy.

193
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,917
If you do not keep right on him,
he will do anything to escape his chair.

194
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:14,333
He would set his foot on fire
for half a day out of school.

195
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:18,000
Here. Sister, allow me to help you.
Your sleeve.

196
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:19,958
Uh-oh.

197
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,375
- Let's see.
- Oh, thank you, Sister.

198
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,500
- Sister Veronica is going blind.
- Oh, how horrible.

199
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,917
If they find out in the rectory,
she'll be gone.

200
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,333
So if she looks unsteady,
take her hand.

201
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:44,917
Ordinarily I assign my most
experienced teachers to eighth grade,

202
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,375
but I am working within constraints.

203
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,417
- Are you in control of your class?
- I think so.

204
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:59,417
Usually more students
are sent down to me.

205
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,167
I try to take care of things myself.

206
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,250
That can be an error.

207
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,708
You are answerable to me,
I to the monsignor,

208
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,500
he to the bishop,
and so on up to the Holy Father.

209
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,167
There is a chain. Make use of it.

210
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,708
Candy?

211
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,708
Cough drops.

212
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,167
Candy by another name.

213
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,542
How is Donald Miller doing?

214
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,833
- Steady.
- Good.

215
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,083
That girl, Noreen Horan.

216
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,250
I've seated her
as far away from the boys as possible.

217
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,708
- Doesn't do much good.
- Mmm.

218
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:44,083
Just get her through intact.

219
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,000
What's this?

220
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:57,750
The wind is so peripatetic this year.

221
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,333
- Is that the word I want?
- Is something the matter?

222
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,083
What?

223
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,500
Is something the matter?
No.

224
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:14,417
- Why? Is something the matter?
- I don't think so.

225
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,042
- Well, then, nothing's the matter then.
- Yes.

226
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,042
- What's this?
- A pen.

227
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,542
A ballpoint pen.

228
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,917
The students are not using them
for assignments, I hope.

229
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,083
No, of course not.

230
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,417
I am sorry I allowed even
cartridge pens into this school.

231
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,000
Always easy way out, these days.

232
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:40,417
Every easy choice today
will have its consequence tomorrow.

233
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,500
- Mark my words.
- Yes, Sister.

234
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,500
Ballpoints make them press down.

235
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,417
When they press down,
they write like monkeys.

236
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,375
- I don't allow them ballpoint pens.
- And yet here one is.

237
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:56,333
Penmanship is dying
all across this country.

238
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,542
I hope not.

239
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,542
You should frame something.

240
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:06,875
Put it up on the blackboard.
Put the pope up.

241
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,375
That's the wrong pope. He's deceased.

242
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:15,250
I don't care what pope it is.
Use the glass to see behind you.

243
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:19,500
Children should think you have eyes
in the back of your head.

244
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,542
Wouldn't that be a little frightening?

245
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,375
Only to the ones
who are up to no good.

246
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,333
Relax. Put it up there.

247
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,417
All right, now.

248
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,667
The thing about shooting
from the foul line is it's psychological.

249
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,542
All right, come up with a routine.

250
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,458
You shift your weight, move your hips...

251
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,958
Yeah, you think that's funny, Ralph?

252
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,708
You know what's funny is
you never getting a foul shot.

253
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:59,375
All right, concentrate on the routine,
and you'll forget to get tensed up.

254
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,833
All right, go ahead, Jimmy.

255
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:13,375
Good man. You listen. That's good.
All right, now sit down, everyone.

256
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,875
Good.

257
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:22,250
On another matter, I've noticed
several of you guys got dirty nails.

258
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,833
All right, I don't want to see that.

259
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,583
I'm not talking about
the length of your nails.

260
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,167
I'm talking about cleanliness.

261
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,250
See, look at my nails.

262
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,583
- All right, they're long.
- Whoa!

263
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:45,083
Yeah, I like them a little long,
but look at how clean they are.

264
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,667
That makes it okay.

265
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,750
The climpity-clomp.
Clomp-clomp-clomp.

266
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,083
Harder than a herd of elephants.

267
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,708
You are wicked!

268
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,750
No, I told her, "You're her mother.

269
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:19,042
"You raised her. You fed her.
You tell her she's fat."

270
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,750
But wait, how fat is she?

271
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,500
- What, the mother or the daughter?
- The daughter.

272
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,875
I never met the daughter.

273
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,208
- What about the mother?
- Fat.

274
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,000
Father, we having practice
after school?

275
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,375
If you guys want it, we can have it.
Let me know.

276
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,417
The Fascist governments
of Germany and Italy

277
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,875
were already working together.

278
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,917
They formed the Pact of Steel.

279
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,417
The Pact of Steel was...

280
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:43,667
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,542
...a military alliance between
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

282
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:53,250
Mr. London, get back in your seat
and stop bothering Miss Horan, please.

283
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,083
Now, who can tell me...

284
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,875
Yes?

285
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,875
Yes. Of course, Father.

286
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,750
Donald? You should go to the rectory.

287
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:23,250
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

288
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:29,542
Go one, two, three, touch.
One, two, three, kick.

289
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:34,875
And back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front. Again.

290
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,042
<i>We began to dance</i>

291
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,750
<i>Swaying to and fro</i>

292
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,958
<i>And soon I knew
I'd never let him go</i>

293
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:48,792
- Raymond, what are you doing?
- The mashed potato.

294
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,042
You're supposed to be doing
the bossa nova.

295
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,250
- But I know the mashed potato.
- Oh...

296
00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:00,958
All right, now follow.
Back, side, front, kick.

297
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:05,958
Back, side... One, two, three, kick.

298
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:10,875
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

299
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:16,542
Let me get in front of you
so that you can see what I'm doing.

300
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,500
And one, two, three, touch.

301
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:23,667
One, two, three, kick.

302
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,667
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

303
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,292
Okay. This is really good.
Very good there.

304
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,208
<i>Now I'm glad to say</i>

305
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,208
<i>I'm his bride to be</i>

306
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:44,417
<i>And we're gonna raise a family</i>

307
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:18,708
- Donald, are you feeling ill?
- No.

308
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,375
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

309
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:28,875
- Are you all right?
- I just want to go home.

310
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,958
- Good afternoon, Sister.
- Good afternoon, Sister James.

311
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,333
Sister, can I speak with you
about Donald Miller?

312
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:03,542
Is he being accepted?
He has no friends.

313
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:07,375
That would be a lot
to expect after only two months.

314
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,708
- Has anyone hit him?
- No.

315
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,208
Someone will.

316
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:21,375
And when that happens,
send them right down to me.

317
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,208
I'm not so sure anyone will.

318
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,833
This parish serves Irish
and Italian families.

319
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:32,333
Someone will hit Donald Miller.

320
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,625
He has a protector.

321
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,375
Who?

322
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,000
Father Flynn.

323
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:52,667
What?

324
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,542
He's taken an interest.

325
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,375
I told you to come to me,
but I hoped you never would.

326
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,042
Maybe I shouldn't have.

327
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:27,000
So, it's happened.

328
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:33,375
What? Oh, no. I'm not telling you that.
I'm not even certain what you mean.

329
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,833
Oh, excuse me there, Sisters.

330
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,792
No bother. We're done here.
Come, Sister.

331
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,458
What have you seen?

332
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,083
It is unsettling
to look at people with suspicion.

333
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,792
I feel less close to God.

334
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,000
When you take a step
to address wrongdoing,

335
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:03,375
you are taking a step away from God,
but in his service.

336
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,958
What have you seen?

337
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,708
Good afternoon, Sisters.

338
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,542
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson.
Why the cat?

339
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,250
'Cause there's a mouse.
Want some tea?

340
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,250
If you don't want to dance with her,
don't dance with her.

341
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,333
- Well, is it wrong?
- No.

342
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:24,042
But what if the girl turns you down?

343
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:29,292
All right, you have the right
to ask a girl to dance.

344
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:32,125
All right,
she has the right to turn you down.

345
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,667
The trick is, don't take it to heart.

346
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:38,125
What if they all turn you down?

347
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,583
Well, then you become a priest.

348
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,750
All right, next question.

349
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,000
What have you seen?

350
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:07,667
He called Donald Miller to the rectory.

351
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,458
- What for?
- A talk.

352
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:10,625
- Alone?
- Yes.

353
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,708
- When?
- A week ago during class.

354
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,417
Why didn't you tell me?

355
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:18,750
I didn't think
there was anything wrong with it.

356
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,042
Of all the children, Donald Miller.

357
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,208
I suppose it makes sense.

358
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,458
- How does it make sense?
- He's isolated.

359
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:37,708
- I don't know that anything is wrong.
- Our first Negro student.

360
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:42,208
I thought there would be fighting.
Thought we...

361
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,083
A parent or two to deal with.

362
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:51,708
I should have foreseen this possibility.

363
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,000
How could you imagine it?

364
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:57,833
Well, it's my job
to outshine the fox in cleverness.

365
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,250
- That is my job.
- But maybe it's nothing.

366
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,708
Then why do you look like
you've seen the devil?

367
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,792
It's just the way the boy acted
when he came back to class.

368
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,875
- He said something?
- No, it was his expression.

369
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,833
He looked frightened.

370
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:28,250
And he put his head on the desk
in the most peculiar way, and...

371
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:35,458
And one other thing,
I think there was alcohol on his breath.

372
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:44,833
There was alcohol on his breath.

373
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,167
Years ago at Saint Boniface
there was a priest.

374
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:13,458
But I had Father Scully then.

375
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,833
Here, there's no man I can go to.
Men run everything.

376
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:24,958
We are going to have to
stop him ourselves.

377
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,833
There we go. She got him. Takes a cat.

378
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,750
Yes, it does.

379
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Yes, it does.

380
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,458
This towel
will never be dead white again.

381
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:27,917
Yes, it will.

382
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,458
Mrs. Carson.
I'm fine.

383
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,583
- What happened?
- There's a branch down.

384
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,542
- Are you all right, Sister?
- She didn't see it.

385
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:39,750
Fine. Just bushwhacked.
No need for a fuss.

386
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,792
You just go lie down.
I'll bring you some tea.

387
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,708
Come with me.
I just...

388
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,667
- I'll get you a compress.
- I did not fail to see it.

389
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,417
<i>- Hello? Yes, Sister.
- Mr. McGuinn.</i>

390
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,500
Could you look in on the courtyard?
I've got branches falling.

391
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,792
<i>- What has?
- A branch has!</i>

392
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:04,042
Watch your step here, Sister.
I'll cut it up.

393
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,750
The world is crashing, Michael.

394
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:12,167
I haven't heard a wind like that
since I left Mullingar.

395
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:15,833
I've never known a wind like it.
The wind has changed.

396
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:41,542
What are you doing out here, Conroy?

397
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,667
I talked in class, Father.

398
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:59,125
Waiting for Sister Aloysius.

399
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,792
- She know you're here?
- She knows.

400
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,333
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Good of you to come by.

401
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,417
Morning, Sister Aloysius.
How are you today?

402
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:14,667
I'm very well, thank you.

403
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,875
- Mr. Conroy.
- Yes, Sister.

404
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,875
Mr. Transistor Radio.

405
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,792
Multiplication table, 10 times,
in its totality,

406
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,708
delivered to me tomorrow morning.

407
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,125
Legible, boy.

408
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,250
Return to class. Go. Go, go.

409
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:45,417
I'd invite you in,
but we're just short Sister James.

410
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,167
- Hear that wind last night?
- I certainly did.

411
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh.

412
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,083
Did I hear
Sister Veronica had an accident?

413
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,750
Yeah. Sister Veronica fell,
practically killed herself.

414
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,292
- Is she all right?
- Oh, she's fine.

415
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:14,500
- Her sight isn't good, is it?
- Her sight is fine. Nuns fall, you know.

416
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,625
Nah, I didn't know that.

417
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,250
It's the habit.
It catches us up more often than not.

418
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,417
Hmm.

419
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:25,542
We go down like dominoes.

420
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,333
- Am I past the time?
- Not at all.

421
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,000
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Sister.

422
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,250
I'm sorry I was delayed.

423
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:36,083
- I ran into Sister Veronica.
- How is she?

424
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,917
I'm afraid
she has a bit of a bloody nose.

425
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:42,125
I'm beginning to think
you're punching people.

426
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,875
Sister?

427
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,792
First, William London and now...

428
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:55,000
- Never mind. Well, come in, please.
- Sister.

429
00:39:57,208 --> 00:40:01,042
Please. Sit. Have a seat.

430
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,917
I actually have a hot pot of tea.

431
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:07,083
And close this,
but not quite for form's sake.

432
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,333
Father, would you care for a...

433
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:16,458
- Would you have a cup of tea, Father?
- I'd love a cup of tea.

434
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,208
- Sister, perhaps you could serve him.
- I'd be glad.

435
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,625
And yourself, of course.

436
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,917
Would you like a cup of tea,
Sister Aloysius?

437
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,750
No, I've already had my cup.

438
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:27,333
- Is there sugar?
- Sugar?

439
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:36,000
Yes, yes. Somewhere here.

440
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:41,958
I put it in the drawer for Lent last year.
Never remembered to take it out.

441
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,042
It mustn't have been much
to give up, then.

442
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,583
I'm sure you're right.
Here it is.

443
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:56,292
I'll serve you, although
for want of practice I'm a little clumsy.

444
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:03,000
- I see your fingernails.
- Wear them a little long.

445
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,375
- The sugar?
- Yes. One?

446
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,667
Three.

447
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,583
- Three?
- Sweet tooth.

448
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,125
Two. Three.

449
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,333
- Sister, you care for sugar?
- Never.

450
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,417
Not that there's
anything wrong with sugar.

451
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,667
Well, thank you, Father,
for making time for us.

452
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:27,458
We are at our wit's end.

453
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:31,667
I think it's an excellent idea
to rethink the Christmas pageant,

454
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,833
'cause last year's effort
was a little woebegone.

455
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,833
Oh, I loved it, but I love all pageants.
The hymns.

456
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:42,333
<i>O Little Town of Bethlehem, O Come,
O Come, Emmanuel, O Come...</i>

457
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,750
All right.
Thank you, Sister James.

458
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:45,917
So what do you think, Father?

459
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:48,375
Is there something new we could do?

460
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,958
Well, we all love the Christmas hymns,

461
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,750
but it might be jolly
to include a secular song.

462
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:57,083
- Secular?
- Yes.

463
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,292
<i>It's Beginning To Look A Lot
Like Christmas. Something like that.</i>

464
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,958
What would be
the point of a secular song?

465
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,250
Just fun.

466
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,458
<i>- Or Frosty the Snowman.
- That's a good one.</i>

467
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:11,833
We could have one of the boys
dress up as a snowman, dance around.

468
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,000
Which boy?

469
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,500
We'd do tryouts.

470
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:24,167
<i>Frosty the Snowman
espouses a pagan belief in magic.</i>

471
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,292
The snowman comes to life when
an enchanted hat is put on his head.

472
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:29,875
If the music were more somber,

473
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,125
people would realize the images
are disturbing and the song heretical.

474
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,583
<i>I never thought about
Frosty the Snowman like that.</i>

475
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:39,833
It should be banned from the airwaves.

476
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,167
<i>So, not Frosty the Snowman.</i>

477
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:48,167
<i>Oh, It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like
Christmas would be fine, I suppose.</i>

478
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:50,208
Parents would like it.

479
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:56,458
May I ask what you're writing down
with that ballpoint pen?

480
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,917
Oh, nothing. It's an idea for a sermon.

481
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:04,000
- Oh. You had one right now?
- I get them all the time.

482
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,875
How fortunate.

483
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,375
I forget them,
so I have to write them down.

484
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,417
Oh.

485
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,667
What is the idea?

486
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,250
Intolerance.

487
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,583
Would you like
a little more tea, Father?

488
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:24,000
Not yet.

489
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,833
It's a new time, Sister.

490
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:31,125
- What's new about it?
- Something inside of people is new.

491
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,792
There is nothing new under the sun.

492
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:39,125
The Church needs to change.

493
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:42,958
We should sing a song
from the radio now and then,

494
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:44,750
take the kids out for ice cream.

495
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,042
Sweet tooth.

496
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,125
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.

497
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,875
The point being?

498
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,167
We should be friendlier.

499
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,792
You know, the children and the parents

500
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,125
should see us
as members of their family.

501
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,958
But we are not members of
their family. We're different.

502
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:09,042
- Why? Because of our vows?
- Precisely.

503
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,750
I don't think we're so different.

504
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,583
You know, Sister,
I would take some more tea.

505
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:17,750
And they think we're different, yeah?

506
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,458
The working...

507
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,000
The working class people of this parish
trust us to be different.

508
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:26,625
I think we're getting off the subject.

509
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,375
Yes, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Back to it.

510
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:37,000
Yes?

511
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:39,250
Sister Raymond? Mmm.

512
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, you tell her to wash her face
and her neck and report to me at 3:00.

513
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,250
Yeah.

514
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:51,500
Excuse me. The Christmas pageant.

515
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,625
We must be careful

516
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,208
how Donald Miller is used
in the pageant.

517
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:59,500
- Easy there, Sister.
- Father.

518
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,083
All right, what about Donald Miller?

519
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,375
We must be careful, in the pageant,

520
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,500
that we neither hide Donald Miller
nor put him forward.

521
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:20,167
- Because of the color of his skin?
- That's right, yeah.

522
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:23,833
- Why?
- Oh, come, Father.

523
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:27,250
I think he should be treated
like every other boy.

524
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:32,542
Well, you yourself singled the boy out
for special attention.

525
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,500
You held a private meeting with him
at the rectory. A week ago?

526
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:41,708
Yes.

527
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:49,208
- What are we talking about?
- Donald Miller.

528
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:56,750
The boy acted strangely
when he returned to class.

529
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,625
He did?

530
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:03,208
When he returned from the rectory,
a little odd, yes.

531
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:05,708
Can you tell us why?

532
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:10,000
How did he act strangely?

533
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,750
He...

534
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:17,917
I'm not sure how to explain it.
He laid his head on the desk and...

535
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:23,458
Do you mean
you had some impression?

536
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,625
Yes.

537
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,208
And he'd come from the rectory,
so you're asking me?

538
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,667
Mmm. That's it.

539
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:30,667
Hmm.

540
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,958
Mmm.

541
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:33,583
Mmm.

542
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,208
Did you want to discuss the pageant?
Is that why I'm here?

543
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,208
Or is this what you wanted to discuss?

544
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:41,167
This.

545
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,667
Well, I'm a little uncomfortable.

546
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:48,583
- Why?
- Why do you think?

547
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:51,000
The boy's well-being
is my responsibility.

548
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,417
His well-being is not at issue.

549
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:57,875
I'm not satisfied
that that is true.

550
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,125
He was upset
when he returned to class.

551
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:04,000
- Did he say something?
- No.

552
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,708
What happened in the rectory?

553
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,333
Happened?

554
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:11,500
Mmm.

555
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,167
Nothing happened.
I had a talk with the boy.

556
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,750
- What about?
- Private matter.

557
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,917
He's 12 years old.
What could be private?

558
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,167
- Should I get...
- No.

559
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,542
I object to your tone.

560
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:33,208
This is not about my tone
or your tone, Father Flynn.

561
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,917
- It's about arriving at the truth.
- Of what?

562
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:44,875
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you? Hmm?

563
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,750
And you're controlling the expression
on your face right now, aren't you?

564
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,208
My face?

565
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,375
What exactly are you accusing me of?

566
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,083
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Father Flynn.

567
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:03,792
I am asking you to tell me
what happened in the rectory.

568
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:12,708
I don't wish to continue this.

569
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,125
And if you're dissatisfied with that,

570
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,250
I suggest
you speak to Monsignor Benedict.

571
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:23,667
I can only imagine this unfortunate
behavior is the result of overwork.

572
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:27,875
Have a good morning, Sister. Sister.

573
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:37,333
There was alcohol on his breath

574
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,250
when he returned
from his meeting with you.

575
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,500
Alcohol?

576
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:51,667
I did smell it on his breath.

577
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,375
Well?

578
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:04,583
- Let this alone.
- No.

579
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:17,667
Take your time, Father.
Would you like some more tea?

580
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:21,208
You should've let it alone.

581
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:24,625
Not possible.

582
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,958
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald
drinking altar wine.

583
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:43,333
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,

584
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:49,208
and he begged not to be removed
from the altar boys. I took pity on him.

585
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:53,833
I told him if no one else found out,
I'd let him stay on.

586
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,750
What a relief. That explains
everything. Thanks be to God.

587
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,833
Look, Sister, it was all a mistake.

588
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:07,250
And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?

589
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,542
Talk to him, by all means.

590
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,750
But now that the boy's secret's out,

591
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,583
I'm gonna have to remove him
from the altar boys.

592
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,125
That's what I was trying to avoid.

593
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,708
You were trying
to protect the boy.

594
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:17,667
That's right.

595
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:20,292
I might have done the same thing.

596
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,000
Is there a way Donald could stay
on the altar boys?

597
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:27,125
If the boy drank altar wine,
he can't continue as an altar boy.

598
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,625
Of course.

599
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:32,875
Are you satisfied?

600
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:34,583
Yes.

601
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:38,750
Hmm.

602
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,375
Well, I'll be going.
I have some writing to do.

603
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,875
- Intolerance.
- That's right.

604
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:51,458
I'm not pleased
with how you handled this.

605
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,167
Sister. Sister.

606
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:04,208
Well...

607
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:09,000
What a relief. He cleared it all up.

608
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:13,708
You believe him?

609
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:17,250
Of course.

610
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,375
Isn't it that it's easier to believe him?

611
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,917
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.

612
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,208
Mmm-hmm.

613
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,125
Yes.

614
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:32,292
These types of people are clever.

615
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:39,125
- Well, I'm convinced.
- You're not.

616
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:44,000
You just want things to be resolved
so you can have simplicity back.

617
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:47,333
I want no further part of this.

618
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,667
I'll bring him down.

619
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,250
How can you be so sure
that he is lying?

620
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:00,583
Experience.

621
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,208
You just don't like him.

622
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:09,292
You don't like it
that he uses a ballpoint pen.

623
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,917
You don't like it that he takes
three lumps of sugar in his tea.

624
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,167
<i>You don't like it
that he likes Frosty the Snowman,</i>

625
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:20,042
and you are letting that convince you
of something terrible, just terrible.

626
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,917
<i>Well, I like Frosty the Snowman!</i>

627
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,958
And I think it would be nice
if this school weren't run like a jail,

628
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,375
and I think it's a good thing
that I love to teach history

629
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,583
and that I might inspire my students
to love it, too.

630
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,667
And if you judge that to mean
that I am not fit to be a teacher,

631
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:36,292
then so be it!

632
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,333
Sit down.

633
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,125
Look at that. You blew out my light.

634
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:03,000
In ancient Sparta, important matters
were decided by who shouted loudest.

635
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:06,042
Fortunately,
we are not in ancient Sparta.

636
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:14,333
You honestly find the students
in this school

637
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:18,208
to be treated like inmates in a prison?

638
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:20,500
No.

639
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:26,333
Actually, they all seem fairly happy,
but they're all uniformly terrified of you.

640
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:31,083
Yes. That's how it works.

641
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:34,083
Sit there.

642
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,875
Hello, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier,

643
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,583
principal at St. Nicholas School.
Is this Mrs. Miller?

644
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,333
I'm calling about your son, Donald.

645
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:18,458
<i>A woman was gossiping with
a friend about a man she hardly knew.</i>

646
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:20,750
<i>I know none of you
have ever done this.</i>

647
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:25,000
<i>That night she had a dream.</i>

648
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:29,792
<i>A great hand appeared over her
and pointed down at her.</i>

649
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:35,750
<i>She was immediately seized
with an overwhelming sense of guilt.</i>

650
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,375
<i>The next day she went to confession.</i>

651
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,375
<i>She got the old parish priest,
Father O'Rourke.</i>

652
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,917
<i>She told him the whole thing.</i>

653
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:50,125
<i>"Is gossiping a sin?"
she asked the old man.</i>

654
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:55,417
<i>"Was that the hand of God Almighty
pointing a finger at me?</i>

655
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,167
<i>"Should I be
asking your absolution, Father?</i>

656
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:01,292
<i>"Tell me,
have I done something wrong?"</i>

657
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:05,625
<i>"Yes." Father O'Rourke answered her.</i>

658
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,708
<i>"Yes, you ignorant,
badly brought up female.</i>

659
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,667
<i>"You have borne false witness
against your neighbor.</i>

660
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:16,667
<i>"You have played fast and loose
with his reputation,</i>

661
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:19,417
<i>"and you should be heartily ashamed!"</i>

662
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:26,000
<i>So the woman said she was sorry
and asked for forgiveness.</i>

663
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:29,750
<i>"Not so fast," says O'Rourke.</i>

664
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:35,083
<i>"I want you to go home.
Take a pillow up on your roof,</i>

665
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,958
<i>"cut it open with a knife,
and return here to me."</i>

666
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:44,458
<i>So the woman went home,
took a pillow off her bed,</i>

667
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,542
<i>a knife from the drawer,</i>

668
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:50,500
<i>went up the fire escape to her roof
and stabbed the pillow.</i>

669
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:54,208
<i>Then she went back
to the old parish priest as instructed.</i>

670
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:58,375
<i>"Did you gut the pillow with a knife?"
he says.</i>

671
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,958
<i>"Yes, Father."
"And what was the result?"</i>

672
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:05,917
<i>"Feathers," she said.</i>

673
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:12,042
<i>"Feathers," he repeated.</i>

674
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,708
<i>"Feathers everywhere, Father."</i>

675
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:23,583
<i>"Now, I want you to go back</i>

676
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:27,583
<i>"and gather up every last feather
that flew out on the wind."</i>

677
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:32,625
<i>"Well," she said, "it can't be done.</i>

678
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:37,542
<i>"I don't know where they went.
The wind took them all over."</i>

679
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:43,792
<i>"And that," said Father O'Rourke,
"is gossip!"</i>

680
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:50,375
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

681
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,292
<i>Please rise.</i>

682
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:31,042
What's that bird complaining about?

683
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:35,458
What kind of bird is that?

684
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:38,458
That a starling? A grackle?

685
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,250
- A crow.
- Course it is.

686
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,833
Are you praying?
I didn't mean to interrupt.

687
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:49,792
I'm not praying. No.

688
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:53,500
You seem subdued.

689
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:57,542
Oh, I can't sleep.

690
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:00,083
Why not?

691
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,417
Bad dreams.

692
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:06,292
Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion.

693
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:11,000
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?

694
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:13,000
Yes. Sometimes.

695
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:19,625
Was your sermon
directed at anyone in particular?

696
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,625
What do you think?

697
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:38,875
I received a letter
from my brother in Maryland.

698
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,500
He's very sick.

699
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:45,750
Then maybe you should go
and see him.

700
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,875
I can't leave my class.

701
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,333
Is it true?

702
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:01,625
What?

703
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:05,250
You know what I'm asking.

704
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,542
No.

705
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:15,250
I saw you put an undershirt
in Donald Miller's locker.

706
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:21,625
- He left it in the sacristy.
- Why didn't you hand it to him?

707
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:28,417
I'm trying to spare him
further embarrassment.

708
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,333
It's me that cares about that child,
not her.

709
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:51,208
Has she ever reached out a hand?

710
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:56,667
That black boy needs help
or he's not gonna make it.

711
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,917
If she has her way,
he'll be left to his own undoing.

712
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:02,500
Why do you think he drank the wine?
He's in trouble.

713
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:08,042
And she sees me talk
in a human way to these kids

714
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:12,417
and she immediately assumes that
there must be something wrong with it.

715
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:16,417
Well, I'm not gonna let her
keep this parish in the Dark Ages,

716
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:20,000
and I'm not gonna let her
destroy my spirit of compassion.

717
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:21,667
I'm sure that's not her intent.

718
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:25,542
- That I care about this congregation.
- I know you do.

719
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:30,292
Like you care about your class.
You love them, don't you?

720
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:33,958
- Yes.
- And that's natural.

721
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:37,417
How else would you relate to children?

722
01:00:40,292 --> 01:00:43,833
Now, I can look at your face
and know your philosophy.

723
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,917
It's kindness.

724
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:49,833
I don't know. I mean, of course.

725
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:55,583
There are people
who go after your humanity, Sister,

726
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,792
that tell you that
the light in your heart is a weakness.

727
01:00:58,917 --> 01:01:00,625
Don't believe it.

728
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:06,833
It's an old tactic of cruel people
to kill kindness in the name of virtue.

729
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,667
There's nothing wrong with love.

730
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,583
Love?

731
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,583
Have you forgotten the message
of our Savior?

732
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:23,917
It's love of people.

733
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:36,333
I just feel
as if everything is upside down.

734
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:45,500
There are just times in life
when we feel lost. It happens.

735
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,125
And it's a bond.

736
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,250
- Flowers.
- Yeah.

737
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,750
To remind me of spring.

738
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,958
I should be going.

739
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:16,375
I'm sorry your brother's ill.

740
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,958
Thank you, Father.

741
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,792
I don't believe it.

742
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,250
You don't?

743
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,500
No.

744
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:38,833
Thank you, Sister.
Thank you very much.

745
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:51,833
Hey, Anthony!
That's not funny.

746
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:54,333
That's also the day
that I tripped. I broke my ankle.

747
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:55,500
I barely...

748
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:58,917
Father. I think
I've just gotta tell somebody.

749
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:01,292
- Hello, Noreen.
- I'm in love.

750
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:04,333
That's wonderful. Who's the lucky boy?

751
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,000
- Jimmy Hurley.
- Have you told him?

752
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,250
For life and death,
I'd go for waffles.

753
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,083
Maybe you should.

754
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,542
Maybe I will, Father.

755
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,375
Jimmy!

756
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:18,667
Jimmy Hurley?

757
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,917
Come over here!

758
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,542
Hurry up, already!

759
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:28,500
Father Sherman.

760
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,250
Jimmy,
I just gotta tell you something.

761
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,708
You dropped something.

762
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,083
It's not funny.

763
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,375
Get out of the way.

764
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,167
It's all right.

765
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,917
He doesn't like me.
That is so easy!

766
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:09,333
My parents are gonna be
so angry at me.

767
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:20,042
Okay. Be quiet.

768
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,042
I said be quiet!

769
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:30,333
The next one of you that speaks out
of turn gets sent right to the principal.

770
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,375
Now the question was,

771
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:35,958
what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

772
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,083
- Donald.
- Sister?

773
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:49,042
What was the question?

774
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:53,500
Nobody help him.
Jimmy, put your hand down.

775
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,458
Donald Miller, stand up.

776
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:05,500
- What was the question, Donald?
- I don't know, Sister.

777
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:09,417
It means you weren't listening.

778
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,333
Yes, Sister.

779
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:15,833
The question was, what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

780
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,375
I don't know.

781
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,875
"Give me liberty or give me death!"

782
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,750
James Hurley,
down to the principal's office.

783
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:27,000
Now!

784
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:53,333
- Mrs. Miller?
- Yes.

785
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:54,750
Come in.

786
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:58,542
Please, have a seat.

787
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,125
I was changing a bulb.

788
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:08,708
Thought I mighta had the wrong day.
You didn't answer.

789
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:09,792
Huh?

790
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:13,208
Oh, well, just between us,

791
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:18,417
I was listening to a transistor radio
with an earpiece.

792
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:20,750
Look how tiny they're making them.

793
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:22,917
I confiscated it
from one of the students,

794
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:24,750
now I can't stop listening to it.

795
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:27,250
You like music?

796
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,500
No. News reports.

797
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,583
Years ago I used to listen
to all the news reports,

798
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:37,792
because my husband was in Italy,
in the war.

799
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:40,750
- You were a married woman?
- Yes.

800
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,750
But then he was killed.

801
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:46,375
Is your husband coming?

802
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:49,167
Couldn't get off work.
I only have half an hour myself.

803
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:52,292
I see. Of course. It was a lot to ask.

804
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,583
How's Donald doing?

805
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:07,625
He's passing his subjects.
He has average grades.

806
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:10,167
Oh. Good.

807
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:13,458
He was upset about getting taken off
the altar boys.

808
01:07:13,542 --> 01:07:15,792
Mmm. Did he explain why?

809
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:18,750
He said he was caught
drinking altar wine.

810
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,708
That is the reason.

811
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,917
Well, that seems fair.

812
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,292
But he's a good boy, Sister.
He fell down there,

813
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:30,083
but he's a good boy
pretty much down the line.

814
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,958
How is he at home?

815
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:36,083
His father beat the hell out of him
over that wine.

816
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,583
Oh, he shouldn't do that.

817
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:41,500
You don't tell my husband what to do.
You just stand back.

818
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:45,333
My husband didn't want Donald
to come here.

819
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,583
- Why?
- He thought he'd have trouble

820
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:50,958
with the other boys,
but that hasn't really happened.

821
01:07:51,042 --> 01:07:52,292
Good.

822
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:56,167
That priest, Father Flynn,
been watching out for him.

823
01:07:58,542 --> 01:07:59,667
Yes.

824
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,458
Excuse me.

825
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:19,500
James Hurley,
what are you doing out of class?

826
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:21,667
- Sister James sent me down.
- What for?

827
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,625
- Talking.
- Well, go back up and shut up!

828
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,250
Go! Go!

829
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,333
What's going on?

830
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:41,625
None of your business.
Now go on. Go back to class.

831
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:43,958
Bullshit.

832
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:46,167
- What'd you say?
- Nothing!

833
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:54,292
You have 20 minutes, you say?

834
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,583
It's just that I have to walk to work.

835
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:01,083
- Where is work?
- Parkchester.

836
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:04,542
If I don't start cleaning by noon,
I'm not home to let Donald in.

837
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:07,833
- May I walk with you?
- I don't mind.

838
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,833
Eight sixty-fourths.

839
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:17,000
Who can tell me
what the common denominator is?

840
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:18,417
Nobody?

841
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:22,583
Back already, Mr. Hurley?

842
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,708
- I said, back already, Mr. Hurley?
- Leave me alone!

843
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:29,500
Who do you think you're talking to?

844
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:33,125
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.

845
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:38,833
I'm sorry.

846
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:48,000
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

847
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:54,000
Have you met
Father Flynn?

848
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:56,583
Just seen him on the altar.
Haven't met him face to face.

849
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:59,125
No, just, you know, heard from Donald.

850
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,583
And what does he say?

851
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:03,333
You know,
"Father Flynn, Father Flynn."

852
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:06,167
He looks up to him. Man gives him
his time, which is what the boy needs.

853
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:07,833
He needs that.

854
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:11,083
Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.

855
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,250
I thought there must a been a reason
you wanting to see me.

856
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:16,292
Principal's a big job.

857
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:20,333
I just want to say though,
it's just till June.

858
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,875
Excuse me?

859
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:27,458
Whatever the problem is,
Donald just has to make it till June.

860
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:29,917
Then he's off into high school.

861
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:31,250
Right.

862
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,708
If Donald can graduate
from St. Nicholas,

863
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,583
he has a better chance
of getting into a good high school,

864
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:39,833
and that would mean
an opportunity at college.

865
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,500
I don't see anything at this time

866
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:46,167
standing in the way
of his graduating with his class.

867
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:50,333
- Well, that's all I care about.
- I doubt that.

868
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,167
Try me.

869
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,792
I am concerned about the relationship
between Father Flynn and your son.

870
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:03,500
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?

871
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,667
That it may not be right.

872
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:08,833
Well, there's something wrong
with everybody,

873
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,500
and their soul gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.

874
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,792
I am concerned, to be frank,

875
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:22,958
that Father Flynn may have made
advances on your son.

876
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,792
May have made?

877
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:31,333
I can't be certain.

878
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:33,250
- No evidence?
- No.

879
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,917
Then maybe there's nothing to it.

880
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:46,917
I think there is something to it.

881
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:50,292
I think Father Flynn
gave Donald that altar wine.

882
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:52,292
Why would he do that?

883
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:58,833
- Has Donald been acting strangely?
- No.

884
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:01,375
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- He's been himself.

885
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,167
- All right.
- Look, Sister, I don't want any trouble.

886
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,583
I don't... I'm not sure
you completely understand.

887
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:08,625
I think I understand
the kind of thing you're talking about,

888
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,333
but I don't want to get into it.

889
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:12,917
What's that?

890
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:17,917
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,

891
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,833
but if we're talking about
something floating around

892
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:23,333
between this priest and my son,
it ain't my son's fault.

893
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:26,000
- I'm not suggesting that...
- He's just a boy.

894
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,333
- I know.
- Twelve years old.

895
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,000
If someone should be taking blame,
it should be the man...

896
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:31,167
- I know. I agree with you completely.
- ...not the boy.

897
01:12:31,292 --> 01:12:32,500
You're agreeing with me,
but I got called

898
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:33,792
to the principal,
if you know what I'm saying.

899
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:37,292
I am concerned about Donald's welfare.

900
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,500
You honestly think that priest
gave Donald that wine to drink?

901
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,000
Yes, I do.

902
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,500
Then how come my son
got kicked off the altar boys

903
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:47,667
- if it was a man that gave it to him?
- I know.

904
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:50,333
The boy got caught, the man didn't.

905
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:54,417
- So you're giving my son the blame.
- No.

906
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:55,500
No problem my son getting blamed,

907
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,500
- and you know why that is.
- Perhaps you should let me talk.

908
01:12:57,625 --> 01:12:59,708
- I think you're getting upset.
- Sister, you ain't going against

909
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,125
no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.

910
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:04,417
- And he's got your son.
- Let him have him then.

911
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:08,000
What?

912
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:12,042
It's just till June.

913
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,625
Do you know what you're saying?

914
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:19,917
Know more about it than you.

915
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:25,167
I believe this man is creating,

916
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:27,375
or may have already brought about,

917
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,917
an improper relationship
with your son.

918
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:31,500
I don't know.

919
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:33,375
I know I am right.

920
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,583
Why you gotta know something
like that for sure when you don't?

921
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,958
What kind of mother are you?

922
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,667
Excuse me, but you don't know enough
about life to say a thing like that, Sister.

923
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:48,833
I know enough.

924
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,833
You know the rules maybe,
but that don't cover it.

925
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,792
I know what I won't accept.

926
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:55,000
You accept what you gotta accept,
and you work with it.

927
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:56,208
This man is in my school.

928
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,417
Well, he's gotta be somewhere and

929
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,167
- maybe he's doing some good, too.
- He is after the boys!

930
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:02,583
Well, maybe some of them boys
want to get caught!

931
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:17,000
That's why his father beat him.

932
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:22,167
Not the wine.

933
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:32,458
What are you telling me?

934
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:39,583
I'm talking about the boy's nature now,

935
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
not anything he's done.

936
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:48,875
You can't hold a child responsible
for what God gave him to be.

937
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,542
I'm only interested in actions,
Mrs. Miller.

938
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:56,542
But then there's the boy's nature.

939
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:59,750
- Leave that out of it.
- Well, forget it then.

940
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:04,208
You're the one
forcing people to say things.

941
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,000
My boy came to your school

942
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:12,667
'cause they were gonna kill him
in the public school.

943
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:17,458
His father don't like him.

944
01:15:18,042 --> 01:15:21,042
He come to your school,
kids don't like him.

945
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:24,458
One man is good to him, this priest.

946
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:28,125
Then does a man
have his reasons, yes.

947
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:32,417
Everybody does.
You have your reasons,

948
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:36,750
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?

949
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,875
No.

950
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,417
I don't care why.

951
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:53,667
My son needs some man
to care about him

952
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:58,125
and to see him through
to where he wants to go.

953
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,458
And thank God this educated man

954
01:16:00,583 --> 01:16:03,542
with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.

955
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:06,333
- This will not do.
- It's just till June.

956
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:08,458
I'll throw your son out of this school.

957
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,750
And why would you do that
if it didn't start with him?

958
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:13,167
Because I will stop this.

959
01:16:13,292 --> 01:16:15,042
You'd hurt my son to get your way?

960
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:18,042
- It won't end with your son.
- Throw the priest out then.

961
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:22,250
- I am trying to do just that.
- Then what do you want from me?

962
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:31,250
Nothing.

963
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:37,250
As it turns out.

964
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:41,208
Please leave my son
out of this.

965
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,875
My husband will kill that child
over a thing like this.

966
01:17:02,542 --> 01:17:03,917
I will try.

967
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:15,292
I'm late.

968
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,292
Sister,

969
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:25,167
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.

970
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:30,292
I'll be standing with my son
and those who are good with my son.

971
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:34,292
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.

972
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,792
May I come in?

973
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,167
A third party would be required.

974
01:18:57,292 --> 01:19:00,208
Yeah. What was Donald's mother
doing here?

975
01:19:00,917 --> 01:19:03,417
- We were having a chat.
- About what?

976
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:05,000
A third party
would truly be required, Father.

977
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,875
No, Sister. No third party!

978
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,667
Me and you are due for a talk!

979
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:12,250
You have to stop
this campaign against me.

980
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:15,250
- You can stop it at any time.
- How?

981
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,500
Confess and resign.

982
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:18,917
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation!

983
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:22,250
Who keeps opening my window?

984
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:25,667
What are you doing in this school?

985
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:27,667
I'm trying to do good.

986
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:30,250
Even more to the point,

987
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:33,292
what are you doing in the priesthood?

988
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:37,625
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back.

989
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:39,833
- From what?
- Progressive education

990
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:41,125
and a welcoming church.

991
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,375
You can't distract me, Father.

992
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,958
This is not about my behavior,
it's about yours.

993
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:47,083
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.

994
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:50,417
- That's right. I have suspicions.
- Just leave that. It's not important.

995
01:19:50,542 --> 01:19:52,458
I will decide

996
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,375
what's important.

997
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,250
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?

998
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:05,583
You gave that boy wine,
and you let him take the blame.

999
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:08,625
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?

1000
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:11,125
All McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.

1001
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,417
He doesn't know
how he came to drink it.

1002
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,750
Did his mother
have something to add to that?

1003
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:16,958
No.

1004
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:21,583
- So that's it.
- I am not satisfied.

1005
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,458
Ask the boy then.

1006
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:26,750
- He'd protect you.
- Why would he do that?

1007
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:30,750
- Because you have seduced him.
- You're insane.

1008
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:33,333
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this child

1009
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,500
after giving him wine,
and nothing I say will change that.

1010
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:37,833
That's right.

1011
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,500
But this has nothing to do
with the wine.

1012
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:42,792
Not really. You've had a fundamental
mistrust of me before this incident.

1013
01:20:42,917 --> 01:20:46,708
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the lookout, wasn't it?

1014
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:48,083
That's true.

1015
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:50,417
- So you admit it!
- Certainly.

1016
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:53,167
Why?

1017
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,042
I know people.

1018
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,958
That's not good enough.

1019
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:02,875
- It won't have to be.
- How's that?

1020
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,625
You will tell me what you have done.

1021
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:09,000
Oh, I will.

1022
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:12,417
Out again.

1023
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:16,708
Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.

1024
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,333
So you talked to Sister James.

1025
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,583
Well, of course
you talked to Sister James.

1026
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,750
Did you know
Donald's father beats him?

1027
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,000
Yes.

1028
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,250
And might that not account
for the odd behavior

1029
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:32,125
Sister James noticed in the boy?

1030
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:33,708
It might.

1031
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,792
Then what is it? What?

1032
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,875
What did you hear?

1033
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,333
What did you see
that convinced you so thoroughly?

1034
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:45,750
What does it matter?

1035
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:50,958
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!

1036
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,750
Out this window,

1037
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:09,667
I saw you grab William London's wrist,

1038
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:13,625
and I saw him pull away.

1039
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:31,500
- Are you serious?
- I am.

1040
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:34,667
That's all?

1041
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:38,167
Yeah. That was all.

1042
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,458
That's nothing.

1043
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,792
- What are you doing now?
- I'm writing down what you say.

1044
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:53,500
It might be important when I have to
explain why you have to be removed.

1045
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,500
This morning before I spoke
with Mrs. Miller,

1046
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:06,000
I took the precaution
of calling your last parish.

1047
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:08,417
What did he say?

1048
01:23:09,292 --> 01:23:11,000
- Who?
- The pastor.

1049
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:16,667
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.

1050
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:20,333
You should have spoken to the pastor.

1051
01:23:21,542 --> 01:23:22,792
I spoke to a nun.

1052
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:25,333
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.

1053
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:28,333
The church is very clear. You're
supposed to go through the pastor.

1054
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:31,333
Why? You have an understanding,
you and he?

1055
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:34,458
No, you have no right to go rummaging
through my past!

1056
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,333
You have a history.

1057
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,167
This is your third parish in five years.

1058
01:23:39,292 --> 01:23:40,667
- Why?
- Call the pastor.

1059
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:43,500
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.

1060
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:46,417
- I'm not calling the pastor.
- I'm a good priest.

1061
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:49,583
Go after another child and
another child, until you are stopped.

1062
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:52,167
- What nun did you speak to?
- I won't say.

1063
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:55,250
- Yeah, I've not touched a child.
- You have!

1064
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:58,167
You haven't the slightest proof
of anything.

1065
01:23:58,292 --> 01:23:59,958
But I have my certainty.

1066
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:02,167
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish

1067
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:05,292
and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.

1068
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,833
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

1069
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:11,833
You have no right to act on your own!

1070
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:16,833
You have taken vows,
obedience being one!

1071
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:18,750
You answer to us!

1072
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:21,833
You have no right
to step outside the church!

1073
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,500
I will step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,

1074
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:27,417
though the door should shut
behind me!

1075
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:32,417
I will do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to hell!

1076
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:37,042
You should understand that,
or you will mistake me.

1077
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:43,292
Now, did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

1078
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:47,167
Have you never done anything wrong?

1079
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:50,000
- I have.
- No mortal sin?

1080
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:00,750
Yes.

1081
01:25:02,792 --> 01:25:03,917
And?

1082
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:10,333
I confessed it, Father.

1083
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:15,250
Then whatever I have done,

1084
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:19,250
I have left in the healing hands
of my confessor.

1085
01:25:20,542 --> 01:25:22,042
As have you.

1086
01:25:23,542 --> 01:25:25,250
We are the same.

1087
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:30,792
Mmm-mmm.

1088
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,833
No, we are not. We are not the same.

1089
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:49,125
A dog that bites is a dog that bites.

1090
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:54,375
Did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

1091
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:56,625
No.

1092
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:00,125
Mental reservations?

1093
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:02,458
No.

1094
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:06,917
You lie.

1095
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:12,167
Very well then.

1096
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:18,833
If you will not leave my office, I will.

1097
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,250
And once I go, I will not stop.

1098
01:26:31,375 --> 01:26:32,583
Wait.

1099
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:02,083
I can't say everything, you understand?

1100
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,167
There's things I can't say,

1101
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:11,167
even if you can't imagine
the explanation, Sister.

1102
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:17,458
Remember, there are things
beyond your knowledge.

1103
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:24,125
Even if you feel certainty,
it is an emotion, not a fact.

1104
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:31,000
You will request a transfer

1105
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:36,167
and take a leave of absence
until it's granted.

1106
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,917
You'd leave me nothing.

1107
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:44,292
It's Donald Miller who has nothing,

1108
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:47,458
and you took full advantage of that.

1109
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:51,458
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.

1110
01:27:52,542 --> 01:27:53,667
Why?

1111
01:27:57,208 --> 01:27:59,292
'Cause you smile at him?

1112
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:02,583
And you sympathize with him?

1113
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:06,667
And you talk to him
as if you were the same?

1114
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:12,667
You are a cheat.

1115
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,750
And that warm feeling you experienced

1116
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:24,667
when that boy looked at you with trust
was not the sensation of virtue.

1117
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:29,667
That could be got by any drunkard
with his tot of rum.

1118
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:33,583
I can fight you.

1119
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:35,792
You will lose.

1120
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:41,000
Where's your compassion?

1121
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:45,667
Nowhere you can get at it.

1122
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:52,167
Stay here. Compose yourself.

1123
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,458
You can use the phone if you'd like.

1124
01:28:57,875 --> 01:28:59,625
Good day, Father.

1125
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,167
I have no sympathy for you.

1126
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:18,833
I know you are invulnerable
to true regret.

1127
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:27,167
And cut your nails.

1128
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,667
<i>Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow</i>

1129
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:33,083
<i>Praise him all creatures here below</i>

1130
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:39,042
<i>Praise him above, ye heavenly host</i>

1131
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:45,583
<i>Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost</i>

1132
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,917
<i>Amen</i>

1133
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:02,167
<i>I never like to say goodbye,</i>

1134
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:10,333
<i>but there is a wind behind every one
of us that takes us through our lives.</i>

1135
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:16,583
<i>We never see it. We can't command it.</i>

1136
01:31:18,042 --> 01:31:20,458
<i>We don't even know its purpose.</i>

1137
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:25,917
<i>'Cause I would have stayed
among you longer,</i>

1138
01:31:26,042 --> 01:31:28,458
<i>but that wind is taking me away.</i>

1139
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:35,750
<i>I will miss it here,</i>

1140
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:39,167
<i>and I will miss you.</i>

1141
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
<i>But I'm content that the power
that propels me</i>

1142
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:49,292
<i>does so with superior knowledge</i>

1143
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:52,500
<i>as to what is for the best,</i>

1144
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:56,792
<i>and that is my faith.</i>

1145
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,958
<i>I would like to come down now
among you</i>

1146
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:06,333
<i>and say goodbye</i>

1147
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:10,167
<i>and wish you peaceful hearts</i>

1148
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:12,583
<i>and loving hearts.</i>

1149
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:25,458
- Goodbye, Senator.
- Father.

1150
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,250
Carol. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1151
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:30,000
Bless you, Father.

1152
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:33,750
- Happy holidays. Susan. Bless you.
- Thank you, Father.

1153
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:36,417
- Father.
- Thank you.

1154
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:38,958
Be good. Thank you.

1155
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:43,000
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

1156
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,667
Paul. Thank you so much.

1157
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:52,375
God bless you. Goodbye.

1158
01:33:32,542 --> 01:33:34,667
<i>...a midnight clear</i>

1159
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:38,917
<i>A glorious song of old</i>

1160
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:44,000
<i>From angels bending near the Earth</i>

1161
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:10,917
Sister James. Welcome back.

1162
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:12,417
Thank you, Sister.

1163
01:34:12,542 --> 01:34:15,167
You were missed. How is your brother?

1164
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:17,500
Better. Much better.

1165
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:20,667
I'm very glad. I prayed for him.

1166
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,167
It was good to get away.
I needed to see my family.

1167
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:28,667
Mmm. Then I'm glad you did it.

1168
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,167
And Father Flynn is gone?

1169
01:34:35,542 --> 01:34:36,667
Yes.

1170
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:42,000
So you did it. You got him out.

1171
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:43,833
Yes.

1172
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:49,167
Donald Miller is heartbroken.

1173
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:53,208
Can't be helped. It's just till June.

1174
01:34:57,292 --> 01:35:00,417
I don't think Father Flynn
did anything wrong.

1175
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:03,250
No? He convinced you?

1176
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:05,542
- Yes, he did.
- Mmm.

1177
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,333
Did you ever prove it?

1178
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:18,167
- To whom?
- Anyone but yourself?

1179
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,667
Nope.

1180
01:35:21,167 --> 01:35:23,667
- But you were sure?
- Yes.

1181
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:30,417
I wish I could be like you.

1182
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:33,583
Why?

1183
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:37,500
Because I can't sleep anymore.

1184
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:44,958
Maybe we're not supposed to
sleep so well.

1185
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,917
They made Father Flynn
pastor of Saint Jerome.

1186
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:56,417
- Who?
- The bishop.

1187
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:04,250
Appointed Father Flynn pastor
of Saint Jerome Church and School.

1188
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,500
It's a promotion.

1189
01:36:08,958 --> 01:36:10,583
You didn't tell them?

1190
01:36:10,708 --> 01:36:15,542
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.

1191
01:36:19,042 --> 01:36:21,583
He did not believe it to be true.

1192
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:28,125
Then why did Father Flynn go?

1193
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:30,833
What did you say to make him leave?

1194
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,667
That I had called a nun
in his previous parish,

1195
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:40,750
that I had found out
his prior history of infringements.

1196
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:47,833
So you did prove it?

1197
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:54,167
I made no such call.

1198
01:36:58,375 --> 01:37:01,250
- You lied?
- Yes.

1199
01:37:02,542 --> 01:37:07,292
But if he'd had no such history,
the lie wouldn't have worked.

1200
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:13,417
His resignation was his confession.

1201
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,833
He was what I thought he was.

1202
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,417
And he's gone.

1203
01:37:30,292 --> 01:37:32,333
I can't believe you lied.

1204
01:37:38,208 --> 01:37:40,458
In the pursuit of wrongdoing,

1205
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,958
one steps away from God.

1206
01:37:47,667 --> 01:37:49,917
Of course, there is a price.

1207
01:37:58,458 --> 01:37:59,625
I see.

1208
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:09,542
Oh.

1209
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:11,667
Sister James.

1210
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:14,833
What is it, Sister?

1211
01:38:21,125 --> 01:38:23,083
I have doubts.

1212
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:34,000
I have such doubts.

1213
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:29,167
<i>Come, thou,
redeemer of the Earth</i>

1214
01:39:29,542 --> 01:39:36,292
<i>And manifest thy virgin birth</i>

1215
01:39:36,542 --> 01:39:43,250
<i>Let every age adoring fall</i>

1216
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:50,417
<i>Such birth befits the God of all</i>

1217
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:58,625
<i>Begotten of no human will</i>

1218
01:39:59,042 --> 01:40:05,542
<i>But of the Spirit, thou art still</i>

1219
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:13,000
<i>The word of God in flesh arrayed</i>

1220
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:20,333
<i>The promised fruit to man displayed</i>

1221
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:29,083
<i>The virgin womb that burden gained</i>

1222
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:35,875
<i>With virgin honor all unstained</i>

1223
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:43,167
<i>The banners there of virtue glow</i>

1224
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:50,500
<i>God in his temple dwells below</i>

1225
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:59,875
<i>Forth from his chamber goeth he</i>

1226
01:41:00,292 --> 01:41:07,125
<i>That royal home of purity</i>

1227
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:14,500
<i>A giant in twofold substance one</i>

1228
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:21,917
<i>Rejoicing now his course to run</i>

1229
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:31,042
<i>From God the Father he proceeds</i>

1230
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:38,333
<i>To God the Father back he speeds</i>

1231
01:41:38,917 --> 01:41:45,875
<i>His course he runs to death and hell</i>

1232
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:53,208
<i>Returning on God's throne to dwell</i>

1233
01:41:55,708 --> 01:42:02,583
<i>O equal to thy Father, thou</i>

1234
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:09,500
<i>Gird on thy fleshly mantle now</i>

1235
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:16,875
<i>The weakness of our mortal state</i>

1236
01:42:17,417 --> 01:42:24,375
<i>With deathless might invigorate</i>

1237
01:42:27,042 --> 01:42:33,875
<i>Thy cradle here shall glitter bright</i>

1238
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:41,167
<i>And darkness breathe a newer light</i>

1239
01:42:41,542 --> 01:42:48,500
<i>Where endless faith shall shine serene</i>

1240
01:42:48,708 --> 01:42:55,625
<i>And twilight never intervene</i>

1241
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:04,917
<i>All praise, eternal Son, to thee</i>

1242
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:12,333
<i>Whose advent sets thy people free</i>

1243
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:19,250
<i>Whom, with the Father, we adore</i>

1244
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:26,708
<i>And Holy Ghost for evermore</i>

1245
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:36,167
<i>Amen</i>

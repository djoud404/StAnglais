1
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,853
<i>In 1917, I signed up
to fight the Huns in France.</i>

2
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,004
<i>Good men died ail around me.</i>

3
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,834
<i>And I saw no reason for it.</i>

4
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,448
<i>The rules we lived by were lies.</i>

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,688
<i>And the y didn't apply
to those who made them.</i>

6
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,091
<i>1 swore if 1 made it home,
I would never follow orders again.</i>

7
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:28,361
<i>I left a soldier.</i>

8
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,795
<i>I came home an outlaw.</i>

9
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,748
<i>I lived one robbery to the next.</i>

10
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,049
<i>A good day was filled by sleep,</i>

11
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,621
<i>and a good night spent
running too hard to look back.</i>

12
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:01,096
<i>I lived that life for 10 years
until it caught up to me.</i>

13
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,097
<i>It all started with an inside man.</i>

14
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,911
<i>The Albert White crew
was playing a high stakes poker game,</i>

15
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:25,420
<i>and our inside man
left the back door open for us.</i>

16
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,427
Three, two, one.

17
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,997
Give us the fucking money.

18
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,533
- Do you know whose fucking place this is?
- Give it!

19
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,502
I asked, "Do you know whose fucking card
game this is", you fucking dunce?

20
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:43,269
- You heard of Albert White?
- Keep talking, bimbo.

21
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,057
Miss, come here. Come here!

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,219
Do you want a drink
to go with your robbery?

23
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,848
No. Just the money. Put it in the bag.

24
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:53,846
Let's go. In the bag. Right here.
Nice and easy.

25
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,788
What's your name'?

26
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,015
Emma Gould. What's yours?

27
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,325
- You're gonna put a sock in my mouth?
- That's right.

28
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,795
A sock? In my mouth'?

29
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,693
Never been used before,
and I wouldn't lie to you.

30
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,300
That's what all the liars say.

31
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,959
Quick, open up.

32
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:16,667
Just do a quick...

33
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,967
Watch this guy.

34
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,405
Here we go.

35
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,512
Hey, put your fucking hands
on the table.

36
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,703
Great.

37
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,373
All right, boys. Let's go.

38
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,651
You've got some balls.

39
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,991
Just slow down
and stop driving like we did something.

40
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,256
Relax.

41
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,829
We made out pretty good.
It was a nice hit.

42
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,521
Yeah, it's all mine.

43
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:42,927
<i>Yeah. It's a living.</i>

44
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,366
- Yeah, you fucking Mick.
- Get the fuck out of here. Drive the car.

45
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,445
Good afternoon-I'm Albert White-

46
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,444
You must be Joe.

47
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,009
Coughlin.

48
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:06,520
Good to put a face to the name.

49
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,748
This is Brennan Loomis, friend of mine.

50
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:09,949
How are you'!

51
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:16,461
You're too smart
for the stuff you've been pulling.

52
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,600
Nickel and diming with two dumb Guineas.

53
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,230
They're your friends,
but they're stupid and they're wops.

54
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,204
And they won't live to see 40.

55
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,913
Take your time.

56
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:34,548
But you can't work on your own.

57
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,887
Not in this town.

58
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,213
<i>Albert was rounding up the troops.</i>

59
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,754
<i>There was a war going on over rum.</i>

60
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,555
Dermot, go and have a word.

61
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,495
<i>Albert White ran the Irish mob...</i>

62
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:51,761
Brennan, keep an eye on him.

63
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,831
Uh-huh.

64
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,098
<i>And Maso Pescatore ran the Italians.</i>

65
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,807
<i>It was tit for tat.</i>

66
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,783
<i>The deadliest year
in the history of Boston.</i>

67
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:18,620
<i>White's gang set fire to rum trucks.</i>

68
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,526
<i>Then a guy on Maso's payroll</i>

69
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,463
<i>went home with a girl
no one had seen before.</i>

70
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,937
<i>No winner. Just a lot of mess.</i>

71
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,446
<i>I wanted nothing to do
with Albert White and his war.</i>

72
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,622
<i>But I didn't have a choice.</i>

73
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,824
<i>His girlfriend was my inside man.</i>

74
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,560
<i>And I was in love with her.</i>

75
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:13,041
<i>He'd kill her if she tried to leave him'</i>

76
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,518
<i>and he'd kill us both 10 times over
if he found out we were together.</i>

77
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,923
<i>But we were in love and we were stupid.</i>

78
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,394
<i>And every time he was out of town,
we were together.</i>

79
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,096
<i>The fit was perfect.</i>

80
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,906
get revenge on me,
when I least expect it.

81
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,971
- You just keep saying stupid things.
- No, I don't.

82
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,043
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,134
<i>I know what you like to hear
'cause I'm no fool.</i>

84
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,295
Like a book.

85
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,624
Mind if I join you'!

86
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:03,233
Sorry, Father Time,
we're waiting for someone.

87
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,391
No.

88
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,369
Emma, this is my father, Tom Coughlin.

89
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,302
Dad, this is my friend, Emma Gould.

90
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,704
<i>Pleasure, Miss Gould.</i>

91
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,970
Mind if I sit down'?

92
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,250
Where are you from, Miss Gould?

93
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,821
Dorchester.

94
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,221
No, I meant before.
You're clearly Irish.

95
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,882
All my mother's people are from Cork.

96
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,052
Really? What's her maiden name'!

97
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,663
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

98
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,062
She died. She's dead, my mum, so...

99
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,470
So, what is it you do?

100
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,903
It's a real swank place, this, isn't it'?

101
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,742
I'm aware of how my son earns a living.

102
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,317
I can only assume that
if you've come into contact with him,

103
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,350
it was either during a crime,

104
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,012
or in an establishment
populated by rough characters.

105
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,853
Are my questions
making you feel uncomfortable?

106
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,122
I don't know what you're on about.

107
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,596
And to be honest, I don't really care.

108
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,134
I'm on about you being the type of
lassie who consorts with criminals.

109
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,266
<i>The fact that the criminal is my son
isn't the issue.</i>

110
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,807
It is that my son is still my son.

111
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,946
<i>And I have feelings that cause me</i>

112
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,446
to question the wisdom
of consorting with the type of woman

113
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:27,106
who knowingly consorts with criminals.

114
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,545
- Did you follow all that?
- Enough, Dad. Enough. Okay?

115
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,681
My uncle mentioned a copper
on his payroll, name of Coughlin.

116
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,119
Is that you'?

117
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,828
This uncle would be your Uncle Robert?

118
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,190
Who everyone knows as "Bobo"?

119
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,301
No, the police officer you refer to
is Elmore Conklin.

120
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,463
He's stationed in Savin Hill.

121
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,378
<i>He collects shakedowns from
illegal establishments such as Bobo's.</i>

122
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,715
<i>I rarely get over to Dorchester.</i>

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,178
Still, as deputy superintendent,

124
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,751
I'd be happy to take
a greater interest in Bobo.

125
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,990
I need to powder.

126
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,157
Was that necessary?

127
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,200
I didn't start the fight, Joseph.

128
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,498
So, don't criticize me
for how I finished it.

129
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,736
I've been a police officer for 37 years.

130
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,674
If I've learned one thing above all,
do you know what it is'?

131
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,780
This gonna be another yarn
from the old country?

132
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,040
No.

133
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:36,210
What you put out in the world
will always come back to you.

134
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,548
But never how you predict.

135
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,588
I'm sure it doesn't.

136
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,924
Unearned confidence
of that about which one is ignorant,

137
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,620
always has the brightest glow.

138
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,855
I think I've earned enough.

139
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,129
She's quite easy on the eyes.

140
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,936
Yeah, she is.

141
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,106
Apart from that,
I fail to grasp what you see in her.

142
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:00,767
Because she's from Dorchester?

143
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,211
That doesn't help. Her father's a pimp.
Her uncle killed two men.

144
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,248
But I could overlook all that,
Joseph, if she wasn't...

145
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,750
She just doesn't pretend
to be something she's not.

146
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,154
Maybe she's just asleep.

147
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,789
Thanks for stopping by.

148
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,360
Maybe you should
climb under his covers tonight.

149
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,384
What?

150
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,054
He looks at me like I'm trash.

151
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:26,134
We're not people.
We're just the Goulds from Dorchester.

152
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,499
We tat the lace for your fucking curtains.

153
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,403
- Jesus! You know what...
- Don't fucking touch me.

154
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,172
My whole life,
I got the high hat and the icy mitt

155
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,573
from people like your father.

156
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,274
We're not less than you.

157
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,815
I never said you were.

158
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,280
Well, he did.

159
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,854
Fuck him, okay? I love you.

160
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,960
You think love's so easy.

161
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,528
It can be.

162
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:57,624
on, God.

163
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,096
- Come here.
- I don't want to.

164
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,261
Leave me alone!

165
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,875
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

166
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,013
- I want to go.
- Okay.

167
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,506
Okay.

168
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,779
Can you spare two bits?

169
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,791
Thanks a lot.

170
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,958
Joe Coughlin. I got an invitation.

171
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,395
Put your arms up there. I gotta check you.

172
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
Go ahead.

173
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,514
Joseph?

174
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,014
Joe Coughlin. Yeah.

175
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,547
Pleasure.

176
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,489
Do you know who I am'?

177
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,659
I know enough to show up here
when I'm asked.

178
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,557
My name is Maso Pescatore.

179
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,865
I run the North End

180
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,227
and liquor coming up from Florida.

181
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,666
I'ma man, uh,

182
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,573
with the power
of other men's lives in my hands.

183
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,373
But the truth is, uh,

184
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,442
I'm just a simple wop
from the old country.

185
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,784
Today, my only true rival is Albert White.

186
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,625
When that is no longer the case,

187
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:35,197
we can see an end to the fighting
that has plagued this town.

188
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,529
Well, I got no beef with you.

189
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,706
<i>But I don't truck with gangsters.</i>

190
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,631
Not even a Sheik like you.

191
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,235
You do soup jobs and stickups,

192
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,383
but you're not a gangster.

193
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,312
- What does that make you?
- I don't know.

194
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:58,286
An outlaw, I guess.
I just don't want any part of that life.

195
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,821
How many things, good or bad,

196
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,160
come to us
whether we ask for them, or not?

197
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,592
For example, one of my men
saw you with a young lady.

198
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,759
Well, not so much a lady,
but a Bobo's moll

199
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,732
whose daddy's Albert White.

200
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,509
<i>So, it no longer matters
so much what you want.</i>

201
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,980
You're in this life,

202
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,282
<i>and it can only end two ways.</i>

203
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,014
<i>One, you get to Albert
and put an end to him.</i>

204
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,350
<i>Two,</i>

205
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,427
I tell Albert about the girl.

206
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,096
And he gets to you first.

207
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:46,433
Like I said, I ain't a gangster.

208
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,134
And I done enough killing in this life.

209
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,369
You wanna tell your enemy
some rumor you heard'? Go ahead.

210
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,769
<i>If I kill Albert White,</i>

211
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,974
somebody's just gonna jump up
and take his place.

212
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,144
And I'd be married to the
Pescatore mob for the rest of my life.

213
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,823
I stopped kissing rings a long time ago.

214
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,620
Good afternoon.

215
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,033
<i>Do you think he told Albert?</i>

216
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:24,639
Nah. I'd be dead already.

217
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,037
Christ.

218
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,974
We could leave.

219
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,043
Where would we go'?

220
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,645
Somewhere warm.

221
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,152
My brother, Danny, lives in California.

222
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:39,917
Where'?

223
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,192
I don't know.
I haven't talked to him in 10 years.

224
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:45,226
He sent back a bunch of postcards
saying he was doing stunts,

225
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,091
trying to be a writer.

226
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,994
God, I'd go to California.

227
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,658
I don't know much about honest work,
I gotta tell ya.

228
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,735
- Who said anything about honest work?
- Good.

229
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,338
No, we do what we wanna do.

230
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,667
We'll go where we wanna go.

231
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,711
Sleep by day-

232
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,049
I got a job in Lawrence on Saturday.

233
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,748
And then I'll be free.

234
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:11,910
Free to leave?

235
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,614
Yeah. Free to leave.

236
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,788
I have to see you-know-who on Saturday.

237
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,554
- Fuck you-know-who.
- That's the idea.

238
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,995
Oh, come on. What's the alternative?

239
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,592
You want me to end up in the Charles?

240
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,375
I'm supposed to meet him
at the Statler on Saturday.

241
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,543
Turns him on to see me
when his wife's on his arm.

242
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,042
After that,
he's going to Detroit for a week.

243
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,549
Can you clean yourself up
and get to the Statler by 7:00?

244
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,384
I think I can clean
myself up and get to the Statler by 7:00.

245
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,548
- $hut up!

246
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:56,759
<i>The Lawrence bank job would net us
enough to get to California on.</i>

247
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,134
<i>It's true
that's what I was thinking about.</i>

248
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,673
Let's go.

249
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,778
What are you doing?

250
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,912
Copper. Copper!

251
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,264
Whoa, look out! Look out!

252
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,894
Fuck!

253
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,106
Get out of the way!

254
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,274
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

255
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,014
- Oh, fuck!
- Shit!

256
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:00,285
Move! Get out of the fucking way!
Get out of the way!

257
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,394
Cop!

258
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,910
- All right, get out. Let's go.
- Go, go, go!

259
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,169
Get in the car! Go!

260
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:18,763
Shit!

261
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,368
<i>I walked half a mite,
stole a car in North Reading,</i>

262
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,378
<i>and replaced it with a Dodge
I found in Somerville.</i>

263
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,247
<i>I came back to my childhood home
and considered my options.</i>

264
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,151
<i>The story was in all the late editions.</i>

265
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,824
<i>The third dead cop was a trooper</i>

266
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,863
<i>who pulled someone over
near the state forest.</i>

267
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,094
<i>Had to be Dion.</i>

268
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,253
- Keep going.
- There's a service elevator up here.

269
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,823
I can't believe you came!

270
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,788
- What was I gonna do?
- Run.

271
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,709
- Where?
- I don't know. It's what people do.

272
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,092
It's not what I do.

273
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,935
Come on.

274
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,765
Shit! Shit! Shit!

275
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,016
Why are you crying?

276
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,015
Because I love you.

277
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,318
Then smile.

278
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,322
I can't.

279
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:34,787
No.

280
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,354
I'm sure as you die,
you'll tell yourself you did it for love.

281
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:34,515
No.

282
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,894
You feel guilty about what you do,

283
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,726
so, you spend your life hoping someone
will punish you for your sins.

284
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,366
<i>Well,</i>

285
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,865
here I am.

286
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,096
Joe, I'm so sorry.

287
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:52,230
She's sorry.

288
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,378
We're all fucking sorry.
Take her out of here.

289
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,208
You said you wouldn't kill him.
Albert, that was the deal.

290
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,873
- Don't worry.
- I would never have brought him here...

291
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:08,221
You think I'm going
to be humiliated by a whore?

292
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,057
<i>Someone comes to me</i>

293
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:13,719
says some arsehole
is putting horns on my fucking head.

294
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:19,559
You're lucky I didn't cut your tits off
and throw you in the fucking dump.

295
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,798
- Take her to the car, Donnie.
- No!

296
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,240
Joe, I'm sorry!

297
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:28,570
Albert, don't kill her.

298
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,237
You should be more worried about
what I'm going to do to you.

299
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,575
Albert, don't kill her.

300
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,979
Fuck do you care?
She just sold you down the river.

301
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,278
Please.

302
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,281
<i>I wasn't honest.</i>

303
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,188
I said if she delivered you to us,
I wouldn't kill you.

304
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,592
But we both know
I have to kill you, don't we, Joe?

305
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:47,853
And then,

306
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,697
I'm going to kill her, too.

307
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:02,166
Leave him.

308
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:03,837
Let's get out of here.

309
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,819
So, you're a cop killer now, Joseph?

310
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:19,962
I didn't kill anybody.

311
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:24,130
Looks like your friends were
about to take you on the dead man's drive.

312
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,894
Dad, they're gonna kill her.

313
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,834
<i>Well, we won't kill you, Joseph.</i>

314
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,336
But some of my coworkers
would like a word.

315
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,979
Listen, please. Dad!

316
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,647
<i>They're gonna kill her.</i>

317
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,548
She's in the car with Donnie Gishler.

318
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,915
<i>I don't know what his skull's
made of, but it isn't bone.</i>

319
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,663
In a coma two weeks.

320
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,172
No cranial bleeding.
No loss of memory or speech disability.

321
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:07,537
His nose and half his ribs are broken.

322
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,737
It'll be a long time before he doesn't see
any blood in the bowl. Go on in.

323
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:18,082
Dad, where is she'?

324
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,421
Did they find her'?

325
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,025
We followed her and Donnie Gishler.

326
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:27,186
His car went off the road
and into the ocean at 9:20.

327
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,692
An officer from Beverly
dove in looking for them.

328
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,962
Ended up in the hospital
for a week with hypothermia.

329
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,570
She was Albert White's girl.

330
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,269
She betrayed you.

331
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,544
She did.

332
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,272
And'?

333
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,884
I'm crazy about her.

334
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,052
Crazy isn't love.

335
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:54,048
I saw your marriage for 18 years.
It wasn't love.

336
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,951
No. No, it wasn't.

337
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,998
Either way, she's gone.

338
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,566
<i>She's as dead as your mother.
God rest her.</i>

339
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,230
They caught up with Paulo in St. Albans
about 10 miles from the border.

340
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:15,309
A number of officers gave chase.

341
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,173
He was struck by at least 14 rounds.

342
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,316
Low fora cop killer.

343
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,584
What about Dion?

344
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,086
It's possible he made the border.

345
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,031
You were the child that
was supposed to fix the distance

346
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,676
between me and your mother.

347
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,471
Were you aware of that?

348
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,481
I was aware of the distance.

349
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,978
People don't fix each other.

350
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:03,020
And they never become anything
but what they've always been.

351
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,892
All we get sometimes is a little luck.

352
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,801
Don't waste yours pining for a dead girl.

353
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,164
You make your own luck.

354
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,634
Sometimes.

355
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,131
Sometimes, it makes you.

356
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,853
<i>If he pleads guilty,</i>

357
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,852
<i>I can take the death penalty
off the table.</i>

358
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,663
Three years served, 20 probation.

359
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,832
Three years?
There are three dead police officers.

360
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,402
And he didn't kill them.

361
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:54,209
He may be the son
of a deputy superintendent,

362
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,836
but he will long know the inside
of the Charles town prison, I promise you.

363
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,209
Chief inspector.

364
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,180
I was demoted yesterday.

365
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,845
Then we can leave unsaid,
the notion I was going to dispel for you.

366
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,055
I have no illusions. I'm a practical man.

367
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,964
The photograph is of a door
to a row house in Back Bay,

368
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,897
where you have been keeping time
with a young man of Mexican descent.

369
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:22,595
<i>If you move the location of your liaisons,</i>

370
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,807
I will know within the hour.

371
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,045
Let me see what I can do.

372
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:39,044
Seeing what you can do
is of little interest to me.

373
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,765
<i>I plead guilty
to abetting armed robbery,</i>

374
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:58,896
<i>and was given three years and four months
in the Charles town prison.</i>

375
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:33,305
<i>If my father had lived two more weeks,</i>

376
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:37,502
<i>I could have said goodbye.</i>

377
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:28,025
<i>I got one guaranteed life,</i>

378
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,161
<i>and I was gonna live it.</i>

379
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:38,531
<i>I would use Maso and his haired for Albert
to get me started.</i>

380
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,840
Funny how things change.

381
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,537
What happened to all the talk
about not being a gangster?

382
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,509
Now, you come to me, looking for a job.

383
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,847
I got nothing left.
I don't wanna be a gangster.

384
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:55,180
But I'll work for one
if I can get to Albert White.

385
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:59,551
From what I heard in prison,
you're still the man to see about that.

386
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:02,961
We ran Albert White out of Boston,
like 'you heard.

387
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,737
<i>Now, he's making a run
to our rum operation in Central Florida.</i>

388
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,566
He wants Tampa.

389
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,071
It's true, I could use someone

390
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,732
who is committed
to putting an end to Mr. White.

391
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,742
Then you've found your man right here.

392
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,575
Your duty would always have to be

393
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,876
to the Pescatore family first,
and yourself second.

394
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,314
<i>You five with that?</i>

395
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,714
Sounds fair.

396
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,220
I just need one guy,
Dion Bartolo from my old crew

397
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,881
to help me go down there and setup.

398
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,549
It's good to have someone you can trust.

399
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,393
It's hot down there.

400
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:38,829
I don't mind hot.

401
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,230
You ain't never felt hot like this hot.

402
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:44,670
I spent some winters in Charles town.
I could use a change.

403
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,505
And get the narcotics running.
Starting in Tampa.

404
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,740
Frank Ormino runs Tampa.

405
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,903
He's gonna decide
he doesn't need the headache.

406
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,842
When's he gonna decide that?

407
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,848
Ten minutes after you get there.

408
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,077
I see.

409
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,886
Is that gonna make
me and you equal partners?

410
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,945
No.

411
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,022
Frank Ormino's an equal partner.

412
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,593
But look what's gonna happen to him.

413
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:08,630
I guess I work cheap.

414
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,922
Can you tolerate an Irishman in your crew?

415
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,502
This is America. I've lived with worse.

416
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,552
<i>I realized
it's not enough to break the rules.</i>

417
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:38,217
<i>You have to be strong enough
to make your own.</i>

418
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,035
Hi! Hi!

419
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,980
Joseph! Ah!

420
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,047
How you doing?

421
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,693
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

422
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,829
Hey, sorry about your father.

423
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,327
Yeah, sorry about your brother.

424
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,260
Thank you. Hey, thank you.

425
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,923
Listen, when Lefty Downer
found me in Montreal

426
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,934
and told me the Pescatores
wanted me to come work for them,

427
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:24,197
I thought it was a straight bamboozle.

428
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,601
Then I thought,

429
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:28,574
if anyone could charm the devil,
it's my old partner.

430
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,610
- Look at this.
- Holy shit!

431
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,543
Would you look at this?

432
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,012
Here. After you.

433
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,378
Get the fuck out of here.

434
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,577
I work for you now. Boss Joe Coughlin.

435
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:42,190
Reach under the seat,
and you'll find a friend.

436
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,190
Welcome to Ybor,
the Harlem of Tampa.

437
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,233
Cigars built this place.

438
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:57,931
What you're smelling now
is probably bolus or empanadas.

439
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,597
<i>The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone.</i>

440
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:03,110
As far as they're concerned,
we're a bunch of dirty spics and wops

441
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,844
and we can fuck off
and do what we need to do

442
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,108
as long as we leave them alone.

443
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:10,414
You'd think we all get along,
but it don't work out that way.

444
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,119
The Italians and the Cubans
keep to themselves.

445
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,483
But the Cubans, they hate the Spaniards,

446
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,128
and the Spaniards look at all Cubans
like they're uppity coons

447
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,490
who forgot their place
since America freed them in '98.

448
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:25,795
The Cubans and the Spanish,
they look down on the Puerto Ricans

449
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:28,733
and everyone, I mean, everyone,
shits on the Dominicans.

450
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,237
The Italians only respect you
if you came off the boat.

451
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,396
How you doing, ladies?

452
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,067
And the white people think
anyone gives a shit what they think.

453
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,472
You're a fucking piece of work.

454
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:56,025
Port of Tampa.

455
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,101
<i>Who is it?</i>

456
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,605
Fireplace.

457
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:17,646
Thanks, JT. Good work.

458
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,882
There's a whole network
of tunnels like this under the city.

459
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,353
- Who owns this warehouse?
- Frank Ormino did.

460
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,121
What do you mean Ormino "did"?

461
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,856
Ormino sprung a few leaks the other day.

462
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,726
That was quick.

463
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,067
Look at this over here.
Best money can buy!

464
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:41,641
You gotta keep it ai 186 Fahrenheit.

465
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,576
Yeah, these babies never lie.

466
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,876
Like to keep people from dying
when they drink your hooch.

467
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,677
We made a lot of toilet booze in prison.

468
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,980
Looks to me like
you're missing two key ingredients.

469
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,418
- Which are?
- People and molasses.

470
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,853
Yeah, we got a problem.

471
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,755
What?
- Our distributor.

472
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,588
He's been coming up empty.

473
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,061
- What is it?
- Boats have been sinking.

474
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,427
- What's his name?
- Gary L. Smith.

475
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:06,262
- Gary Ellsmith.
- No.

476
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:09,666
Gary L. Smith. it's a middle initial.

477
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,239
I don't know. He wants people to use it.
It's a Southern thing.

478
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:13,867
Not just an asshole thing?

479
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,436
Both.

480
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,005
Thank you, Miss Roe.

481
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,208
<i>You must be Maso's new find.</i>

482
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,353
I guess something like that.

483
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,849
- How you doing?
- All right.

484
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,121
So, what brings you by?

485
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,193
I've been asked to take over
Frank Ormino's affairs.

486
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,353
I hope that's not permanent.

487
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,195
- No offense.
- None taken. Why is that?

488
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,797
Folks like dealing with who they know.
And nobody knows you.

489
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,909
I see. Well, who would you suggest?

490
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,545
I have no ambitions for it,

491
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:53,376
but to keep continuity,
I might consider doing it fora term.

492
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:56,246
We're mostly concerned with why
the last three supply runs were hit.

493
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,646
That's the Cubans.

494
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,353
Why don't you just go to a new supplier?

495
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,152
- Not that simple.
- Why not'?

496
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,753
Because they're all
paying tribute to the Suarez family.

497
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,028
That's the Cubans
who own that club down on 7th, right?

498
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:10,572
We're gonna need to talk to them, too.

499
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,635
Uh...

500
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:17,434
I'm afraid you don't understand
how things are done here.

501
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:21,739
I deal with Mr. Suarez and his sister.

502
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,083
Okay, I'm sure we can arrange a table
for tomorrow night about 9:00.

503
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,242
Great.

504
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,686
Now, Gary L., tell me this.
Do you work directly for Albert White?

505
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,759
Or is there some intermediary
I should know about, as well?

506
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,952
What?
- We marked your bottles.

507
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,099
- You what?
- If you distilled it, we marked it.

508
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:46,030
And all these runs
that were supposedly lost at sea

509
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,364
somehow made their way
into Albert White's speakeasies.

510
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,938
Can you explain that?

511
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:53,697
No. I don't understand.

512
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,867
Dion drove me by your house
on the way over here.

513
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,672
You got a lovely place.

514
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,115
You're gonna have to pack up all that shit
and send it wherever it is you're going.

515
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:02,942
Where am I going?

516
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:04,483
Are you fucking her?

517
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,121
What'? Who'?

518
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,018
- Miss Roe.
- What?

519
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,715
- He's fucking her.
- Without question.

520
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,621
<i>- Definitely fucking her.
- Oh, come on.</i>

521
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,820
Afternoon taste of Miss Roe.

522
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,784
<i>Sugar in the morning
Sugar in the-..</i>

523
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,391
Whatever. I don't care who you fuck.
Here's some tickets.

524
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,900
This is the 11:00 Seaboard tonight.

525
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,905
I don't care who you take with you,
but you gotta be on that train.

526
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,735
Wait a minute, gentlemen.

527
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,012
<i>- Come on a second here...
- We could go through the whole thing.</i>

528
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,481
I can bounce your head off the floor
like a fucking bowling ball.

529
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,143
But let's just make it easy.

530
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:38,514
Put yourself on that train, Gary L.

531
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,186
Or we're gonna have to put you under it.

532
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,985
Listen, I think... Could we...

533
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,657
Now, come on, fellas. Gentlemen, can we...

534
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,456
Let's just sit and visit with each other.

535
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,552
IS this...

536
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,889
Mr. Co...-

537
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,172
<i>Miss Roe!</i>

538
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,840
When did you mark the bottles?

539
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,503
Fuck you talking about'?

540
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,715
You've been with me every second
since I've been here.

541
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,184
See me mark any bottles?

542
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,219
No! That's how come
I knew it was bullshit.

543
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,376
- Dion Bartolo.
- Yes, of course.

544
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,143
This way, please. Mr. Esteban is waiting.

545
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,398
Mr. Suarez, nice to see you.

546
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,835
Let me introduce you to Joe Coughlin.

547
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:07,300
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Pleasure.

548
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,572
Have a drink.

549
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,112
Thank you very much.

550
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:17,344
I never agreed with the Spanish
that the lighter rums were superior.

551
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:18,815
Of course, we Cubans went along

552
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,456
because of our obsession
that lighter is greater in all things.

553
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,983
<i>Dion, Joseph, my sister, Graciela.</i>

554
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,356
- Nice to meet you.
- We've met.

555
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,327
My mistake. Of course, we have met.

556
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,795
Yes, we have.

557
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:31,956
How you doing?

558
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,432
Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you.

559
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,494
God, this rum is incredible.

560
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,766
Be nice if we could sell it up north.

561
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,807
When your country treats you like adults.

562
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:44,536
No hurry. We'd be out of a job.

563
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,543
Esteban took those.

564
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,608
- The working people of Miami.
- Very good.

565
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,809
It is a hobby.

566
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:53,114
Perhaps I photograph you
someday, Mr. Coughlin.

567
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,856
I don't know about that. Fewer pictures
out there of me, the better.

568
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,985
I'm with the Indians on that one.

569
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,128
<i>Speaking of captured souls,</i>

570
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,034
I've been told that Mr. Gary L. Smith
was seen boarding the Seaboard Limited

571
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,639
<i>with his wife in one Pullman,
and he had that puta maestra in the other.</i>

572
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:12,998
You never know.

573
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,971
Sometimes, a change of scenery
can do a man good.

574
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:17,976
<i>Is that why you're here in Ybor?</i>

575
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,239
Little change of scenery'?

576
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,748
I'm here in Ybor
to distill and distribute the demon rum.

577
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:26,376
A task which is made more difficult
by your erratic import schedules.

578
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:27,887
We don't control the tides.

579
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,922
Tides have been fine from here to Miami.

580
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,152
We know nothing of the boats to Miami.

581
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:35,228
Señor Famosa assures me
the tides have been calm all summer.

582
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,427
And you say Señor Famosa's name,

583
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,762
so we worry
you may overtake our supply routes.

584
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,498
No.

585
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:47,335
I use Señor Famosa's name to reassure you

586
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,773
that from now on,
you can work directly with me

587
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,911
<i>and that you can charge me a higher price.</i>

588
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,706
- What do we get in return?
- You get access

589
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,751
to Ormino's cops and judges,
which we now control.

590
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,989
And most of whom wouldn't do business
with you otherwise because you're Cuban.

591
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,284
And you would want exclusive access
to our molasses?

592
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,088
Nope. You just can't sell
to the White operation.

593
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,059
Albert White is a paying customer.

594
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:10,762
We've never had a problem with him.

595
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,128
<i>I know Albert White.</i>

596
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,550
I thought you might like
to deal with someone

597
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,992
who treated you like a human being.

598
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,733
<i>It is possible this will bring bloodshed.</i>

599
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,739
This will definitely bring bloodshed.

600
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,543
These are very favorable terms.

601
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,646
Albert White is what we get.

602
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:37,085
<i>The local sheriff wanted to see us.</i>

603
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,885
<i>Apparently, it was a custom down there</i>

604
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,893
<i>to talk about how you were gonna
break the Saw before you did it.</i>

605
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,793
What kind of guy is the chief?

606
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,161
He's a copper, so he's an asshole.

607
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,769
Beyond that, he's okay.

608
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,074
What are you doing?
Don't fuck with the guy's stuff.

609
00:43:56,233 --> 00:44:00,010
The sheriffs gonna come in to find some
dago going through his fucking papers.

610
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,414
Hey, this is Figgis right here.

611
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:12,920
Please, sit down.

612
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:27,041
I won't insult you
by asking the nature of your business,

613
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:31,110
so you won't have to insult me by lying.

614
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:33,981
That fair?

615
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,610
Sounds fair to me.

616
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:40,050
It true you're a police captain's son?

617
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,655
Yes, sir.

618
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:43,382
You serve overseas?

619
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:44,719
<i>France.</i>

620
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:47,556
Tell it to the Marines.

621
00:44:47,717 --> 00:44:48,992
Yes, sir.

622
00:44:49,152 --> 00:44:50,893
They told it to us.

623
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:53,831
<i>I was a soldier and then a U.S. Marshal.</i>

624
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,235
I've killed seven men in my lifetime.

625
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,833
Truth be told,
their faces haunt me most nights.

626
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,643
You keep your business north of 2nd,

627
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,552
south of 27th, and east of Nebraska,

628
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,492
you and I will have little
in the way of discord.

629
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,652
Sounds good.

630
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,831
I know we live in a fallen world,

631
00:45:26,923 --> 00:45:29,199
but just because I breathe corrupt air

632
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,539
and rub elbows with corrupt men,

633
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,844
never make the mistake of thinking
that I am corruptible.

634
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,177
I won't make that mistake.

635
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,208
Right.

636
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:49,349
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
Thought you were alone.

637
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:51,913
That's all right, Loretta.
These gentlemen were just leaving.

638
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:55,190
Honey, your manners.

639
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:56,730
Yes, Father.

640
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,858
Miss Loretta Figgis.

641
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,027
Pleased to meet you, miss.
I'm Joe Coughlin.

642
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,365
Dion Bartolo.

643
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:08,032
Loretta is taking the train
on a long journey today.

644
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,373
It's going around.

645
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,536
California.
- Is that right?

646
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:15,081
She's gonna be a star in Hollywood.

647
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,719
- It's only a screen test, Daddy.
- No.

648
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:22,112
A screen agent came here
and picked out a few girls.

649
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,981
My brother's out there.

650
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,059
Your brother's in Hollywood?

651
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:27,889
He's a stuntman, I'm told.

652
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,759
Falling off horses.

653
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,596
Pleased to meet you, miss.

654
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,628
<i>Chief.</i>

655
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:35,565
Gentlemen.

656
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,438
- You're sure you don't want a banana?
- No, that's all right.

657
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,239
- You can't get fruit like this in Boston.
- No, I know. It looks good.

658
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,672
- Uh-oh. Here she is.
- What?

659
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:48,282
- All right. Just watch this.
- Oh, yeah?

660
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,612
Hello. Good afternoon.

661
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,688
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

662
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,586
Excellent.

663
00:46:57,914 --> 00:47:01,760
You, uh... Have you and your brother
come to any decision on our...

664
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,597
Not yet.
We're still considering, Mr. Coughlin.

665
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:06,757
Okay.

666
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:09,699
Yes. It would be quite an upheaval for us.

667
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,429
I understand. Of course.

668
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:14,041
We don't make changes easily.

669
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:16,610
Oh. There's all kind of change, you know.

670
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:20,681
Where I was recently staying,
we used to play chess a lot,

671
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,614
and this is the kind of change
where you get your pawn

672
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:26,550
to the end of the board
and it changes into a queen.

673
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,621
There's not a lot to think about here.

674
00:47:28,778 --> 00:47:31,487
- Yes. I do play chess.
- You do?

675
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,958
Yes. My father taught me.

676
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,826
And what you might do well to remember
is that the pawn and the king

677
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,989
end up in the same box
at the end of the game.

678
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:43,670
The end? It's not about the end.

679
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,172
It's about when you're playing the game.

680
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,139
You could hang me upside down
and light me on fire at the end.

681
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,302
I wanna win while I'm playing.

682
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:57,378
I have a feeling
you win most of the games you play.

683
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,987
Not yet. But I plan on it.

684
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:04,190
Why don't you join me?

685
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:15,489
You know' some people say
liquor is only your side business.

686
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:16,893
Is that so'?

687
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:21,601
In fact, I heard rumors
you give most of your money away.

688
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,260
A lot of it in Cuba.

689
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,405
And you think that's foolish?

690
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:30,306
Not foolish.
It's just not my cause, that's all.

691
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,342
What is your cause?

692
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:34,778
The distribution of demon rum.

693
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:39,485
And that no man should rule
another man's life.

694
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:44,125
If you corner the rum market,
you will be a king.

695
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,451
I'll Still have to deal with Albert White.

696
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,597
But how will you hold the power
once you have it?

697
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:52,632
Why? You don't think I'm strong enough?

698
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,592
I don't know if you're cruel enough.

699
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,971
And if you are,

700
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,474
I will be very sad.

701
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:04,043
Powerful men don't have to be cruel.

702
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,213
But they usually are.

703
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,315
Tell me something. Do you think
there is such a thing as a noble man?

704
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:13,545
I got nothing against noble men.

705
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,657
They just rarely live past 40.

706
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,817
My father died for Cuba.

707
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,824
My mother died of a broken heart.

708
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:27,565
He would often tell Esteban and I,
"You cannot truly live

709
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:31,297
"unless there is something
for which you would die."

710
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:34,737
He sounds like a good man.

711
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:36,675
He WES.

712
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,724
We will never be lovers.

713
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:35,391
No?

714
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:39,965
Why is that'?

715
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,373
We will not be lovers.

716
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,943
<i>We cornered the rum market
and lived like kings.</i>

717
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:57,539
You know what'? Fine. Come on, hurry up.

718
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,052
<i>Banks collapsed. Jobs dried up.</i>

719
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,454
But vice, it seemed,

720
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,293
<i>was Depression-proof.</i>

721
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,291
Okay, let's go.

722
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:18,168
<i>The Suarez-Coughlin
partnership created a rare stability.</i>

723
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:39,757
<i>We paid off Albert's guys
in Central Florida</i>

724
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,827
<i>to put down their guns.</i>

725
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:47,057
<i>So, when Amen wanted to hit us,
he had to use his Miami crews.</i>

726
00:53:51,994 --> 00:53:54,168
<i>And when they showed up,
we bushwhacked them.</i>

727
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,054
<i>Albert was living on the run in Miami,</i>

728
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:20,565
<i>and there wasn't a speak in Central
or North Florida we didn't sell to.</i>

729
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,851
Get something from in there
and put this shit out.

730
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,097
All right.

731
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,097
Get on the floor!

732
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,474
Get down, now!

733
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:05,001
Get on the floor. Get down!

734
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,239
Get down! Get down!

735
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,909
This is what happens

736
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:14,521
when Catholics
try to sell liquor down here.

737
00:55:14,677 --> 00:55:17,021
The guy's name is RD Pruitt.

738
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,626
Well, we'd better go find him.

739
00:55:19,782 --> 00:55:20,920
He's in the Klan.

740
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,427
So, what? So are five million
other guys in this country.

741
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,260
The Klan has a lot of fucking juice.

742
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,492
They're in breds
with fourth grade educations.

743
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,103
Oh, they're gonna love you.

744
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:32,637
A Catholic who works
with coloreds and lives with a Cuban.

745
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,943
Bigger problem is RD's brother-in-law.

746
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:36,099
Who's he?

747
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,608
Chief Figgis.

748
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,521
Joe Coughlin.

749
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,190
Don't shake hands with papists.

750
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,628
No offense.

751
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:01,791
<i>None taken.</i>

752
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:05,302
Would it help if I told you
I haven't been to church in half my life?

753
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:10,208
All right, now.

754
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,641
RD,

755
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,313
word is you're causing trouble
down in Ybor.

756
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,983
How's that'?

757
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:22,489
Well, we hear you're sticking up places.

758
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:26,358
I don't know a damn thing about that.

759
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,496
I'm just playing with you.

760
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:33,327
You all know that.

761
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:36,326
RD,

762
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:40,737
this is a businessman
who's come hereto do business.

763
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,902
And I suggest that you do it with him.

764
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:49,340
This man is a bootlegger
and a fornicator with niggers.

765
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:55,952
He needs to be tarred and feathered,
not done business with.

766
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,291
I'm just playing-

767
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,760
You can take a joke, right'?

768
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,195
Sure, I can take a joke.

769
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,858
Long as you don't become one, right?

770
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,539
So, you like the Parisian, right?

771
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:15,869
And if I did'?

772
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,036
I might be able to cut you in
on 10% of the house take.

773
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,204
- You'd do that?
- I would.

774
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,576
Well,

775
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,043
I ought to be worth more than 10%.

776
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,483
What were you thinking?

777
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:29,123
I was thinking 60.

778
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:30,655
<i>60%?</i>

779
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,293
The biggest club in town'?

780
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:33,817
That's right.

781
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,657
For what, exactly?

782
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:38,730
My friends might look on you more kindly.

783
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,061
- What friends?
- 60%.

784
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,965
Son, I ain't giving you 60%.

785
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,733
I ain't your son. Ain't nobody's son.

786
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,070
Save your father some embarrassment.

787
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:51,177
<i>- What's that?
- 15%.</i>

788
00:57:52,668 --> 00:57:54,239
I will beat you to death.

789
00:57:54,403 --> 00:57:55,405
Excuse me'?

790
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,282
You know,

791
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:03,353
that does sound like a fair arrangement.
You go to 20?

792
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:07,688
I think 15's pretty good for a job
you don't have to show up to work for.

793
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,195
Well, it's a fair deal

794
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,597
and I'm pleased to agree to it.

795
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,467
How do I pick up my cut'?

796
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,106
Come by the Parisian.

797
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:22,469
Second Tuesday, every month, 7:00.

798
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,269
Pleasure, Mr. Coughlin.

799
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,206
Irv.

800
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:35,278
Sounds like we have a deal.

801
00:58:38,614 --> 00:58:40,992
Boy's dumb as a grape.

802
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,226
I don't understand what Maso wants.

803
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,996
Arrests are down 70%, revenue's up 300%.

804
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,572
I don't like getting some kid
sent down here like we need supervision.

805
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,471
No! We don't need supervision.

806
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,635
Digger wants to look at the casino option,
check progress, that's all.

807
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,146
He's gonna report back to the old man.

808
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,480
It's a joke. Don't make a big thing of it.

809
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,798
<i>Maso's still gonna listen to what his son
tells him about starting a new casino.</i>

810
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:06,956
Don't worry about it.

811
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,396
How did he get the name "Digger"!

812
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:09,672
Because he's a fucking dummy.

813
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:13,021
All they let him do is dig ditches
for the bodies they bump off.

814
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,559
- No shit?
- Yeah.

815
00:59:17,753 --> 00:59:19,097
That's great.

816
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,099
<i>I'd come up with a plan
to invest in a casino</i>

817
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:26,230
<i>with stakeholders in Sarasota
at the new Ritz development site.</i>

818
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:28,666
Ritz Hotel and Casino.

819
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,277
Top shelf. A-one.

820
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:31,606
Right to the casino.

821
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,269
Absolute top-level resort.

822
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,509
Extraordinary resort experience
whether you gamble, or not.

823
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:43,248
<i>For such a violent business,</i>

824
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,619
<i>it was populated with
a surprising number of guys</i>

825
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:48,193
<i>who were just putting food on the table.</i>

826
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,762
<i>Digger wasn't one of those guys.</i>

827
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,032
So, this is it.

828
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:57,297
Volstead Act won't last forever, right?

829
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,963
What are we gonna do
when Prohibition ends?

830
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,130
Gambling.

831
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,617
We use the connections
we put together to get it legalized.

832
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,713
And we're the only ones in place
to run it.

833
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,143
And this is it?

834
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:09,045
It will be. Ritz Longboat Key.

835
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,152
I sat down with the owners
in Sarasota last week.

836
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,650
Why did they let us in'?

837
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,188
Because they can't get gambling legal,
and they can't run a casino.

838
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:18,784
They own the property, we run the casino.
We chop the profits 50-50.

839
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,552
Wait a minute.

840
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,492
Do we have a magic stick
for changing laws?

841
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:24,960
I heard you got bingo legal.

842
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:28,867
It's a step. It's that prerequisite.
You gotta do one thing,

843
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,869
- and then you get...
- Yeah, I know. It was a prerequisite.

844
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,175
Your grandmother can come down.
She'll play in the church.

845
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,003
Bingo!

846
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:39,809
Look, I got bagmen buying inspectors
in Tallahassee and Sarasota.

847
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,076
I got guys going after senators
and IRS agents who gamble.

848
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:47,153
We get gambling legal, we are rich. Legit.

849
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:49,653
For the long fucking haul.

850
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,989
I talk a good game, too.

851
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,255
But I like you.

852
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,028
He's a very smart boy.

853
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,266
<i>Maso went crazy for the casino.</i>

854
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:07,931
<i>Called every day for updates
like ii was his idea.</i>

855
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:41,974
<i>It was addressed to
“Sir Joseph Coughlin, nigger fucker."</i>

856
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,804
<i>inside, was a two-word note'</i>

857
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,708
<i>"Sixty percent."</i>

858
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,164
<i>Same note. Same message.</i>

859
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:21,014
We're doing everything we can,
but he's protected.

860
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,172
His roots here are too deep.

861
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,911
Well, time to start digging.

862
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,032
<i>Afternoon, gentlemen.
Virgil Beauregard.</i>

863
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,032
What can I do for you today?

864
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,802
We're hoping you can talk
some sense into RD Pruitt.

865
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:51,112
Ain't too many people
ever had much success doing that.

866
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:53,438
We'd like you to try.

867
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,275
And what would the reason be'?

868
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,815
His self-preservation.

869
01:02:56,972 --> 01:02:59,146
He needs to stop shooting up my clubs.

870
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,219
Clubs?

871
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,652
What kind of clubs? Bridge clubs'?

872
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:08,226
Because I belong to
the Greater Tampa Rotary Club myself,

873
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,159
and I don't recall ever seeing you.

874
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:13,896
I come here
to do a piece of business with you,

875
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,626
and you wanna play fucking games?

876
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:18,135
- Is that what I wanna do?
4.005',

877
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:21,574
you're the Grand Wizard
of the Ku Klux Klan around here.

878
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:23,141
<i>Congratulations.</i>

879
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,277
But do you think that we got where we are

880
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,907
by letting some inbred
shit pickers muscle us?

881
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:33,744
If that's who you think we are,
you're making a fatal miscalculation, son.

882
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,757
'Cause we're clerks, and bankers,

883
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:40,751
and police officers, and deputies, and...

884
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,855
Hell, we even got a judge.

885
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:46,134
And if you're dim enough to fight us,

886
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,094
we're gonna rain bloody hellfire
down on you

887
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:52,766
and all you love.

888
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:57,103
So, you're threatening me with people
who are more powerful than you?

889
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,840
Exactly.

890
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,523
What the fuck am I talking to you for?

891
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:35,574
You've come to my home.

892
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:37,717
Thought I'd save you
the trouble of hauling me in.

893
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,152
Seventy-five witnesses.

894
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,311
Not a one will come forward.

895
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,347
You want a beer'?

896
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:46,820
It's near beer, but it ain't bad.

897
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,393
I'd love one.

898
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,501
Than ks.

899
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,521
I need RD, Chief.

900
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,918
I expect you'd feel that way.

901
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,923
You know what happens
if you don't help me.

902
01:05:22,217 --> 01:05:23,958
No. I don't.

903
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,867
More bodies are gonna pile up.

904
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:30,869
More articles like "Cigar City Slaughter"
are gonna get written.

905
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,105
And the chief's gonna get pushed out.

906
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,643
You, too.

907
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,101
Maybe.

908
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,146
Difference is, when you get pushed out,

909
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:45,251
someone does it
with a bullet to the back of your ear.

910
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:52,052
I'm not selling out my wife's brother.

911
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,396
I don't wanna do this.

912
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,623
Do what'?

913
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,467
I don't wanna do what you're making me do.

914
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:03,297
I'm not making you do anything.

915
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:04,833
Yeah, you are.

916
01:06:08,797 --> 01:06:09,902
What'?

917
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:12,409
She didn't make it to Hollywood.

918
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:15,943
She just made it to Los Angeles.

919
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,434
That's not right.

920
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:43,509
We got her with a special doctor now.
She's all right.

921
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:47,708
What kind of doctor?

922
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,614
Kind that gets people off heroin, Irv.

923
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:56,382
You do not ever call me
by my Christian name.

924
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,056
You'll call me Chief Figgis

925
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:03,492
for whatever years or days
remain in our acquaintance.

926
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:04,653
Are we clear'?

927
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,958
I didn't do this to her.

928
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:10,297
You just name your price
for telling me where my daughter is.

929
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,201
She's in a clean, safe facility,

930
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,536
and I'm not gonna tell you
where she is until you...

931
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,472
Until?

932
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:03,789
<i>RD, you are gonna
meet with this boy again,</i>

933
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,251
<i>another discussion
to be had on the matter.</i>

934
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,204
<i>Yeah, M! just be the two of us.</i>

935
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:26,074
<i>Longboat Key, by the Ritz.</i>

936
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:27,770
<i>Tonight at 10:00.</i>

937
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,386
When do I get her location?

938
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,788
Soon as I get out of this meeting alive.

939
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,921
You do it yourself.

940
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:46,293
What's that'?

941
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,457
<i>If you're gonna km him,</i>

942
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,002
be man enough to pull the trigger.

943
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:55,734
Ain't no pride in having other people do
what you're too weak to do yourself.

944
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,641
Okay.

945
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:01,980
In my experience,
it doesn't take much to pull a trigger.

946
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,270
Hey, RD.

947
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,010
Where's my brother-in-law?

948
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:38,042
He didn't come.

949
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,449
Boys, this one here is rat tricky.

950
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:48,859
Take your eyes off that peashooter,
I promise it'll be in his hands.

951
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,292
Not likely.

952
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,462
You a man of your word?

953
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,505
Depends on who I give it to.

954
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,404
So, you ain't come alone like I ordered?

955
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:06,671
Shit, RD, that would spoil the fun.

956
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:10,578
Where they at?

957
01:10:11,573 --> 01:10:13,786
You know, this could be
the biggest casino in the United States

958
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,850
when they end Prohibition?

959
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:17,514
They ain't gonna end Prohibition
in a God-fearing country.

960
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,181
Country's in the tank.

961
01:10:19,347 --> 01:10:21,385
Banks going under, cities are bankrupt.

962
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,552
Because we got a communist president.

963
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,393
Because we're not taxing liquor.

964
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,661
And that's why the state's gonna
change its laws to legalize gambling.

965
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,168
And you could be part of that.

966
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:33,503
I don't wanna be a part
of nothing with you.

967
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:41,073
How much is he paying you?

968
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,775
Who?

969
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,384
Albert White.

970
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:46,712
How much is he paying you
to shoot up my speaks?

971
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:49,015
Because you're doing
a hell of a job for him.

972
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,926
Yeah, I took his Catholic money.

973
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,525
You know why?
Because I'd have done it for free.

974
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,095
You are a pestilence.

975
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:07,030
You and your nigger whore girlfriend
and your dirty dago friends.

976
01:11:08,363 --> 01:11:10,240
I'mma take the Parisian.

977
01:11:11,466 --> 01:11:13,070
Not 60%.

978
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,976
The whole thing.

979
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,881
I'mma take all your clubs.

980
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:19,951
I'mma take everything you got.

981
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,886
Might even go by your house,

982
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:28,559
tear off a piece of that nigger girl
before I out her throat.

983
01:11:30,485 --> 01:11:34,127
You ain't got this yet,
but you leaving town, boy.

984
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,064
You just forgot to pack your bags.

985
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:40,764
All right.

986
01:11:41,596 --> 01:11:42,597
Go ahead.

987
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,113
Fuck.

988
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,248
Oh, shit.

989
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:57,582
Shit.

990
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,792
Bring the car around.

991
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:00,984
<i>Au right.</i>

992
01:12:01,149 --> 01:12:03,027
- We'll get you to a doc.
- Fuck. It hurts.

993
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:05,426
Yeah. It hurts,
but it's not gonna kill you.

994
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:06,965
- Shit.
- Hold that.

995
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,768
Oh, shit.

996
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:13,000
Oh, fuck. We should have
never shown him the pictures.

997
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,438
- What pictures?
- Figgis.

998
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,873
That's what we had to do
to put this fucking guy down.

999
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,877
Price was too high.

1000
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,511
I think it was you who shot me.

1001
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,653
- What?
- I got him before he got a shot off.

1002
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:27,953
- It wasn't me who shot you.
- It couldn't have been nobody else.

1003
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,255
- Fasani was back there.
- It was Fasani who fucking shot you.

1004
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,789
No, Fasani was coming from back there.

1005
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,091
- Fasani came over here.
- Fasani was back there, shooting this way.

1006
01:12:34,115 --> 01:12:35,661
He came on this angle like this.
Right here.

1007
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:36,890
I was over here.

1008
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,293
- I got these motherfuckers.
- You hit me!

1009
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:41,297
- Just get the fucking car around.
- All right.

1010
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:44,171
It's gonna be a great casino.

1011
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:47,365
- Right?
- Yeah.

1012
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,672
<i>Albert had been paying RD on his own
to come after us.</i>

1013
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:58,409
<i>But once we kilted members of the Kian,
the Klan took it personal.</i>

1014
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,484
<i>They came to finish me off
at the hospital,</i>

1015
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:04,658
<i>but we had guards posted at the doors.</i>

1016
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:14,759
<i>When the Klansmen gave up and went home,
Dion had them followed.</i>

1017
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,680
<i>The subsequent string of
beatings, bombings, and murders,</i>

1018
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:31,409
<i>effectively put an end
to the power of the KKK in Tampa.</i>

1019
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,332
How do you feel?

1020
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:48,356
I'm all right.

1021
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,594
You are'?

1022
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:51,462
Thank you.

1023
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:32,442
<i>Irv's wife moved out
and took their son with her.</i>

1024
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,744
<i>No one saw Loretta for the whole season.</i>

1025
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,011
Can Hake your name?

1026
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:42,882
You wanna get married?

1027
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,680
What'?

1028
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:47,514
Well, we are married, aren't we?

1029
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,015
Graciela Isabella...

1030
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,590
I can't remember them all.
Lunes, Martes...

1031
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:59,926
- Estupido! I don't have that many names.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1032
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,671
Graciela Coughlin.

1033
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,270
Best thing that ever happened
to that name.

1034
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,445
I bought buildings.

1035
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:23,682
Wow! We're married and, just like that,
now you bought some buildings?

1036
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:26,689
Yes. I bought three buildings
by the Perez factory.

1037
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:28,692
What are you gonna do
with these buildings?

1038
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:32,024
I want to give shelter
to abandoned women and their children.

1039
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:34,030
It's important, Joe.

1040
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,969
What happened to
Cuban politics for a cause?

1041
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:41,898
I fell in love with you.
You restrict my mobility.

1042
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:46,270
Come here. I love you.

1043
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,881
<i>After months of seclusion,</i>

1044
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,385
<i>Loretta emerged from home
and declared she would only wear white.</i>

1045
01:16:54,909 --> 01:16:59,416
<i>A decision made for her by Jesus Christ
to whom she would now be wed.</i>

1046
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,497
Damnable business.

1047
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:09,100
<i>Her show was a hit.</i>

1048
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:13,569
<i>And her vision of Tampa cleansed of sin
didn't include a casino.</i>

1049
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,501
<i>What's the problem with this preacher?</i>

1050
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,145
There's no problem with the preacher.

1051
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:20,737
Everything's gonna work out fine.

1052
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:23,679
Nothing can jeopardize our casino deal.

1053
01:17:23,838 --> 01:17:25,511
Absolutely, Maso. 100%.

1054
01:17:25,673 --> 01:17:26,913
Do what you need to.

1055
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,520
<i>Look, I'm gonna go down there.
I'm gonna talk to her.</i>

1056
01:17:32,747 --> 01:17:35,354
<i>Whatever needs to be done
will get done, okay?</i>

1057
01:17:35,518 --> 01:17:39,863
Just make sure the problem goes away.
I don't want to hear about it.

1058
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:41,762
All right. Thanks a lot.

1059
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:53,938
You don't need to listen in on me.

1060
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:57,277
Ask me anything you want
about my business, I'll tell you.

1061
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,948
It's your business, not mine.

1062
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,050
But I will.
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

1063
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:05,283
Yeah.

1064
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:13,456
I came down here, it was all about
getting revenge, making money.

1065
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:17,801
Now, everything I do, every step I take,

1066
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,805
is about you and me
and protecting our future.

1067
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,636
And that's what you need to understand.

1068
01:18:23,798 --> 01:18:28,805
But if those steps make you,
even little by little, someone else,

1069
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,582
then you will not be you anymore.

1070
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,811
You're you,
except for all those bad things you did.

1071
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,023
You're almost you.

1072
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,554
I want the real you.

1073
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,197
You have me.

1074
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,832
You have me. Come here.

1075
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,170
You have me.

1076
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,189
<i>Gambling destroys the spirit.</i>

1077
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
<i>Amen.</i>

1078
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,527
One hears much

1079
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:25,702
of personal liberty.

1080
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:30,539
But when you've seen the barbarity of man

1081
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,577
and been treated to personal doses...

1082
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:46,552
You see'
it is simply liberty for the gambler.

1083
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,655
For the gambler
to fritter away the gifts of God,

1084
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,422
<i>using it for himself.</i>

1085
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:53,588
Amen.

1086
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:57,396
Personal liberty

1087
01:19:58,092 --> 01:19:59,902
is the liberty

1088
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,265
of a murderer.

1089
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:06,569
A seducer!

1090
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:14,515
A wolf who wants to remain in a sheepfold.

1091
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,418
I ask you,

1092
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:23,457
how cheap is your virtue?

1093
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:25,599
- No! Not cheap!
- Not cheap.

1094
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,091
How cheap is your virtue?

1095
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,362
It's not!

1096
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:32,594
My virtues always been pretty cheap.

1097
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:33,864
What virtue?

1098
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:39,979
And they seek to build a house of gambling
on our waterfront!

1099
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:42,444
No!

1100
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:44,105
But we acquiesce.

1101
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,893
I'll tell you,
there's only one way to deal with it.

1102
01:20:54,048 --> 01:20:56,289
With her around,
the casino gets voted down.

1103
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:58,226
The casino gets voted down,

1104
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,128
- me and you are on the hook for it.
- I'll handle it, okay'?

1105
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:04,627
- Mr. Coughlin!
- Miss Figgis.

1106
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:07,671
Such a pleasure.
Thanks so much for seeing us.

1107
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:08,869
It was a great show today.

1108
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,067
- Great.
- Terrific.

1109
01:21:10,231 --> 01:21:11,676
And you know my father.

1110
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,034
Chief.

1111
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,340
And this is Mayweather.

1112
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:18,144
Mayweather's taking the good word
and preaching it down south.

1113
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:19,478
It's a pleasure, sir.

1114
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,153
My pleasure. That's good.
They need to hear about this in Miami.

1115
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,985
- Keep up the good work.
- I'll try, sir.

1116
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,146
Great.

1117
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:26,349
What can I do for you?

1118
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:30,395
I was hoping I could
just have a word with you for a second.

1119
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:37,494
I was hoping to, uh,
talk to you a little bit about the Ritz.

1120
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:42,873
My father says
there once was a good man in you.

1121
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:46,337
I wasn't aware he'd departed.

1122
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,175
<i>You do quite a lot for the people here.</i>

1123
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:51,679
But we both know
your good works are mitigated

1124
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,341
by your evil deeds.

1125
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:54,846
We do'?

1126
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,350
You profit from
the illegal addictions of others.

1127
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:01,791
Their weakness and sloth
and libidinous behavior.

1128
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:05,020
But you can free yourself of that.

1129
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,726
But I don't want to.

1130
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,029
Of course, you do.

1131
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:13,032
Miss Figgis, you're a lovely woman.

1132
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:15,405
And your story is amazing.

1133
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:18,545
I'm not surprised the flock's
up threefold since you started here.

1134
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:20,202
More like five times.

1135
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:24,578
More booze has been drunk
in the last 10 years than ever before.

1136
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,980
Because people don't wanna be told
they can't do it.

1137
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:30,216
The same could be said of fornication.

1138
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,055
People want it,

1139
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,421
but don't want to be told
they can't have it.

1140
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:35,720
Well, nor should they.

1141
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:37,724
I'm sorry?

1142
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:40,564
If people want to fornicate,
I see no reason to stop them.

1143
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:43,296
And if they wish to lie down with animals?

1144
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,229
Do they?

1145
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:46,395
I'm sorry?

1146
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,302
Do people wish to lie down with animals?

1147
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:49,465
Some do.

1148
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:52,077
And their sickness will spread
if you have your way.

1149
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:55,145
Forgive me. I see no correlation between
alcohol and lying down with animals.

1150
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,582
There's a correlation across all sin.

1151
01:22:57,738 --> 01:23:03,246
It is all against the wishes of God,
therefore, all equally offensive.

1152
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:07,621
Let me apologize.
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.

1153
01:23:07,783 --> 01:23:11,595
I'm just here to ask you
if you would be amenable to omitting

1154
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:16,099
the casino issue from your sermons,
and in exchange,

1155
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,930
we're gonna bring a business here.

1156
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:19,595
<i>Business will create jobs,</i>

1157
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:24,608
which will reduce the sinfulness
that comes with poverty and idle hands.

1158
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,212
We'd be willing
to contribute to the church.

1159
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:29,975
Hell, we'd be willing to
build a few churches.

1160
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:40,154
If God rewrites the Bible
to cast gambling as virtuous,

1161
01:23:40,314 --> 01:23:43,125
I will refrain from speaking against it.

1162
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:45,621
But until then,

1163
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:49,625
we don't get to pick
our sins, Mr. Coughlin.

1164
01:23:54,962 --> 01:23:56,465
I can't do it.

1165
01:23:57,164 --> 01:23:58,166
What'?

1166
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:01,311
She's gonna fuck up the whole deal.
What do you mean you can't do it?

1167
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:04,043
I know. No one touches her.

1168
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,878
That's a mistake.

1169
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,823
No shit.

1170
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:26,264
<i>Can we get you anything?</i>

1171
01:24:26,427 --> 01:24:28,338
Oh, we're okay. Thanks.

1172
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:32,673
We know you men are busy,
and we don't want to waste your time.

1173
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:36,179
We're not going to invest
in the casino at the Ritz.

1174
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:41,547
Are you sure about that?

1175
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,690
I'm afraid so. The publicity is too much.

1176
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:47,019
One woman preaching in a fucking tent?

1177
01:24:47,181 --> 01:24:51,688
<i>Yes, because the casino would represent
only 2% of our total holdings.</i>

1178
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:57,131
And we can't appear to be
a company of Irish and Italian Catholics

1179
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,296
turning white Protestant girls
into drug addicts.

1180
01:25:01,195 --> 01:25:04,369
The people I work for
are gonna be very upset about this.

1181
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:07,036
We aren't men to be muscled or conned.

1182
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:10,581
We're an institution.
We can't be bribed or bullied

1183
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,082
because I simply represent
the vested interest

1184
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,810
of a board of governors.

1185
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:18,048
We are the landed
white gentry in this country

1186
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:22,889
and we have no plans
to carve off a strip of this country,

1187
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:26,260
which we have gone
to great pains to break and colonize

1188
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:31,564
<i>and hand it over to Catholics,
Jews, darkies or dagos.</i>

1189
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:35,838
It's just a bigger, better racket.
That's all.

1190
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:39,104
Keeping the money in your hands
and out of the hands of people like us.

1191
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,413
All those people,

1192
01:25:44,773 --> 01:25:46,252
the Negro

1193
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:50,412
on whose back you went
to great pains to break this country

1194
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:53,082
<i>and the immigrants
who came over here with nothing</i>

1195
01:25:53,247 --> 01:25:55,007
<i>and worked their fingers
to the fucking bone,</i>

1196
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:59,255
all believed it
when you told them they could get ahead.

1197
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,195
And one day' and I may not live to see it,
they're gonna figure it out.

1198
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:06,362
But I tell you what.
I'd hate to fucking be you.

1199
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:10,943
Standing between those people
and what they deserve.

1200
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:15,813
Good luck to you. Prick.

1201
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,648
Would have been a hell of a casino.

1202
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,954
You'll get another chance.

1203
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:26,614
Things swing back around.

1204
01:26:27,114 --> 01:26:28,957
Not all things.

1205
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:32,497
<i>They announced it on the radio
just when we got back.</i>

1206
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:38,403
<i>President-elect Roosevelt
promised to sign the Cullen-Harrison Act</i>

1207
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:43,202
<i>the minute he was elected,
effectively ending Prohibition.</i>

1208
01:27:21,168 --> 01:27:23,546
- Hello, Miss Figgis.
- Mr. Coughlin.

1209
01:27:23,704 --> 01:27:24,706
- May I?
- Yes.

1210
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:27,251
- Just for a minute?
- Yeah. Please sit.

1211
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,890
You're looking very well.

1212
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:34,784
I see you're not wearing white.

1213
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,721
It's almost white.

1214
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:38,886
Would you like a menu?

1215
01:27:39,054 --> 01:27:40,997
Thank you very much.
Could I have a cup of coffee, please?

1216
01:27:41,021 --> 01:27:42,023
Sure.

1217
01:27:45,025 --> 01:27:46,027
Thank you.

1218
01:27:53,033 --> 01:27:55,810
Why does my father hate you so much?

1219
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:03,050
I'm a crook. He's the chief of police.
That's how it goes, I guess.

1220
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,319
No. He liked you.

1221
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,823
He said you were the Mayor of Ybor.

1222
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:10,726
- Is that what he said?
- Mmm.

1223
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:16,065
What did you do?

1224
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:20,568
<i>To him?</i>

1225
01:28:33,108 --> 01:28:35,314
We had photographs.

1226
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:41,787
And you showed them to him.

1227
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,752
I showed him two.

1228
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:46,422
How many did you have?

1229
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:48,859
<i>All of them.</i>

1230
01:28:54,261 --> 01:28:56,367
We're all going to hell.

1231
01:28:57,932 --> 01:29:00,037
I don't think you're going to hell.

1232
01:29:00,202 --> 01:29:02,113
<i>You know what I learned</i>

1233
01:29:02,636 --> 01:29:07,279
as I've been thrusting my soul out to God?

1234
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:08,613
What'?

1235
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,451
This is heaven.

1236
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:15,158
Right here.

1237
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:17,627
We're in it now.

1238
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:19,826
Then how come it looks like hell?

1239
01:29:20,354 --> 01:29:22,301
Because we fucked it all up.

1240
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,311
After my trials,

1241
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:39,807
I slept in the bed of my childhood.

1242
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:46,015
I felt certain again.

1243
01:29:47,649 --> 01:29:49,322
<i>I missed that.</i>

1244
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:57,333
I don't know if there is a God.

1245
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:03,176
But I hope there is.

1246
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,574
And I hope he's kind.

1247
01:30:11,338 --> 01:30:13,716
Wouldn't that be swell'?

1248
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:19,051
<i>Yes, it would be.</i>

1249
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,864
You seem not to despair.
Do you have a secret?

1250
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,867
<i>Ne. No secrets.</i>

1251
01:30:32,359 --> 01:30:33,895
I have my wife.

1252
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:36,872
That's enough.

1253
01:30:37,564 --> 01:30:40,478
But what if you lose her?

1254
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,213
What are you gonna do now?

1255
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:48,618
What do you mean?

1256
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:51,886
You stopped me. Stopped the casino.

1257
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:54,926
Law couldn't do it.
The people couldn't do it.

1258
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,221
The Klan couldn't do it.

1259
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:58,386
You did it.

1260
01:30:58,552 --> 01:30:59,963
I didn't get rid of alcohol.

1261
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,225
No. That was too big.

1262
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:05,427
But you've stopped gambling, and before
you came along, that was a lock.

1263
01:31:05,592 --> 01:31:07,402
I did do that, didn't I?

1264
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:08,904
Yes, you did.

1265
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,073
What's your father gonna do'?

1266
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:17,404
Sit in his chair, I guess.

1267
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,981
Blind with rage

1268
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:24,118
that men touched his daughter
the way he used to touch his wife.

1269
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:25,814
And worse.

1270
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:36,595
He goes around the house
whispering one word over and over.

1271
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:38,469
What word?

1272
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:41,005
Repent.

1273
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:47,773
Repent, repent.

1274
01:31:50,337 --> 01:31:54,114
Give him some time.
Maybe he'll come out of it.

1275
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:31,220
We heard from Boston.
All three trucks made it up there fine.

1276
01:32:31,378 --> 01:32:33,188
Same payoffs as last week,
so it's no problem.

1277
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:34,485
Good. Good, good.

1278
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:37,993
And Loretta Figgis
cut her own throat yesterday.

1279
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:40,393
What'?

1280
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:42,875
Yeah, she did it at home
in the chief's bed, they say.

1281
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:45,997
<i>Gotta give it to her.</i>

1282
01:32:47,494 --> 01:32:49,872
She's got moxie. I couldn't do that.

1283
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:53,502
I don't know,
I guess some things are meant to be.

1284
01:32:53,667 --> 01:32:55,311
Hell, she could've done it
three months earlier,

1285
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:56,615
and done us all a fucking favor.

1286
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:00,847
Too late.

1287
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:16,265
<i>You blame yourself?</i>

1288
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:19,938
She went out west
as so many other girls do.

1289
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:22,197
And she was preyed upon.

1290
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:23,534
Not by you.

1291
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:25,371
By men like me.

1292
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:28,240
Men who get the booze,
they get the girls...

1293
01:33:28,403 --> 01:33:30,076
They get the drugs.

1294
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:31,911
One hand washes the other.

1295
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:38,046
We are not our brother's keeper.

1296
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:41,091
In fact, it is an insult to our brother
to believe we are.

1297
01:33:41,548 --> 01:33:42,993
Look at these people.

1298
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:47,927
If this man, say, dies of drunkenness

1299
01:33:48,088 --> 01:33:50,069
is it our fault?

1300
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:55,639
When did you take this picture?

1301
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:57,932
<i>A month ago.</i>

1302
01:33:58,932 --> 01:34:00,412
Are you sure'?

1303
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:06,442
<i>I took this picture myself
a month and three days ago.</i>

1304
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:07,746
<i>Why?</i>

1305
01:34:09,077 --> 01:34:11,454
Because that woman died in 1927.

1306
01:34:54,322 --> 01:34:57,462
There has never been
anyone like you in my life.

1307
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,463
And one day,
I'm gonna be good enough for you.

1308
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:06,868
- Are you sure it's her?
- You tell me.

1309
01:35:08,136 --> 01:35:10,514
- You tell Graciela?
- Of course I told her.

1310
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,315
Jesus Christ.

1311
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:15,810
What? You wouldn't tell your woman?

1312
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,011
No.

1313
01:35:17,177 --> 01:35:19,748
No, I don't tell them shit.
But you're more of a I work than me.

1314
01:35:19,913 --> 01:35:21,086
What'd you say?

1315
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:23,990
"Look, sorry, hon, that girl
I was bent out of shape over for years,

1316
01:35:24,152 --> 01:35:25,926
"she's not dead. She's in Miami.

1317
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:29,000
"Don't make
a big fucking thing out of it.“

1318
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:37,172
When you going?

1319
01:35:37,532 --> 01:35:39,131
<i>- Going where?
- What do you mean, where?</i>

1320
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,645
<i>You found out this girl
you used to be bugs for is 200 miles away.</i>

1321
01:35:41,668 --> 01:35:43,113
When you going?

1322
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:51,051
- Probably go after this thing with Maso.
- Good.

1323
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,385
Give you something to live for.

1324
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:55,050
What does that mean'?

1325
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:58,527
Him and his guys are
taking over half a train to get down here.

1326
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:01,560
That's a big fucking entourage.

1327
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,069
Ah, bullshit. I ain't worried about it.

1328
01:36:05,225 --> 01:36:07,069
There's no percentage in killing us.

1329
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:10,537
We doll and a half million dollars a year
from rum alone

1330
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:12,609
in this fucking cow town.

1331
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:14,444
What's he want to kill us for?

1332
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:17,707
All we do is send him bags of money
up to his mansion in fucking Nahant.

1333
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:19,043
I don't like the signs.

1334
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:20,913
- What fucking signs?
- We lost the casino.

1335
01:36:21,074 --> 01:36:22,194
We never moved on narcotics,

1336
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:25,088
and you're Irish in a world where there
ain't much of a shortage in guineas.

1337
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,720
Okay? You're walking into a building
where he bought up every room.

1338
01:36:28,882 --> 01:36:30,418
I can't hide a weapon. Nothing.

1339
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:32,622
You're going in blind
and we'll be outside.

1340
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,233
Is that enough signs for you?

1341
01:36:42,497 --> 01:36:44,238
<i>I need you to do something for me.</i>

1342
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:48,443
I need you to go slay in Miami
for just a little while.

1343
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:53,176
How long is a little while'?

1344
01:36:53,573 --> 01:36:55,417
I don't know. Not too long.

1345
01:36:56,411 --> 01:36:59,289
I'm not gonna have your address.
I want you to give it to Dion.

1346
01:36:59,447 --> 01:37:01,448
When the time comes,
he'll tell me where you are

1347
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:03,618
and I'll come get you.

1348
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,095
<i>So, you can find out if
you are as cruel as you need to be?</i>

1349
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:12,036
I guess so.

1350
01:37:13,795 --> 01:37:15,034
Joseph.

1351
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:21,273
Even if you win today's battle,
there's so much violence in what you do.

1352
01:37:29,777 --> 01:37:30,948
Come here.

1353
01:38:34,942 --> 01:38:36,444
Gino, where you living now?

1354
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:37,715
Neponset.

1355
01:38:37,878 --> 01:38:39,516
Oh. Settling down?

1356
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:43,127
<i>Two kids. A Nahant, 'a casa.
Whole thing.</i>

1357
01:38:43,283 --> 01:38:46,265
- You got any?
- None for me.

1358
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,728
There's never a right time.

1359
01:39:12,313 --> 01:39:13,587
This way.

1360
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:31,742
How are you, my son'?

1361
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:34,068
Fine.

1362
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:36,574
Fausto, see if Dion needs anything.

1363
01:39:51,452 --> 01:39:53,261
So, how've you been?

1364
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:54,922
Good. You?

1365
01:39:55,088 --> 01:39:57,261
More good days than bad.

1366
01:39:57,425 --> 01:39:58,426
Good.

1367
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:05,706
This is the filly
who fucked up the whole casino thing?

1368
01:40:07,268 --> 01:40:09,042
Yeah, that's her.

1369
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:11,614
Why didn't you clip her then?

1370
01:40:12,305 --> 01:40:13,613
Too much blowback.

1371
01:40:13,774 --> 01:40:15,117
That's not it.

1372
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:18,378
You're not a killer, Joseph.

1373
01:40:18,546 --> 01:40:20,492
You are a bandit in a suit.

1374
01:40:20,648 --> 01:40:24,118
<i>That's why you didn't kill that
Nahant Nahant.</i>

1375
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:26,685
You know how much money
this place was doing when I got here?

1376
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,900
- You know what it's doing now?
- But that's all rum.

1377
01:40:28,989 --> 01:40:31,402
You neglected the girls and the narcotics.

1378
01:40:31,559 --> 01:40:33,436
I went after the rum
'cause it was the most profitable,

1379
01:40:33,461 --> 01:40:35,167
and I added four houses in my time here.

1380
01:40:35,328 --> 01:40:36,899
Yeah, but you could have added more.

1381
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:38,167
Maso, look...

1382
01:40:38,332 --> 01:40:39,902
Mr. Pescatore!

1383
01:40:42,802 --> 01:40:46,751
I ran Ybor. I ran Tampa.
Did you ever have a problem?

1384
01:40:46,908 --> 01:40:48,011
<i>You did more than that.</i>

1385
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:50,246
You ran the whole coast.

1386
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:54,654
You boxed out Albert.
Put him in a little piss corner of Miami.

1387
01:40:54,981 --> 01:40:56,756
<i>We been through the books.</i>

1388
01:40:57,318 --> 01:40:58,990
You made us a force down here.

1389
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:02,595
But now what?
"No Irish need apply?" What can I be?

1390
01:41:02,756 --> 01:41:03,957
What I fucking tell you to be.

1391
01:41:04,492 --> 01:41:07,268
Before you get a fucking pop
in the mouth, Mick.

1392
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:12,007
<i>You can he Nahant.</i>

1393
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:16,045
You teach Digger the ropes. Meet people.

1394
01:41:16,604 --> 01:41:18,675
Teach him to fish.

1395
01:41:18,838 --> 01:41:20,681
But you need to take a haircut.

1396
01:41:21,341 --> 01:41:22,719
What kind of a haircut?

1397
01:41:23,543 --> 01:41:24,954
Digger gets your take.

1398
01:41:29,115 --> 01:41:31,686
Look, Mr. Pescatore,

1399
01:41:32,552 --> 01:41:34,533
I think it's a fabulous idea.

1400
01:41:34,889 --> 01:41:37,233
<i>Digger comes down here, takes over.</i>

1401
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:40,201
<i>We 'Il run Florida, we'll take over Cuba.</i>

1402
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,863
But my take's gotta stay
somewhere near where it is.

1403
01:41:43,029 --> 01:41:46,375
And there's no power in being crew boss
and shaking down longshoremen.

1404
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:49,480
You ever think maybe
that's the point, smart guy?

1405
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:51,912
You need me. I built this.

1406
01:41:52,073 --> 01:41:53,381
<i>We could use you.</i>

1407
01:41:53,541 --> 01:41:55,578
But I'm sensing a lack of gratitude.

1408
01:41:55,743 --> 01:41:56,743
So am I.

1409
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:00,547
<i>You work for me.</i>

1410
01:42:00,715 --> 01:42:04,060
Not the spics,
or the niggers you hang out with.

1411
01:42:04,217 --> 01:42:08,097
If I tell you to clean the shit
out of my toilet, guess what you do?

1412
01:42:10,725 --> 01:42:12,568
I can kill your cunt girlfriend

1413
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:15,900
and burn your house to embers
if I feel like it.

1414
01:42:17,564 --> 01:42:21,411
<i>So, do you want to be crew boss,</i>

1415
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:24,173
or clean the shit out of my toilet?

1416
01:42:24,337 --> 01:42:27,079
I'm accepting applications for both.

1417
01:42:34,347 --> 01:42:36,588
I guess it's crew boss.

1418
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:38,690
That's my boy.

1419
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:46,268
You want dinner tonight?
We have a few nice spots set aside.

1420
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:50,375
You know, Joseph,
what I like about Albert White?

1421
01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:52,376
What'?

1422
01:42:52,766 --> 01:42:54,439
It's that he knows Tampa, too.

1423
01:42:54,935 --> 01:42:57,471
Which means nobody needs you, dumb fuck.

1424
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:15,833
My fortunes have changed a little bit.

1425
01:43:17,725 --> 01:43:20,501
Me and Maso, we patched things up.

1426
01:43:20,828 --> 01:43:25,675
Turns out when you blew the casino deal,
he looked to me to help his son.

1427
01:43:25,832 --> 01:43:28,313
And that was just the start.

1428
01:43:30,003 --> 01:43:31,176
You see,

1429
01:43:35,576 --> 01:43:38,579
you need to trust the people
you work with.

1430
01:43:41,849 --> 01:43:45,159
We don't get into this game
to place second.

1431
01:43:45,418 --> 01:43:46,863
To back the wrong horse.

1432
01:43:49,657 --> 01:43:50,658
That's it.

1433
01:43:53,027 --> 01:43:56,702
You thought you'd be eating tomorrow,
looking at the fucking sun?

1434
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,002
Well, think again.

1435
01:44:01,534 --> 01:44:04,277
Take your last look because you die now.

1436
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:05,746
Wait.

1437
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:08,520
Albert, I have something you wanna see.

1438
01:44:09,009 --> 01:44:11,853
Something that if you don't see,
you'd regret your whole life.

1439
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:14,890
You'd never forgive yourself.

1440
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:23,292
She's dead.

1441
01:44:23,457 --> 01:44:24,868
She look dead to you?

1442
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,261
Where is she?

1443
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:30,408
She's in the fucking picture, Albert.

1444
01:44:34,568 --> 01:44:36,809
- Where is she?
- I'd love to tell ya.

1445
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:38,881
I'd love to walk outta here more.

1446
01:44:40,039 --> 01:44:41,382
That's an old one.

1447
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:43,854
<i>- You just folded up an old one.
- That's what I thought, too.</i>

1448
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:46,221
But, look, that guy
in the corner with the newspaper.

1449
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:47,381
That was last month.

1450
01:44:48,983 --> 01:44:52,395
You tell me,
or I'll put you in the fucking ground.

1451
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:54,389
I loved her, too, Albert.

1452
01:44:54,555 --> 01:44:55,898
Like you love that woman'?

1453
01:44:56,055 --> 01:44:57,126
Yeah.

1454
01:44:57,423 --> 01:44:58,903
She a nigger, or a spic?

1455
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:00,595
She's both.

1456
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:11,613
No! No!

1457
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:25,926
Where the fuck are they?

1458
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:29,192
Why don't you ask Albert? He knows Tampa.

1459
01:45:29,622 --> 01:45:32,432
You know why all the molasses and rum
that comes into Florida

1460
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:34,935
comes through Tampa, Maso?

1461
01:45:35,195 --> 01:45:36,197
The tunnels.

1462
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:37,432
What tunnels'?

1463
01:45:37,597 --> 01:45:40,601
The ones running underneath
this neighborhood.

1464
01:45:40,768 --> 01:45:42,805
<i>That's how they get the booze in.</i>

1465
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:45,882
<i>That's where my men are right now.</i>

1466
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:49,510
<i>Your guys are ail standing around,
guarding the front door.</i>

1467
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:51,881
<i>But that ain't where we're coming.</i>

1468
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:54,284
<i>We're coming for you, Maso.</i>

1469
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:58,990
But we're coming from below.

1470
01:47:58,072 --> 01:47:59,106
Go, go!

1471
01:48:05,912 --> 01:48:06,948
Go!

1472
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:14,854
You cleared the room?

1473
01:48:15,021 --> 01:48:16,626
Everything. The whole floor.

1474
01:48:16,789 --> 01:48:18,792
Seppe, give it another look.

1475
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:21,462
Boss, they spotted Coughlin downstairs.

1476
01:48:21,627 --> 01:48:23,436
He even get a scratch?

1477
01:48:23,596 --> 01:48:24,597
A cut on the head.

1478
01:48:24,765 --> 01:48:28,212
I don't suppose you can wait for him
to die of blood poisoning?

1479
01:48:28,368 --> 01:48:31,110
Well, I don't think
we got that kinda time.

1480
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:38,385
It's a hard thing fora man
to have a son this stupid.

1481
01:48:44,118 --> 01:48:45,461
All clear, boss.

1482
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:49,658
I want you to cover the door
and the stairs

1483
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:53,134
like Roman fucking centurions.

1484
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,849
Pour me one, will ya?

1485
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:28,600
Where were you hiding?

1486
01:49:28,761 --> 01:49:30,332
Hiding?

1487
01:49:30,497 --> 01:49:32,271
When Seppe cleared the room.

1488
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:34,105
Sitting right here.

1489
01:49:34,268 --> 01:49:37,715
I asked him if he wanted to work for
someone who'd be alive tomorrow.

1490
01:49:38,337 --> 01:49:39,338
That's all it took?

1491
01:49:39,506 --> 01:49:43,420
That, and you wanted to put
a fucking dunce like Digger in charge.

1492
01:49:43,844 --> 01:49:47,189
We had a good thing going here
and you fucked it all up in one day.

1493
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:52,060
You know how many people died here
'cause of your simple wop bullshit?

1494
01:49:52,219 --> 01:49:57,134
Maybe someday'
you'll have a son and you'll understand.

1495
01:49:57,557 --> 01:49:58,865
What will I understand?

1496
01:50:01,194 --> 01:50:02,195
How is my son?

1497
01:50:02,863 --> 01:50:04,934
Your son is dead now.

1498
01:51:00,621 --> 01:51:02,463
They would have killed
every last one of us.

1499
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:03,966
Hunted us down. You know that.

1500
01:51:07,094 --> 01:51:10,199
They didn't expect to see old age.

1501
01:51:11,664 --> 01:51:12,666
Neither do I.

1502
01:51:17,436 --> 01:51:20,475
I had this whole thing I was gonna say
to Albert before I killed him.

1503
01:51:27,381 --> 01:51:28,724
Too late.

1504
01:51:34,555 --> 01:51:35,726
All right.

1505
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:39,966
I don't wanna see
anyone else get killed today.

1506
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:41,569
Any of you guys wanna die?

1507
01:51:43,296 --> 01:51:44,297
No, Mr. Coughlin.

1508
01:51:44,463 --> 01:51:47,707
Whoever wants to go back up to Boston
has my blessing. Go ahead.

1509
01:51:49,368 --> 01:51:50,880
But if any of you want to stay down here,

1510
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:53,350
where the sun is warm
and the girls are pretty,

1511
01:51:53,573 --> 01:51:54,644
we got jobs for ya.

1512
01:51:58,545 --> 01:51:59,921
But I'm finished.

1513
01:52:00,646 --> 01:52:04,185
You want the boss? Go to him.
He runs things now.

1514
01:52:07,253 --> 01:52:09,256
Any confusion on that?

1515
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:12,560
Good.

1516
01:52:25,372 --> 01:52:27,180
Graciela.

1517
01:52:48,729 --> 01:52:51,368
All right, let's go.
Clean up this fucking mess.

1518
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:53,875
<i>Dion ran the crew for eight years.</i>

1519
01:52:54,734 --> 01:52:58,376
<i>And he was right. He didn't see old age.</i>

1520
01:53:51,792 --> 01:53:54,796
<i>- Say what you have to say.
- So, what?</i>

1521
01:53:55,595 --> 01:53:58,034
You had the wreck, you thought
you'd just make the best of it?

1522
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,872
<i>- No.
- Then, what?</i>

1523
01:54:02,935 --> 01:54:04,279
What happened, Emma?

1524
01:54:11,444 --> 01:54:13,287
Well, once the coppers
started chasing me,

1525
01:54:13,447 --> 01:54:17,554
I said to the driver, the only way
to get away was to drive off the bridge.

1526
01:54:19,219 --> 01:54:20,220
But he wouldn't listen.

1527
01:54:20,654 --> 01:54:21,689
So?

1528
01:54:22,456 --> 01:54:23,798
So, I shot him.

1529
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:27,466
<i>We went into the water. I swam out.</i>

1530
01:54:27,627 --> 01:54:30,631
Ran to the nearest house with a light on.

1531
01:54:30,963 --> 01:54:32,806
He was a fisherman.

1532
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,479
Oh, he was happy to take me in.

1533
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:37,342
You didn't wanna reach me?

1534
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:40,478
If I put my head up,
they would've killed me.

1535
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:42,914
I didn't owe you.

1536
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:45,752
I mourned you for years.

1537
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:48,686
Why don't you tell me
how bad I'm supposed to feel for ya?

1538
01:54:49,815 --> 01:54:52,989
Maybe if I had a police chief father
from a nice part of Ireland.

1539
01:54:53,153 --> 01:54:54,564
But I just had to make do.

1540
01:54:55,322 --> 01:54:56,891
Did you ever love me?

1541
01:54:57,890 --> 01:54:59,597
We had a laugh, Joe.

1542
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:02,435
Sure, there were moments.

1543
01:55:02,695 --> 01:55:05,176
<i>But you had to make it
something it wasn't.</i>

1544
01:55:05,332 --> 01:55:06,572
Which was what'?

1545
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:08,836
A lie.

1546
01:55:10,537 --> 01:55:12,778
<i>You know, we're not God's children.</i>

1547
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:16,953
We're not fairy tale people
in a true love book.

1548
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:22,083
We dance like motherfuckers,
so the grass can't grow underfoot.

1549
01:55:25,886 --> 01:55:28,957
I'm free, Joseph.

1550
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:33,802
If you wanna come by now,
you got an open invitation.

1551
01:55:43,703 --> 01:55:46,149
We always had a lot of laughs.

1552
01:55:50,577 --> 01:55:52,250
I don't wanna be free.

1553
01:55:53,046 --> 01:55:54,389
Oh, come on.

1554
01:55:56,048 --> 01:55:57,721
That's all we ever wanted.

1555
01:55:58,652 --> 01:56:00,096
It's what you wanted.

1556
01:56:01,421 --> 01:56:02,559
And now you got it.

1557
01:56:08,895 --> 01:56:10,396
Goodbye, Emma.

1558
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:44,168
<i>We built Graciela's casitas</i>

1559
01:56:44,331 --> 01:56:46,936
<i>for abandoned women and children
who needed a place to stay.</i>

1560
01:56:49,769 --> 01:56:51,942
<i>We named our son after my father.</i>

1561
01:56:57,010 --> 01:57:00,617
<i>But he was thoughtful,
kind like his mother.</i>

1562
01:57:01,146 --> 01:57:02,284
Yeah, Tomas.

1563
01:57:03,449 --> 01:57:04,792
Where you going?

1564
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:07,797
Where you going?

1565
01:57:25,404 --> 01:57:26,405
Repent.

1566
01:57:35,981 --> 01:57:36,983
Repent.

1567
01:57:40,654 --> 01:57:41,927
Repent.

1568
01:57:45,824 --> 01:57:47,532
Repent.

1569
01:57:58,872 --> 01:58:01,546
Come here, sweetie. Let me pick you up.

1570
01:58:01,707 --> 01:58:03,186
Repent!

1571
01:58:03,777 --> 01:58:04,778
<i>Repent!</i>

1572
01:58:04,944 --> 01:58:06,685
<i>- Tomas!
- Repent!</i>

1573
01:58:08,681 --> 01:58:09,854
Repent!

1574
01:58:11,016 --> 01:58:12,359
<i>Repent!</i>

1575
01:58:13,552 --> 01:58:14,725
<i>Repent!</i>

1576
01:58:31,537 --> 01:58:32,743
Are you all right'?

1577
01:58:37,543 --> 01:58:38,716
Oh, no.

1578
01:58:39,546 --> 01:58:40,615
Oh, no.

1579
01:58:45,051 --> 01:58:47,827
Oh, no, no.

1580
01:58:53,059 --> 01:58:55,733
Oh, God! Oh, God.

1581
01:58:56,729 --> 01:58:57,833
Oh, no.

1582
01:58:58,765 --> 01:59:00,904
Oh, God, no.

1583
02:00:06,565 --> 02:00:10,069
<i>On Saturdays,
I take my son to the shows.</i>

1584
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:23,323
<i>Some little German guy
is making trouble overseas.</i>

1585
02:00:23,483 --> 02:00:26,327
<i>I don't believe
they'll fight another war, though.</i>

1586
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:29,661
<i>No percentage in it.</i>

1587
02:00:35,595 --> 02:00:37,836
<i>My son loved the show.</i>

1588
02:00:39,832 --> 02:00:42,939
<i>It was about an honest sheriff
in a dirty town.</i>

1589
02:00:50,342 --> 02:00:53,916
<i>All he could talk about
was getting his own badge when he grew up.</i>

1590
02:01:01,453 --> 02:01:02,796
That's my brother.

1591
02:01:05,692 --> 02:01:09,070
That was my brother's name.
That's your uncle.

1592
02:01:13,132 --> 02:01:16,739
<i>In the afternoons,
we fished for red fin and snook.</i>

1593
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:27,890
<i>One day, my son asked me,
“Where's heaven in the sky?"</i>

1594
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:33,220
<i>And I told him what Loretta told me.</i>

1595
02:01:37,724 --> 02:01:40,636
<i>"This is heaven. Right here.</i>

1596
02:01:43,429 --> 02:01:45,101
<i>"We're in it now."</i>

1
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,778
You know how you get rid of crabs?

2
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:35,990
- How?
- You got to shave one testicle.

3
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:40,495
All the crabs go over
to the other testicle,

4
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:43,248
you got to light the hair on fire
on that one.

5
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,209
When they all go scurrying out,
you take an ice pick and you fucking stab

6
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,169
every single last one of them.

7
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,327
<i>The Allied armed forces have been ordered</i>

8
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,079
<i>to suspend offensive action.</i>

9
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,582
<i>The proclamation of V-J Day</i>

10
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:10,168
<i>must await upon the formal signing</i>

11
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,503
<i>of the surrender terms by Japan.</i>

12
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,340
<i>The Japanese delegation lines up
on the opposite side</i>

13
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,675
<i>of the surrender table from the Alliance.</i>

14
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:21,262
<i>A war which had entered
its eighth terrible year in China,</i>

15
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:25,224
<i>which had raged for three years and nine months
for America and Britain,</i>

16
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,937
<i>which was the brutal, costly,
eastern half of the most horrible</i>

17
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,189
<i>worldwide war in human history,</i>

18
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:34,609
<i>is now within minutes of ending for good.</i>

19
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,778
<i>General MacArthur speaks.</i>

20
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,574
<i>Let us pray that peace</i>

21
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,078
<i>be now restored to the world,</i>

22
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:50,875
<i>and that God will preserve it always.</i>

23
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:55,547
<i>These proceedings are closed.</i>

24
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,967
<i>Swarms of United States aircraft</i>

25
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,595
<i>fly in formation overhead
as the ceremony ends.</i>

26
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:05,765
<i>The final United Nations victory
has been won.</i>

27
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:09,560
<i>The war is over, peace is here.</i>

28
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,997
Move it in.

29
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,332
Move it in.

30
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,794
Next table, next table.

31
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:39,507
Move it in. Move it in.
Move it in.

32
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,343
You men are blessed

33
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,471
with the rejuvenating powers of youth.

34
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:49,183
The responsibilities of peacetime
must now be considered.

35
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,020
You can start a business:

36
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,857
filling station, grocery or hardware store.

37
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,651
Get a few acres of land
and raise some chickens...

38
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,195
go back to school.

39
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,365
Undoubtedly, there will be people on the outside

40
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,035
who will not understand
the condition you men have,

41
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,829
or will think it
a rather shameful condition.

42
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,497
If the average civilian had been through

43
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,166
the same stresses
that you have been through,

44
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:17,045
undoubtedly they too would have developed
the same nervous conditions.

45
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,505
Freddie, I'm going to show you
a series of pictures.

46
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:22,967
I want you to tell me the first thing
that comes to your mind.

47
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,720
There's no right or wrong answers.

48
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,515
Tell me what you see.

49
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:33,227
Well, that's a pussy, a lady's pussy.

50
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,397
What about this one?

51
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,568
Looks like cock going inside of a pussy.

52
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,239
All right, let's try it again.

53
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,075
Tell me what you see, Freddie.

54
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,577
That looks like-

55
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,246
That's just like a cock,
actually, upside down.

56
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,586
Thank you.

57
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,070
<i>You've had episodes of enuresis?</i>

58
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,451
Yes, that's right.

59
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,703
My kidneys were all tore up
from it all over there,

60
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,956
and it came on strong.

61
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,794
And what's this about a crying episode?

62
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:41,754
What crying episode?

63
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,216
It says here you had a severe headache,
and a crying spell.

64
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,302
I didn't have a crying spell.

65
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:52,223
It was brought on by a letter
I received from a girl I knew once.

66
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,475
I think I-

67
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,103
I believe I suffered what,
in your profession,

68
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,106
you call nostalgia.

69
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:04,485
It was nostalgia that was brought on
by a letter I received.

70
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,989
From your sweetheart?

71
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,076
No, sir, not my sweetheart.

72
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,330
The kid sister of a girl-

73
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,667
The kid sister of a friend of mine
I knew from back home.

74
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,128
I received this letter, and...

75
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,014
I received a letter and I read it.

76
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,144
According to the history here,
I notice that you say

77
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:42,481
- you saw a vision of your mother.
- Now, it wasn't a vision.

78
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,859
- It was a dream.
- Well, tell me about the dream.

79
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:46,402
Why?

80
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,447
- I need to know.
- Why do you need to know?

81
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,451
This will help in your treatment.

82
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,037
You can't help in my treatment,
you don't even know-

83
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,666
Well, it was my mother and my father and me...

84
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,502
back home.

85
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,219
We were sitting around a table...

86
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,055
having drinks.

87
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:17,308
Laughing...

88
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,395
And it just sort of ended there.

89
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:29,362
Thanks for the help.

90
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,911
Now, you have such pretty eyes,

91
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,664
I want the light to catch it.

92
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,707
Look more this way.

93
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,502
Chin up a little. Okay.

94
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,838
And just look at me.

95
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,883
And smile.

96
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,260
Beautiful.

97
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,011
Ready?

98
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,222
Well, give a good smile.

99
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:06,399
Three, two, one.

100
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,650
Beautiful.

101
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:27,461
Only $49.99. Handmade.

102
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,975
Handmade imported mink. Only $49.99.

103
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,792
Forty-nine, ninety-nine.

104
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:35,196
Only $49.99.

105
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:38,324
- You have a break coming?
- I hope so.

106
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,660
- When?
- Ten minutes.

107
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,707
Taste good?

108
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,596
I have an apricot belly,
want to see?

109
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,515
Yes.

110
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,278
I'm really a very good girl.

111
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,864
Where do you get this idea about me?

112
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,867
Maybe we think the same things
at the same time.

113
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:08,622
Oh, my goodness. I think we do.

114
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,253
What else do you want to see, these?

115
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,880
Yes.

116
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,307
- Are they nice?
- Yes.

117
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:29,310
- Handmade.
- Yes, they are.

118
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:30,979
That's enough now.

119
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,275
Want to go out tonight?

120
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,944
Yeah, sure.

121
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,171
- Are you married?
- Uh, yes.

122
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,135
- This for your wife?
- Pardon me?

123
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,346
- This for your wife?
- Uh, yes.

124
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,886
Don't move. Just stay still.

125
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:03,070
It's a little warm.

126
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,156
It's hot.

127
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,417
I'm starting to sweat.

128
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,919
You need to shut up.

129
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,046
You need to move the God-

130
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,007
You need to shut up.

131
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,260
You need to back off.

132
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,886
Sit down. I'm very sorry.

133
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,597
I'm trying to get the lighting right.

134
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,850
You must understand,
I want to get the lighting right.

135
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,932
- That's enough.
- Little bit.

136
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,531
Drink that.

137
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,533
One gulp.

138
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,376
- What's your name?
- Frank.

139
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,294
Frank.

140
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,006
You look like my father.

141
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,526
Need some water.

142
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,238
We need to give him some water.

143
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:55,159
- I didn't put anything in his drink.
- Did you give him poison?

144
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,746
- No, everybody had the same thing.
- No, you're lying.

145
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,707
- I didn't lie, he's dehydrated.
- No, you poisoned him.

146
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,084
- No, I didn't poison him.
- No, you poisoned him.

147
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:08,422
- No. He took it, he took it himself.
- No. You poisoned him.

148
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,049
No, he needs some water.

149
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,094
- Move, move.
- No, no, you poisoned him.

150
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,764
- He needs some water.
- You poisoned him, you poisoned him.

151
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,932
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I didn't poison him.

152
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,227
I didn't do anything.
Please take your hands off me.

153
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,272
- I didn't poison him.
- You poisoned him.

154
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,445
I didn't do anything wrong, okay?

155
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,864
He took the drink himself, he took it.

156
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,449
I didn't do anything.

157
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,413
Good morning.

158
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,125
Are you all right?

159
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,628
Who are you? Where am I?

160
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,631
You're safe, you're at sea.

161
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:43,053
Here. Come with me.

162
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,145
Come on.

163
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,084
Here.

164
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,762
All right.

165
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,808
All right.

166
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,021
Is this your ship?

167
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,356
I am its commander, yes.

168
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,860
Where is it going?

169
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,531
New York City, through the canal.

170
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,325
You're a seaman.

171
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,620
Yeah. How did I get down here?

172
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,879
You were acting aggressive
because you drank too much alcohol.

173
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,220
No, I don't think so.

174
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:13,518
You told me you were an able-bodied seaman,
and you were looking for work.

175
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,814
I told you?

176
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,902
Yeah, well, you have any?

177
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,572
Why all the skulking and sneaking?

178
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,367
Work cannot be that difficult to come by.

179
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,752
That depends on when you're ready to go.

180
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,005
- You shouldn't work in your condition.
- No, I can work.

181
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,591
- You're aberrated.
- No, I'm not.

182
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,721
- Know what that means?
- No.

183
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,102
You've wandered from the proper path,
haven't you?

184
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,606
These problems you have-

185
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,858
I don't have any problems.
I don't know what I told you,

186
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,237
but if you have work for me to do,
I can do it.

187
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,452
You seem so familiar to me.

188
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,456
Yeah.

189
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,629
What do you do?

190
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,592
I do many, many things.

191
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,803
I am a writer, a doctor,

192
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,973
a nuclear physicist,
a theoretical philosopher...

193
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,227
but above all I am a man.

194
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,648
A hopelessly inquisitive man,
just like you.

195
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,742
Well, I'm sorry if I got
out of hand last night.

196
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:56,121
- It was cold and I was-
- Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel.

197
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,168
And as a scientist and a connoisseur, I have-

198
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:05,505
I have no idea the contents
of this remarkable potion.

199
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,840
What's in it?

200
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,845
Secrets.

201
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,849
Can you make more?

202
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,144
Well, not like that.

203
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,688
But I can make you
something different, better.

204
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,523
I'll make something special for you.

205
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,192
How do you like to feel?

206
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,697
I will give you a full reprieve
from your naughtiness

207
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,533
as a stowaway, if you make us some more.

208
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,662
I must admit I- I sampled it
and ended up drinking it all.

209
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,545
Would you scrub yourself
and make yourself clean.

210
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,173
My daughter is getting married.

211
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,550
Come and join us.

212
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,385
Leave your worries for a while.

213
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,804
They'll still be there
when you get back.

214
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,558
And your memories aren't invited.

215
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,690
Stand wherever you like.

216
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,236
Good day, good day, good day, good day.

217
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,071
What a day. What a day.

218
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:54,614
Mama.

219
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,242
Rascal.

220
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,577
Clark, big day?

221
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,621
- Big day indeed, sir.
- How are you feeling?

222
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,957
I feel pretty well, thank you.
How are you?

223
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,917
Wonderful.

224
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:09,629
As long as you hold these bodies,

225
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:14,718
in this life, you will be man and wife.

226
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,306
You may kiss the bride.

227
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,336
<i>Marriage!</i>

228
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:53,673
Previous to The Cause was awful.

229
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,514
Awful.

230
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,517
It was a cycle, like life.

231
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:09,314
Birth, excitement, growth, decay, death.

232
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:15,612
Now... now...

233
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,197
how about this?

234
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,827
Here it comes- a large dragon.

235
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,080
Teeth...

236
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,793
blood dripping, red eyes.
What do I got?

237
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:34,339
A lasso. I whip it up.

238
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,842
I wrap it around its neck,
and I wrestle,

239
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,970
wrestle, wrestle him to the ground.

240
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,557
I snap up. I say, "Sit, dragon."
Dragon sits.

241
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,185
I say "Stay." Dragon stays.

242
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,896
Now it's got a leash on it.

243
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,981
I take it for a walk.

244
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,569
And that's where we're at with it now.

245
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,824
It stays on command.

246
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,497
Next we're going to teach it
to roll over and play dead.

247
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,716
- Love that story.
- So, where are you from?

248
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,886
- Where are you from?
- Lynn, Massachusetts.

249
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:25,432
- Freddie Quell, how do you do?
- I'm Val. I'm his son.

250
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,351
Oh, yeah, I see it.

251
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:30,603
So what kind of work
will you be doing?

252
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,565
- Not sure.
- Done any Time Hole work?

253
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,443
- Any what?
- Any Time Hole work?

254
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,945
I don't think so.
I don't know what that is.

255
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,449
- I'm sure you're going to love it.
- I hope so.

256
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,201
- Nice to meet you and welcome aboard.
- Looking forward to it.

257
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,247
- How long have you known him?
- Good night!

258
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,374
- About three years.
- Good night, good night, good night.

259
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,293
Thank you, thank you for being here.

260
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,128
- Norman...
- Three years?

261
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,546
Thank you.

262
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,339
- Good night, Master.
- Good night.

263
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,759
When can we have some more of your potion?

264
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,261
Whenever you like, I'll make it.

265
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,472
When I like it,
I'll give you a signal.

266
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,724
I'll rub my nose and scratch my ear.

267
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,476
What will you need?

268
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,895
- I'll take care of it.
- Good.

269
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,314
- Anything you need.
- Thank you, good night.

270
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,442
Good night, everyone.

271
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,069
Don't get up. Don't get up.

272
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,157
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

273
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:26,242
What a day.

274
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,624
We fought against the day
and we won. We won.

275
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,176
Freddie, feel free to sit with us.

276
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,472
Can you invite him over?

277
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,265
Say, come on over.

278
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,362
Can you say hi?

279
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,365
<i>He's- been writing all night.</i>

280
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,618
You seem to inspire something in him.

281
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,819
Yeah?

282
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,997
When we're at home, on land,

283
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:16,376
there's too much pulling him
in each direction.

284
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,462
Every time he sits to write,
a new attack is launched against him,

285
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:22,799
and he spends too much time
defending himself.

286
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,717
Who's attacking him?

287
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,555
People who are scared.

288
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,724
People who are greedy.

289
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,520
Ex-wives.

290
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,233
That's what's so nice
about being at sea.

291
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,068
He gets his studies done.

292
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:45,905
Advances the learning. 
He writes book two.

293
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,869
Say "back beyond" and return
to the pre-birth area.

294
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:55,915
Back beyond, back beyond, back beyond.

295
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,084
Back beyond.

296
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,253
- How are you feeling?
- Back beyond.

297
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,340
Back beyond... I feel cold.

298
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:07,343
- Continue, please.
- Back beyond,

299
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,680
back beyond, back beyond.

300
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,724
Continue, please,
and tell me what you hear.

301
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,101
It's my mother.

302
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,689
Recall what she says.
Recall a sound.

303
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,776
It's her voice.

304
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:26,446
She's saying,

305
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,199
"We shouldn't be doing this,
not while she's inside me."

306
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,535
- Repeat what she says.
- "Not while I'm pregnant."

307
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,203
Repeat what she says.

308
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,040
Do you understand what's happening?

309
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,753
I'm not sure.

310
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,298
We record everything.

311
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,219
Really?

312
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,805
Through all lifetimes.

313
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:26,172
<i>Man is not an animal.</i>

314
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:31,761
<i>We are not a part
of the animal kingdom.</i>

315
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:36,432
<i>We sit far above that crowd.</i>

316
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:41,145
<i>Perched as spirits, not beasts.</i>

317
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,984
<i>You are not ruled by your emotions.</i>

318
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,195
<i>It is not only possible,</i>

319
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:54,784
<i>it is easily achievable
that we do away</i>

320
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:59,706
<i>with all negative emotional impulses,</i>

321
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:05,294
<i>and bring man back
to his inherent state of perfect.</i>

322
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:12,218
<i>Man is not an animal.</i>

323
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:18,224
<i>We are not a part
of the animal kingdom.</i>

324
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,811
<i>We sit far above that crowd.</i>

325
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,735
<i>Perched as spirits, not beasts.</i>

326
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:34,490
<i>You are not ruled by your emotions.</i>

327
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:39,996
<i>It is not only possible,
it is easily achievable...</i>

328
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,899
Cheers.

329
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,024
Oh, God!

330
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,911
Oh, God! Oh, God!

331
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,830
Freddie.

332
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,666
Lovely.

333
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,921
I've been writing.

334
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:16,342
Feel like I went under.

335
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:21,347
Dark cloud rolls in, opens up.

336
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:24,642
Anxious to share new work.

337
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:27,937
Would you care for some informal processing?

338
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,815
Sure. What do I have to do?

339
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,693
- Just answer my questions, we talk.
- Okay.

340
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,112
Very good. Have a seat.

341
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,033
How are you feeling, Freddie?

342
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,203
Good.

343
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,790
- You rested?
- Yes.

344
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,667
- Excited?
- Yeah.

345
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,878
Have you made some friends?

346
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,297
- Everyone is very nice here.
- Good. Good.

347
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:58,342
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah, good.

348
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:02,346
I gather myself.

349
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,891
You'll be my guinea pig and protégé.

350
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:10,563
Informal processing.

351
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:21,032
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

352
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,204
Say your name.

353
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,249
- Freddie Quell.
- Say it again.

354
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,751
Freddie Quell.

355
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:34,045
- Say it again.
- Freddie Quell.

356
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,172
- Say it again.
- Freddie Quell.

357
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:38,007
Might as well say it one more time,

358
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,508
just to make sure
you know who you are.

359
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,594
Freddie Quell.

360
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,596
Are you thoughtless in your remarks?

361
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:48,434
I usually put some thought into them.

362
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,603
Do you linger at bus stations for pleasure?

363
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,272
No.

364
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,691
Do you get muscle spasms for no reason?

365
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:57,777
No.

366
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:02,114
Do your past failures bother you?

367
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,532
No.

368
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,618
Do your past failures bother you?

369
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,037
No.

370
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,373
Do your past failures bother you?

371
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,250
No.

372
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:16,462
Do your past failures in life bother you?

373
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:19,799
No.

374
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,802
- Is your life a struggle?
- No.

375
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:26,138
- Do you like to be told what to do?
- No.

376
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,099
Is your behavior erratic?

377
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,145
No.

378
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,398
Do you find interest in other people?

379
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,316
Not really.

380
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,587
Do you find it easy to be fair?

381
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,488
Yes.

382
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,991
Are you often consumed by envy?

383
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,993
No, about what?

384
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,413
Are you often consumed by envy?

385
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,252
I don't unders-
You mean like jealousy?

386
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:59,588
- Like jealousy.
- Oh, well, yeah.

387
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,967
I don't like someone else's hands
on my girls.

388
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:06,637
I don't like to think about it.
It makes me sick.

389
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:09,348
Are you scientific in your thought?

390
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:12,768
Yes.

391
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,438
Are you concerned with the impression you make?

392
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:21,610
I don't understand.

393
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,696
Yes, you do.

394
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:31,370
Well, most people are asses,
if that's what you mean.

395
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,123
Are you usually truthful to others?

396
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,126
No. I don't know.

397
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:40,671
- Sometimes.
- Are you unpredictable?

398
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:53,726
Silly.

399
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,478
Silly animal.

400
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,980
- I couldn't help it.
- Dirty animal.

401
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,152
Sorry.

402
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,488
It's good to laugh during processing.

403
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:10,076
Sometimes we forget,
even if it is the sound of an animal.

404
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:19,919
Freddie Quell, test session,
March 5th, 1950, 1800 hours.

405
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:23,089
Aboard the sailing vessel Alethia.

406
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,883
LD, MOC, MD, logged and approved.

407
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:30,679
Should we sample another sip
before we join them upstairs?

408
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:32,264
Wait, that's it?

409
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,101
For now.

410
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:38,062
No, no, no, no.
You got to ask me more.

411
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,023
This is fun.
Come on, you got to ask me more.

412
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,194
Could you answer the next series of questions
without blinking your eyes?

413
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,738
- Yes.
- Without fear and hesitation,

414
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,116
- answer as quickly as you can?
- Sure.

415
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:55,589
Again.

416
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:08,425
Starting now, you are not to blink.

417
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,303
If you blink we go back to the start.

418
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,972
Infringement.

419
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,307
You blinked.

420
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,810
Starting now, you are not to blink.

421
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:20,437
If you blink, we go back to the start.

422
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:23,149
Do you often think about
how inconsequential you are?

423
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,608
No.

424
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:27,945
Do you believe that God will save you
from your own ridiculousness?

425
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,155
No.

426
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,657
Have you ever had intercourse
with someone inside your family?

427
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:33,826
Yes.

428
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:36,662
Have you ever had intercourse
with someone inside your family?

429
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:37,955
- Yes.
- Who?

430
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:39,790
- My auntie.
- Have you killed anyone?

431
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:41,250
- No.
- Maybe?

432
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,335
- Not me.
- Have you killed anyone?

433
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,962
- No.
- How many times did you

434
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:47,006
- have intercourse with your aunt?
- Three times.

435
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:48,799
- Where is your aunt now?
- I don't know.

436
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:50,176
Would you like to have intercourse
with her again?

437
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,343
No.

438
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,763
- Do you regret this?
- No.

439
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,516
- Where is your mother?
- I don't know. Loony-

440
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,185
- Infringement.
- Fuck!

441
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,690
- Back to the start.
- Okay.

442
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,864
Do you often think about
how inconsequential you are?

443
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:13,449
Yes.

444
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:15,868
- Do you believe that God will save you?
- No.

445
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:17,703
Have you ever had sex
with a member of your family?

446
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,996
- Yes.
- Are you lying?

447
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:21,040
- No.
- Who?

448
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:23,334
- My Auntie Bertha.
- Where is your aunt now?

449
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,211
I don't know, maybe home.

450
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,296
- Are you lying?
- No.

451
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:28,964
- Are you a liar?
- Yes.

452
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:32,009
- Have you killed anyone?
- Yes.

453
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:33,969
- Who?
- Japs in war.

454
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:36,388
- Do you regret this?
- No.

455
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:40,476
- What are you running from?
- Maybe I hurt a man, I think.

456
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,311
Maybe he's dead. I don't know.

457
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:43,729
- Where?
- In Salinas.

458
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:46,023
He stole a batch of my booze
and he drank it.

459
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,567
- Is this booze you make poison?
- Not if you drink it smart.

460
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,903
- Are you trying to poison me?
- No.

461
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,905
- Where is your father?
- Dead.

462
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:55,032
- How did he die?
- Drunk.

463
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,575
Where is your mother?

464
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,122
Where is your mother?

465
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:05,084
- Loony bin.
- Is she psychotic?

466
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:06,502
Yes.

467
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:09,255
- What is the name of your aunt?
- Bertha.

468
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,423
How did you come to have sex
with your Auntie Bertha?

469
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,926
- I was drunk and she looked good.
- And you did it again and again?

470
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:15,844
Yes.

471
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,930
Have you ever had bad thoughts
about Master Peggy?

472
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:19,765
- Yes.
- What did you think?

473
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,268
- I thought you were fools.
- Am I a fool to you?

474
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,936
- No, sir.
- If you were locked in a room

475
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:25,771
for the rest of your life,
who would be in there with you?

476
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:28,774
- Doris.
- Who's Doris?

477
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:31,694
Best girl I ever met.
The girl I'm going to marry one day.

478
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,279
- Is she in Lynn?
- Yes.

479
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:34,947
- Lynn, Massachusetts?
- Yes, sir.

480
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:37,616
- Then why aren't you with her?
- I'm an idiot.

481
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:41,203
- Why aren't you with that lovely girl?
- I got no reason. I'm a fool.

482
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,621
- Do you love Doris?
- Yes.

483
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:44,290
- Is she the love of your life?
- Yes, sir.

484
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,292
- Then why aren't you with her?
- I don't know.

485
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,794
Yes, you do. Tell me why you're not with her
if you love her so much.

486
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,879
I told her I'd come back,
and I never went back

487
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:52,631
and now I just-
I got to get back to her.

488
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,300
- Why don't you go back?
- I don't know.

489
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,759
- Why don't you go back?
- I don't know!

490
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:57,303
Close your eyes.

491
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:16,905
<i>Recall a word.</i>

492
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,117
<i>Flowers.</i>

493
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,166
<i>Can you recall what you're wearing?</i>

494
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,922
<i>Navy blues.</i>

495
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,430
<i>What do you hear?</i>

496
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,310
<i>Voices inside.</i>

497
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,439
Hello, Mrs. Solstad.

498
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,785
What made you come and see me?

499
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:05,871
I thought about you.

500
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,792
I thought about you when I was away.

501
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:13,003
I got your letter.

502
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:17,216
They have you write to soldiers at school?

503
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,387
I wrote to you.

504
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,893
How come you didn't write me back?

505
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,645
I don't know.

506
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:35,484
I did. I just- never sent it.

507
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:38,737
Are you going to Briar Cliff?

508
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:40,739
I'm not in college.

509
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:45,744
What are you, a senior?

510
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:47,746
- Junior?
- No.

511
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:50,874
- You're not a freshman.
- I'm a sophomore.

512
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:54,753
- So how old does that make you?
- Sixteen.

513
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,381
- Did you think I was older?
- No.

514
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,592
I don't really remember.

515
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:07,569
Can I kiss you?

516
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:26,118
<i>Recall a sound.</i>

517
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:31,039
She's singing.

518
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:27,513
Her voice settles me down.

519
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:46,949
I'm meant to go to Norway.

520
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:52,538
- When's this?
- November.

521
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,459
What for?

522
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,003
I'm going to meet the rest of our family.

523
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:06,510
Well, I don't think you should go.

524
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:16,144
No, you're not going to go.

525
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:19,690
I came all this way to see you,
and I want you to stay here.

526
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,904
All right.

527
00:48:28,574 --> 00:48:30,158
All right.

528
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:36,415
Can you recall a word?

529
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:40,919
Any word.

530
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:43,171
Away.

531
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,551
- Say it again.
- Away.

532
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:55,434
- Who's saying "away"?
- I am.

533
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,189
<i>Outbound for Shanghai!</i>

534
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:07,029
Need one able-bodied seaman,
one oiler and one baker.

535
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:08,739
The man McCoughsky.

536
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:11,617
The man Quell.

537
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:12,784
- Yeah.
- Oiler?

538
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,119
- Yes, sir.
- Done this before?

539
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:16,455
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow morning, 8:00.

540
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:23,712
- Hey.
- Hi.

541
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:26,882
Listen, I gotta go somewhere for a few months,

542
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:28,759
so you should go to Norway.

543
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:31,470
- Where are you going?
- I got a job that takes me away.

544
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:33,263
- Where?
- I don't know.

545
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,308
Don't ask me so many questions.
I don't know anyway.

546
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:40,896
You know, I didn't know which window was yours,
and I always guess right.

547
00:49:41,063 --> 00:49:43,774
You take your trip and come back home,

548
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,901
and that's gonna be our time, right?

549
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:48,153
That's gonna be our time.
That's gonna be our time, right?

550
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,446
- Yeah.
- Right? Say yes.

551
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:51,281
- Say yes.
- Yes.

552
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:01,917
I'll be back in a minute.

553
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:30,529
<i>Release and return to me.</i>

554
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,949
Open your eyes.

555
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,044
Say your name.

556
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:49,047
- Freddie Quell.
- Are you here with me in 1950?

557
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,674
Yes.

558
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:53,385
End of session.

559
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:04,187
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

560
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:07,691
- Left side of your body feel okay?
- Yes.

561
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:11,069
- Right side of your stomach?
- Yes.

562
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,114
- Headaches?
- A little.

563
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:17,576
Are you a member of the Hidden Rulers?

564
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:20,412
- I don't know what that is.
- Any communist organization?

565
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:21,538
No.

566
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:24,249
Any invader force on this planet
or anywhere else?

567
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,418
No, sir.

568
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:29,087
You are the bravest boy I've ever met.

569
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:47,939
To the poison.

570
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,043
Well done.

571
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,801
Kools.

572
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:25,977
I like Kools.

573
00:52:27,813 --> 00:52:29,439
Minty flavor.

574
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:32,609
Bill!

575
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:34,986
- Master, hello!
- Hello!

576
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:36,822
Welcome.

577
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,990
- Welcome back to New York City.
- Thank you.

578
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:42,327
- We are so happy you're here.
- I'm happy I'm here.

579
00:52:42,494 --> 00:52:45,247
Peggy, watch your step.

580
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,624
Watch your step, everyone.

581
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,584
- Hello, Mildred.
- Hello.

582
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,294
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

583
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:52,504
- Mildred.
- Oh, hello.

584
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,172
This is Mildred Drummond.

585
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:56,424
- Very nice to meet you.
- Wonderful to meet you finally.

586
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:57,843
- My pleasure.
- And-

587
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:59,678
The boat was perfect.

588
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:02,097
- Thank you. Peggy, my wife.
- Hello, Peggy.

589
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:04,182
Nice to meet you. And congratulations.

590
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:06,101
- Thank you.
- Freddie Quell.

591
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:08,020
Freddie... Quell.

592
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,857
- Elizabeth, my daughter.
- Yes.

593
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,984
- Hello. How are you?
- Clark, my son-in-law.

594
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,152
- Hello, Clark.
- Lovely to meet you.

595
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,529
- Lovely to meet you.
- Norman Conrad.

596
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:18,864
- Yes.
- How do you do?

597
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,657
- Cliff Boyd.
- Good evening.

598
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:22,868
- Val, my son.
- Oh, yes.

599
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,036
How are you?
I can see the resemblance.

600
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:28,790
- Yes, yes. So can I.
- Why don't you come with me?

601
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:31,668
I will introduce you to-

602
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,545
- Oh, well, here's Poppy.
- Poppy!

603
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:35,964
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Yes.

604
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,674
- And the lovely Brigitte.
- Brigitte!

605
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,528
- Here you are.
- Good evening. Scotch.

606
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:01,573
- Scotch, okay. Neat or on the rocks?
- Neat.

607
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,909
Neat. Two fingers?

608
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,577
Yeah, it's fine.

609
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,079
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

610
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:10,165
- Thank you, Clark. Thank you.
- Thank you.

611
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:14,836
- Would you like something?
- We have some delicious treats inside.

612
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:17,047
- In the back? Those sandwiches?
- In the back. Yes.

613
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:20,926
- And an Old Fashioned.
- Old Fashioned for me.

614
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:24,012
Do you want to stay together
or do you want to come with me?

615
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,597
I'll join you.

616
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:27,432
All right, come with me, Peggy.

617
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,935
- Thank you so much.
- This is my friend I want you to meet,

618
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,102
- Michelle.
- Hi. How are you?

619
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,466
Open your eyes, come back to me.

620
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,098
What is your name?

621
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:11,101
Margaret O'Brien.

622
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:15,146
What is your name?

623
00:55:21,987 --> 00:55:22,988
Well...

624
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,409
Now that you mention it...

625
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,789
I think I was a man.

626
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:34,749
Laughing is good.

627
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,546
- My neck feels much better.
- Oh, that's good.

628
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:45,677
What I just experienced,
was that me?

629
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:47,679
What was you, darling?

630
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:52,684
That man in the armor,
was that me?

631
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:54,686
Yes. That was your spirit.

632
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:58,106
Our spirits live on in the whole of time,

633
00:55:58,273 --> 00:56:02,527
exist in many vessels through time.

634
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:07,198
This is the vessel
you're existing in now, in 1950.

635
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:10,368
- Excuse me.
- As you all may recall,

636
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:15,790
during the trauma that you went through
while we were processing...

637
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:17,042
Yes.

638
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:21,671
it was of the utmost importance

639
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:24,966
that you experience every detail...

640
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,720
every specific detail

641
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:31,639
through all of your senses,
of that memory,

642
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,349
and that we go over it again

643
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,560
and over it again
and over it again

644
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:38,313
until it loses its power.
This is very-

645
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,151
- Excuse me.
- This is very important.

646
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:45,820
- Why it is important...
- Excuse me.

647
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:50,742
is if you bring someone
out of a traumatic event,

648
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:53,036
back to the present time,

649
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:56,164
- no matter how carefully you do that...
- Excuse me.

650
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:57,665
if you have not gone over the memory-

651
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,001
Excuse me. Excuse me.

652
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:04,881
Some of this sounds quite like hypnosis,
is it not?

653
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:08,927
This is a process of de-hypnotization,
if you will.

654
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:12,722
Man is asleep.
This process wakes him from his slumber.

655
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:16,601
I still find it difficult
to see the proof

656
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:20,772
with regards to past lives
that your movement claims.

657
00:57:20,939 --> 00:57:23,691
Would you care to submit yourself to processing?

658
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:26,361
"Look through the telescope,"
as my friend said.

659
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:28,613
Oh, perhaps another time.

660
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,741
You've also said that these methods,
Cause Methods,

661
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:34,869
can cure leukemia,
according to your book, and-

662
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:38,081
Some forms of leukemia.

663
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:40,250
In being able to access past lives,

664
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,253
we are able to treat illnesses
that may have started back

665
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,088
thousands, even trillions of years.

666
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:47,799
- Trillions?
- With a "T", sir.

667
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,761
The earth is not understood
to be more than a few billion years old.

668
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:56,266
Even the smartest of our current scientists
can be fooled, yes.

669
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:58,143
- You can understand skepticism...
- Yes!

670
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:01,312
- can you not?
- Yes, yes.

671
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:05,400
For without it, we'd be positives and no negatives,
therefore zero charge.

672
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:08,486
- We must have it.
- Good science by definition

673
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:10,321
allows for more than one opinion,
does it not?

674
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,574
Which is why our gathering of data
is so far-reaching.

675
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,492
Otherwise, you merely have
the will of one man,

676
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:18,246
which is the basis of cult, is it not?

677
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:20,123
'Tis, 'tis...

678
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,084
and thankfully, we are, all of us,
working at breakneck speeds

679
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:25,795
and in unison towards capturing
the mind's fatal flaws

680
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:29,841
and correcting it back
to its inherent state of perfect.

681
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,012
Whilst righting civilization
and eliminating war and poverty,

682
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,848
and therefore, the atomic threat.

683
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,810
Well...

684
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:43,313
I find it quite difficult to comprehend,

685
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:47,483
or more to the point, believe,
that you believe, sir,

686
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,986
that time travel hypnosis therapy

687
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:52,488
can bring world peace and cure cancer.

688
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,449
I have never been to the pyramids,
have you?

689
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:58,119
- No.
- And yet we know that they are there

690
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,371
because learned men have told us so.

691
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:02,332
May I ask, what is your name?

692
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:07,212
- John More.
- Mr. More, if I may,

693
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:11,174
is there something frightening to you
about The Cause's travels into the past?

694
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:13,301
- Frightening? No, no.
- Yes.

695
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:16,888
What scares you so much
about traveling into the past, sir?

696
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:18,806
- I'm not frightened.
- Are you afraid that we might discover

697
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,684
that our past has been reshapen?

698
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,188
Perverted?

699
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:27,649
And perhaps what we think
we know of this world

700
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:29,985
is false information?

701
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:33,071
Time travel does not frighten me, sir,
because it's not possible.

702
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:35,907
What does frighten me is the possibility
of some poor soul with leukemia

703
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:37,533
- coming to you-
- There are dangers

704
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,578
of traveling in and out of time
as we understand it.

705
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,705
But it's not unlike traveling
down a river, you see?

706
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:45,250
You travel down the river,
'round the bend, look back,

707
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:47,252
and you cannot see around the bend,
can you?

708
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:49,587
But that does not mean
it is not there, does it?

709
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:53,549
But certain clubs would like us
to think that a truth,

710
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:57,095
I say truth, uncovered should stay hidden.

711
00:59:57,262 --> 01:00:01,557
I belong to no club,
and if you're unwilling to allow any discussion-

712
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:05,103
No, this isn't a discussion, it's a grilling.

713
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,189
There's nothing I can do for you
if your mind has been made up.

714
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:11,442
You seem to know the answers to your questions.
Why do you ask?

715
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:14,070
I'm sorry you're unwilling
to defend your beliefs

716
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:17,156
- in any kind of rational-
- If you already

717
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:20,618
know the answers to your questions,
then why ask, pig fuck?!

718
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,253
We are not helpless.

719
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,841
And we are on a journey
that risks the dark.

720
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,261
If you don't mind,
a good night to you.

721
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,726
Freddie, stop!

722
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:48,396
This is not the time. Stop.

723
01:00:56,979 --> 01:00:58,975
And this is where we are at.

724
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:05,580
At the lowest level to have
to explain ourselves, for what?

725
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:08,166
For what we do we have to grovel?

726
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:12,337
The only way to defend ourselves
is to attack.

727
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:16,174
If we don't do that, we will lose
every battle that we are engaged in.

728
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,843
We will never dominate our environment

729
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,929
the way we should unless we attack.

730
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:28,019
And this city, city is just noise.

731
01:01:28,186 --> 01:01:30,021
I know this city.

732
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:34,359
I know its rotten secrets,
its filthy lies and secrets.

733
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:40,365
They- invited us here and welcomed us.

734
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:45,620
Only to throw us down
and kick us out.

735
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:49,957
It's a grim joke.

736
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:14,023
You got the names and information
of the people at this party, right?

737
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,360
- You invited them?
- Yeah, what for?

738
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:24,409
All right, Clark.
Get up, you're coming with me.

739
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:30,164
Hey, I need some help. You want to put
on a good show or no? Let's go. Come on.

740
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:42,427
Yes, who is it?

741
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:45,179
Mr. More, this is Freddie Quell
from The Cause.

742
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:47,890
I'd like to have a word.

743
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:51,269
Mr. Quell, it's 3:00 in the morning.

744
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:54,230
Yes, sir, we have a gift
we'd like to present to you.

745
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:58,443
You'd like to present to me?
How do you- know where I live?

746
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,947
Can we come in, just have a word?

747
01:03:03,114 --> 01:03:05,199
How about if we do it right in the doorway.
How does that sound?

748
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:06,618
Sure...

749
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:10,037
Shit!

750
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:11,873
Jesus! Hey!

751
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:19,380
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

752
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,808
Well, I don't think you have
to worry about Mr. John More

753
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,977
speaking out against you.

754
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:38,149
What did you do?

755
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,612
He had a wise ass mouth.

756
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:45,656
My little soldier, what did you do?

757
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:49,076
- You need to tell me so that I know.
- No, I'm not going to tell you.

758
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:52,163
Nothing bad.

759
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:56,501
I just- I just talked to him.

760
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,628
But this is not the way.

761
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,464
Naughty boy, okay?

762
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:04,342
All right? Freddie?

763
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,679
You are a mischief.

764
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:12,350
A horrible young man, you are.

765
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:15,019
This is acting like an animal,

766
01:04:15,186 --> 01:04:18,189
a dirty animal that eats
its own feces when hungry.

767
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:21,817
We stand far above that crowd.

768
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:28,199
Don't we?

769
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:34,789
- Well-
- We need to remember where we've met.

770
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:36,832
It's nagging at me.

771
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:38,960
Isn't it you?

772
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:47,552
Thank you. Thank you.

773
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:53,391
Thank you. Down, but not out.

774
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:58,020
No, not dead yet.

775
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:02,567
- Hello!
- Hello!

776
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:07,321
Welcome to Philadelphia!

777
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:11,909
- Everyone all right?
- I'm gonna race you!

778
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,413
You win!

779
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:19,750
You won, you won.

780
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:22,086
- Peggy, Elizabeth.
- Hello.

781
01:05:22,253 --> 01:05:23,212
Clark.

782
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:28,384
<i>When we travel back
in the Time Hole,</i>

783
01:05:28,551 --> 01:05:31,387
there's a different feel
to another period in time

784
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:36,100
that is so basic it's hard to describe.

785
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:40,271
So if you find yourself in a room...

786
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:49,280
allow that there may be color
with unfamiliar tones,

787
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,407
perhaps because the gaslight shining on it.

788
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:59,290
There may be a strange quality to the air.

789
01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:03,419
Its particles of dust derive
from un-modern constituents.

790
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:10,301
Even human bodies seem to radiate
a different kind of warmth

791
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:14,805
when covered with the fabrics of another age.

792
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:18,768
Now, memory filters all of that out.

793
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:24,815
But... when we return this way,

794
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:29,153
the Cause Way, the way Master has discovered,

795
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,989
everything is intact.

796
01:06:34,283 --> 01:06:36,410
With such gratitude.

797
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,130
Thank you.

798
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:50,966
What a welcome to Philadelphia.

799
01:06:55,513 --> 01:06:57,074
I'm in love.

800
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:06,357
I'm in love.
We've all been in love.

801
01:07:06,524 --> 01:07:10,528
And when we're in love,
we experience pleasure...

802
01:07:12,488 --> 01:07:13,698
and extreme pain.

803
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,868
And that's what I'd like to talk about.

804
01:07:30,506 --> 01:07:32,133
<i>"Go Roving."</i>

805
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:34,343
"Go Roving" in "G."

806
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,797
Sotto voce.

807
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:29,334
Everyone!

808
01:09:49,854 --> 01:09:51,188
Yes.

809
01:10:03,868 --> 01:10:06,495
You can do whatever you want...

810
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:09,540
as long as I don't find out.

811
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:17,214
And as long as no one that I know
knows about it.

812
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,926
Other than that...

813
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:24,471
stop with this idea.

814
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:27,892
Put it back in its pants.

815
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:32,396
It didn't work for them,
and it's not going to work for you.

816
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:35,566
We have enough problems as it is, okay?

817
01:10:35,733 --> 01:10:37,902
- Can you come for me?
- Oh, yes.

818
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,194
- Come for me.
- Oh, yes.

819
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:40,571
Best behavior out.

820
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:42,239
- Come for me?
- Yes.

821
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,533
- And no more of that boy's hooch.
- No more hooch.

822
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,910
- Say it again.
- No more hooch.

823
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:47,138
Come for me.

824
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:55,790
Yes.

825
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:16,273
Freddie, wake up.

826
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,525
Come on. Wake up.

827
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:21,904
Come on. Get yourself up.

828
01:11:22,071 --> 01:11:23,906
- Wake up. Come on.
- Wait.

829
01:11:24,073 --> 01:11:26,075
God. Yeah, come on.

830
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:28,577
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

831
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:30,412
Wake up. Nothing's the matter.

832
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:33,540
I'm here to help you with something.

833
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:35,876
- Wake up. Are you awake?
- I'm up!

834
01:11:37,211 --> 01:11:38,462
- You awake?
- Yes.

835
01:11:38,629 --> 01:11:39,781
Look at me.

836
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:46,971
Freddie, I want you to place something
in the future for yourself.

837
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:51,976
I want you to place something
in the future for yourself

838
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:54,311
that you would like to have.

839
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:57,815
And tell me when it's done.

840
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,902
Okay.

841
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:04,822
Now, it's there waiting for you,

842
01:12:04,989 --> 01:12:09,159
and you can go and get it
whenever you're ready.

843
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:12,663
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

844
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:18,293
You can't stay with us anymore
unless you quit boozing.

845
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,504
All right.

846
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,842
- Now tell me.
- What?

847
01:12:25,009 --> 01:12:30,806
- Tell me that you will quit boozing.
- I'll quit boozing.

848
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,267
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

849
01:12:33,434 --> 01:12:37,354
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

850
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:40,691
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

851
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,362
You know you should wake up, Val.

852
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,323
Your father's speaking,
you might learn something.

853
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:35,370
He's making all this up
as he goes along.

854
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:38,165
You don't see that?

855
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:41,585
I can sleep and wake up
and not have missed one thing.

856
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:49,051
- You got something to say to me?
- No, sir.

857
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:51,929
Well, you should have.

858
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:56,058
You should say something.
Do something.

859
01:13:56,225 --> 01:13:59,061
Say "fuck you." Be a man!

860
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:12,407
Okay, you're all right.

861
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,952
You're fine, you're fine, okay?

862
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:17,204
Sit down and shut up.

863
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:23,961
Good afternoon.

864
01:14:24,128 --> 01:14:26,755
Come home. You're late.

865
01:14:27,798 --> 01:14:30,092
It's a beautiful house.
Are you the owner?

866
01:14:30,259 --> 01:14:33,137
- No, sir.
- Is that how your mother said it?

867
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,305
We're looking for Lancaster Dodd.

868
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:38,308
- I don't know who that is.
- He's in the house.

869
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:40,561
- Well, may I come in?
- He's just inside. Yes, come in.

870
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,980
- Now hold on.
- Are you the owner?

871
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:44,481
No, sir.

872
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,817
Well, I have a civil warrant here

873
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:49,153
- for a Lancaster Dodd.
- You're late.

874
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,155
Release and return to present time.

875
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:52,823
- Excuse me, Kim.
- The owner's in the house.

876
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,032
May I come in?

877
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:55,742
No, you can't.
We're gonna have to talk to-

878
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:57,077
- He's just inside.
- I have a warrant here

879
01:14:57,244 --> 01:14:58,996
to serve Lancaster Dodd.
A civil warrant.

880
01:14:59,163 --> 01:15:00,831
What's happening here?

881
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:03,000
Good afternoon.
Are you Lancaster Dodd?

882
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,835
Good afternoon. Yes, I am.

883
01:15:06,003 --> 01:15:08,005
I have a warrant for your arrest, sir.

884
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:11,508
Goody. What are the charges?

885
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:14,428
By the district court of Pennsylvania,

886
01:15:14,595 --> 01:15:16,513
The Mildred Drummond Foundation

887
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,307
for wrongful withdrawal of funds.

888
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:20,184
This is a silly joke, no?

889
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,102
- No, it isn't, sir.
- This is-

890
01:15:22,269 --> 01:15:24,104
I have to take you in
and book and fingerprint you.

891
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:25,480
comic opera.

892
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,816
Is it illegal in this city
to get better?

893
01:15:27,983 --> 01:15:31,028
No, but it's illegal to operate
a medical school without a license.

894
01:15:31,195 --> 01:15:33,030
This is not a medical school,
it's a house.

895
01:15:33,197 --> 01:15:35,157
Sir, this is my home
and these are my guests.

896
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:37,367
Ma'am, this is the City of
Philadelphia Police Department.

897
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:40,329
We have no disagreement with these boys
doing their work and all its silliness

898
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:42,039
as defenders of what code?

899
01:15:42,206 --> 01:15:44,041
Well, we're with the City of
Philadelphia Police Department.

900
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:47,336
- What honor?! What honor do you have?!
- State of Pennsylvania, sir.

901
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,713
- Put your hands behind your back.
- What part of the galaxy-?

902
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:53,550
This is a scientific gathering.

903
01:15:55,636 --> 01:15:57,721
Freddie! No, no, no, no, no.

904
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:59,723
- Calm down!
- No! Freddie!

905
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,142
Freddie! Calm down! No!

906
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:04,186
Calm down! Do not hurt him!

907
01:16:06,146 --> 01:16:07,439
Freddie!

908
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:10,234
It'll be okay!
Please, don't hurt him!

909
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,153
- I am with you, Daddy.
- You'll be out in no time.

910
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,656
We'll be- we'll be out shortly!

911
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:17,009
Just laugh!

912
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:25,082
- Just laugh.
- Everyone's laughing.

913
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:27,251
- Not you.
- I'll bring him to the station.

914
01:16:29,002 --> 01:16:30,754
We're following right behind.
We'll be right there.

915
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:33,090
- Okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay.
- We're following right behind you.

916
01:16:33,257 --> 01:16:36,260
- I'm with you, Daddy.
- I'm fine. I love you!

917
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:37,928
Love you, too!

918
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:41,325
Your fear of capture and imprisonment

919
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,827
is an implant from millions of years ago.

920
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:53,128
This battle has been with you
from before you know.

921
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:56,673
This is not you.

922
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,592
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's not you.

923
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:01,678
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's not you.

924
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,432
You are asleep.

925
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,271
Your spirit was free...

926
01:18:11,438 --> 01:18:15,025
moving from body to the next body, free...

927
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:17,027
Free for a moment.

928
01:18:17,194 --> 01:18:19,363
Then it was captured by an invader force

929
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:21,323
bent on turning you to the darkest way.

930
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,617
You've been implanted
with a push-pull mechanism

931
01:18:23,784 --> 01:18:28,205
that keeps you fearful of authority
and destructive.

932
01:18:28,372 --> 01:18:31,208
We are in the middle of a battle
that's a trillion years in the making,

933
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:34,294
- and it's bigger than the both of us.
- You're making this shit up!

934
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:36,588
You make this shit up!

935
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:38,715
You don't know what you're talking about.

936
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,009
I don't know what I'm talking about?

937
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:42,677
No, you don't.

938
01:18:44,346 --> 01:18:46,056
I give you facts.

939
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:48,392
- You don't give me facts!
- They are not opinions.

940
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,852
- What facts? What facts?
- They are fucking facts!

941
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:52,521
- What facts? What facts?
- Fuck you!

942
01:18:52,687 --> 01:18:54,564
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

943
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,483
- Why don't you kick the bed some more?
- Fuck you!

944
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,527
- Fuck you, you lazy ass piece of shit!
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

945
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,028
- I'm not lazy!
- I'm done!

946
01:19:00,195 --> 01:19:02,572
- You're fucking lazy!
- Oh, you make shit up-

947
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:05,200
- You're fuckin' lazy!
- Your fucking family hates you!

948
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,160
- Your son hates you!
- Oh, they do?

949
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:09,746
- Yeah! Your son hates you.
- Who fucking likes you except for me?

950
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:11,540
- Nobody!
- Except for me.

951
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:14,501
- No, you don't fucking like me.
- Who likes you except for me?

952
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,627
Shut up!

953
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:17,712
- Except for me?
- You, shut up!

954
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:19,589
- I'm the only one who likes you.
- Fuck you!

955
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:21,258
- Fuck you, too!
- Fuck you!

956
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:22,926
Fuck you!

957
01:19:23,093 --> 01:19:25,762
- Just me, Freddie.
- Just you?

958
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,014
I'm the only one that likes you.

959
01:19:32,394 --> 01:19:34,020
The only one.

960
01:19:35,272 --> 01:19:38,525
You're a fucking drunk.

961
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:41,445
And I'm done with you.
Fucking-

962
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:02,924
- Mr. Dodd?
- Yes?

963
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:05,760
You're hereby ordered to pay back $11,000

964
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:08,889
to the Mildred Drummond Foundation
no later than June first,

965
01:20:09,055 --> 01:20:11,141
otherwise to incur penalties of interest.

966
01:20:11,308 --> 01:20:14,603
There's also the matter of
$1,500 in fuel and damages

967
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:19,107
to Mrs. Drummond's sailing yacht,
that shall be repaid on the same date.

968
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:44,841
- Dad?
- Yes?

969
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:51,848
I don't think Freddie's as committed
to The Cause as The Cause is to him.

970
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:58,522
When I told Freddie about
your unpublished work...

971
01:21:00,524 --> 01:21:03,527
his question to me was...

972
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:06,613
"What is something like that worth?"

973
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:11,451
I think Freddie Quell's a spy.

974
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:16,665
Perhaps working for some outside agency,

975
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:21,086
or the man's working for himself.

976
01:21:21,253 --> 01:21:25,465
To steal and sell your book
to any dissenters who may want it.

977
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:32,389
"How do we know who he is?"
is perhaps the question.

978
01:21:34,724 --> 01:21:37,561
And "What is the reason he is here
if he is past help?"

979
01:21:44,568 --> 01:21:46,695
He makes me nervous.

980
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,199
I think he wants me.

981
01:21:51,366 --> 01:21:53,535
I think he's in love with me.

982
01:21:58,248 --> 01:22:02,711
I wonder how he got here,
and what he's after.

983
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:06,506
Is it really all so easy
that he just came across us?

984
01:22:06,673 --> 01:22:09,259
He's a drunk, and he's dangerous.

985
01:22:09,426 --> 01:22:12,554
And he will be our undoing
if we continue to have him here.

986
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,022
Thank you...

987
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:24,941
all of you...

988
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:27,569
for your honesty.

989
01:22:31,615 --> 01:22:32,866
But...

990
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:38,288
if we are not helping him,

991
01:22:38,455 --> 01:22:42,417
then it is we who have failed him.

992
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,297
'Tis it not?

993
01:22:50,342 --> 01:22:51,926
Perhaps he's past help.

994
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,639
Or insane.

995
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,311
Thank you, truly.

996
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:02,854
Thank you.

997
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,649
Food for thought.

998
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,492
There you go.

999
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,664
Almost. 

1000
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:17,053
Freddie, stand in the middle of the room, please.

1001
01:24:25,019 --> 01:24:29,691
Pick a spot over there, touch it,
and describe it to me.

1002
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:37,198
It's wood, wall.

1003
01:24:37,365 --> 01:24:41,119
Fine, fine.
Walk to this window over here.

1004
01:24:41,286 --> 01:24:44,164
Touch a spot on the window
and describe it to me.

1005
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,002
It just feels like glass.

1006
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:51,004
Well, that's because it is glass.

1007
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:54,007
Describe it.
Describe it the best you can.

1008
01:24:54,174 --> 01:24:57,844
- Well, it's smooth.
- Right.

1009
01:24:58,011 --> 01:25:01,347
It's warm, warmer than the wood,
because the sun's coming through.

1010
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:02,849
Very good.

1011
01:25:04,434 --> 01:25:08,563
Very good.
Now, walk to that wall again, touch a spot.

1012
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:10,440
Close your eyes.

1013
01:25:10,607 --> 01:25:12,776
Close your eyes.

1014
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:15,945
<i>This exercise will help you
with your concentration.</i>

1015
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:18,531
What color are my eyes?

1016
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,327
Green.

1017
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,622
Turn them blue.

1018
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:31,628
A Ferris wheel?

1019
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:33,421
That's beautiful. Back again.

1020
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:36,257
Faster, please.

1021
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:40,053
Could we move that back?

1022
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,263
- It's a fucking wall!
- Could we move that back, please?

1023
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:45,391
I feel it! It's wood!

1024
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:48,478
Turn them black.

1025
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:52,816
What color are my eyes?

1026
01:25:54,984 --> 01:25:56,736
Black.

1027
01:25:59,322 --> 01:26:00,824
Very good.

1028
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:06,746
What we will do now
will urge you toward existence

1029
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:10,917
within a group, society or family.

1030
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:14,712
This is called Application 45, Version 1.

1031
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:21,177
No matter what is said between the subjects,
we do not react.

1032
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:24,347
- Okay.
- No matter what is said.

1033
01:26:26,766 --> 01:26:29,018
And you must look at the subject.

1034
01:26:29,185 --> 01:26:31,479
You must look at the subject.

1035
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:33,940
All right?

1036
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:36,359
One minute.

1037
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:40,947
Clark, you may begin.

1038
01:26:43,366 --> 01:26:44,784
Doris.

1039
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:49,622
- Fail.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1040
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:51,040
Fail.

1041
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:54,168
It's the same fucking wall.

1042
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:57,338
Nothing. Nothing.
That's what I feel, nothing.

1043
01:26:57,505 --> 01:27:01,342
All right. Lunch on the veranda today.

1044
01:27:01,509 --> 01:27:03,553
So, if you could all move,
except for you, Freddie.

1045
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,471
Back again, please?

1046
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,808
Everyone.

1047
01:27:08,975 --> 01:27:10,643
Beautiful day.

1048
01:27:14,856 --> 01:27:16,316
Well, luckily, I don't care.

1049
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:19,152
- Doris, Doris, Doris, Doris, Doris.
- Doris.

1050
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:21,055
See, it doesn't even affect me.

1051
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:24,741
Doris. Say it.

1052
01:27:24,908 --> 01:27:26,326
- Doris.
- Doris.

1053
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,244
- Doris.
- Doris, see?

1054
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:29,412
You miss her?

1055
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:30,496
Do you miss Doris?

1056
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,583
Say her fucking name again,
I swear to God.

1057
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,710
- Doris.
- I swear to fucking God!

1058
01:27:35,877 --> 01:27:37,337
Doris.

1059
01:27:38,922 --> 01:27:43,593
Doris, Doris, Doris.

1060
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,262
This is difficult for you.

1061
01:27:49,057 --> 01:27:51,601
Listen.

1062
01:27:51,768 --> 01:27:54,771
"'It's really a damn shame to tease you so,
my little whore,' he laughed,

1063
01:27:54,938 --> 01:27:58,024
'so, I will get the dildo
out of my cabinet in the next room.'

1064
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:01,110
He was scarcely gone many seconds
before he returned,

1065
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:04,113
and I felt his fingers
opening the lips of my cunt.

1066
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,283
'Oh, oh, who is that?'
I screamed from under my skirt."

1067
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:08,701
I don't want to hear any of this.

1068
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:12,455
Just listen. No reaction.

1069
01:28:12,622 --> 01:28:16,250
"Kiss her. Put your tongue in her mouth, my boy.

1070
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:19,963
Fuck, fuck, fuck away."

1071
01:28:23,466 --> 01:28:25,802
Rocks, covered in moss.

1072
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:33,643
Fields, running around, barbed wire.

1073
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:40,775
Open, storm...

1074
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:45,989
Apples. Daddy, can you pass the apples, please?

1075
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:49,659
Cold, out at night.

1076
01:28:49,826 --> 01:28:53,121
Meadow... open.

1077
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:54,831
Back again!

1078
01:28:57,291 --> 01:29:02,171
- It's a hard, slow process.
- I just don't understand it.

1079
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:06,092
I don't either. That's why we're here.

1080
01:29:16,019 --> 01:29:18,855
Do not do that, please?

1081
01:29:19,022 --> 01:29:21,858
Resume the exercise,
no matter what is said.

1082
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:26,821
- What?
- You may talk to Clark.

1083
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:29,949
One minute.

1084
01:29:30,116 --> 01:29:32,035
Whatever comes to your mind.

1085
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:34,037
True or false.

1086
01:29:35,705 --> 01:29:37,874
I don't want to say anything.

1087
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:41,210
Then don't say anything.
Just look at him. One minute.

1088
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:43,880
Starting now.

1089
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:55,808
I wanna fart in your face.

1090
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,733
I wish I could fart,
because I'd fart in your face right now.

1091
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:14,577
Wallpaper.

1092
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,085
I don't know, this is getting really hard.

1093
01:30:29,884 --> 01:30:32,220
Okay, all right.

1094
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:34,514
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1095
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,724
I don't know.

1096
01:30:36,891 --> 01:30:39,435
How is this helping?

1097
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:42,355
You'll see.

1098
01:30:45,942 --> 01:30:49,862
Doris. She got rid of you, right?

1099
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:55,034
She saw you for what you are:
selfish and alone.

1100
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:59,205
You should go into the hospital
with your mother,

1101
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:01,582
because that's where you belong.

1102
01:31:01,749 --> 01:31:04,794
Because you're sick, and you're tired,

1103
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:08,256
and you need to be alone,
away from people.

1104
01:31:26,774 --> 01:31:28,985
<i>How many people you kill, dummy?</i>

1105
01:31:30,653 --> 01:31:33,239
<i>Are you drunk, dummy?</i>

1106
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:35,575
<i>Did you blow them all up
and burn them?</i>

1107
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:39,996
<i>Dummy, dummy, dummy.</i>

1108
01:31:41,622 --> 01:31:43,624
Can you stay still, dummy?

1109
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:47,795
Can you, dum-dum?

1110
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:50,798
Are you a loser?

1111
01:31:50,965 --> 01:31:53,176
You lunkhead.

1112
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:02,018
Fail.

1113
01:32:02,185 --> 01:32:04,770
- But-
- Fail.

1114
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,480
Mannequin...

1115
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:40,306
It's a fucking wall!

1116
01:32:40,473 --> 01:32:43,476
It's a fucking wall.
It's a fucking wall.

1117
01:32:43,643 --> 01:32:46,729
It's a fucking wall.
And I'm not in it.

1118
01:32:46,896 --> 01:32:50,900
I'm not in it. It's a window
and I can leave any time I want.

1119
01:32:51,067 --> 01:32:53,986
But I choose not to.
I choose to stay here.

1120
01:33:06,582 --> 01:33:08,584
It's breathing.

1121
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:37,697
<i>No matter what is said,
we do not react.</i>

1122
01:33:38,781 --> 01:33:40,783
Freddie, you may begin.

1123
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:49,083
I was on a ship that got 13 battle stars
and won the war.

1124
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,294
What'd you do, dummy?

1125
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:04,307
<i>I can feel outside,
I can touch the neighbor's house.</i>

1126
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:08,769
I can touch the plants,
I can touch the stars,

1127
01:34:08,936 --> 01:34:11,147
I can touch anything I want.

1128
01:34:13,149 --> 01:34:15,067
And end of Application.

1129
01:34:18,237 --> 01:34:20,156
- You're fucking with me.
- End of Application.

1130
01:34:20,323 --> 01:34:23,117
- Freddie, open your eyes.
- It's a fucking wall!

1131
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:25,995
Open your eyes and come back to me.

1132
01:34:42,261 --> 01:34:43,596
Very good.

1133
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:48,768
Very good.

1134
01:35:01,989 --> 01:35:06,035
I am here to announce the first
Universal Congress of The Cause

1135
01:35:06,202 --> 01:35:11,832
to be held May 21st, 1950,
in Phoenix, Arizona,

1136
01:35:11,999 --> 01:35:14,126
a city named for that glorious bird,

1137
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:18,381
whose resurrection from the ashes fits our own.

1138
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:21,675
And it is here we will present Book II.

1139
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,307
What's in it?

1140
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:56,896
My unpublished work.

1141
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,275
My life's work.

1142
01:37:07,656 --> 01:37:10,409
Hold on. Hold on.

1143
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:25,674
All right.

1144
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:01,001
Please, come and join us.

1145
01:38:01,168 --> 01:38:04,838
Please, come get insight on
how to be freer, more productive,

1146
01:38:05,005 --> 01:38:08,050
and more in command of your life.

1147
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:10,803
- Free yourself, ma'am.
- Don't-

1148
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:14,723
Free yourself from past trauma.
Take command of your life, sir.

1149
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:16,892
Would you care for some free processing?

1150
01:38:18,978 --> 01:38:22,189
Sir, would you care for some free processing?
It's free.

1151
01:38:22,356 --> 01:38:24,024
Free yourself from past traumas.

1152
01:38:24,191 --> 01:38:26,068
Free yourself from past trauma.

1153
01:38:26,235 --> 01:38:27,570
Free yourself from past trauma.

1154
01:38:27,736 --> 01:38:29,196
Take control of your life.

1155
01:38:29,363 --> 01:38:31,156
Free yourself from your ailments.

1156
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:33,325
Free yourself from your ailments.

1157
01:38:33,492 --> 01:38:34,910
Take control of your life, sir.

1158
01:38:35,077 --> 01:38:37,079
Take control of your life.

1159
01:38:37,246 --> 01:38:39,248
You don't have to change your faith

1160
01:38:39,415 --> 01:38:41,834
or leave the congregation you belong to.

1161
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:44,837
So those interested in freedom
are urged to please come

1162
01:38:45,004 --> 01:38:48,757
for free sample processing sessions
in being younger, feeling freer,

1163
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:51,051
and understanding where you come from.

1164
01:38:51,218 --> 01:38:53,095
It works.

1165
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:55,490
I added that.

1166
01:38:57,933 --> 01:39:00,185
- Okay, ready?
- Is it in focus?

1167
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,480
I was just asking.

1168
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:06,275
- Go ahead, snap away.
- Okay.

1169
01:39:06,442 --> 01:39:07,901
Ready?

1170
01:39:08,861 --> 01:39:10,779
One, two...

1171
01:39:33,302 --> 01:39:34,720
Thank you.

1172
01:40:39,702 --> 01:40:41,286
Hi, Helen.

1173
01:40:41,995 --> 01:40:43,539
It's almost here.

1174
01:41:44,057 --> 01:41:45,893
That's enough.

1175
01:41:49,772 --> 01:41:51,190
That's enough now.

1176
01:41:51,356 --> 01:41:53,358
You're gonna make me red all over.

1177
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:57,696
Thank you. Thank you.

1178
01:41:58,906 --> 01:42:02,910
Book II... is about man.

1179
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:09,291
And the title of the book
is <i>The Split Saber.</i>

1180
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:12,961
And here we have some answers.

1181
01:42:14,046 --> 01:42:15,964
No more secrets.

1182
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:22,763
The source of all creation...

1183
01:42:25,307 --> 01:42:27,100
good and evil...

1184
01:42:28,602 --> 01:42:30,395
and the source of all...

1185
01:42:31,772 --> 01:42:36,318
now, funny enough, the source of all...

1186
01:42:38,237 --> 01:42:39,738
is you.

1187
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:52,417
I have unlocked... and discovered

1188
01:42:52,584 --> 01:42:57,673
a secret to living in these bodies
that we hold.

1189
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:06,015
And- oh, yes, it's very, very,
very, very serious.

1190
01:43:10,269 --> 01:43:11,520
The secret...

1191
01:43:13,146 --> 01:43:14,690
is laughter.

1192
01:43:25,117 --> 01:43:28,370
Now, I'd like to discuss
processing and communication.

1193
01:43:30,038 --> 01:43:32,040
The art of listening, if you will.

1194
01:44:10,245 --> 01:44:11,830
Bill.

1195
01:44:12,414 --> 01:44:13,749
Hello.

1196
01:44:17,169 --> 01:44:19,713
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1197
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:26,053
- You came from New York?
- New York City, yes.

1198
01:44:29,723 --> 01:44:31,934
So, what do you think of the book?

1199
01:44:36,939 --> 01:44:39,191
What do you think about it?

1200
01:44:39,358 --> 01:44:41,401
I think it stinks.

1201
01:44:41,568 --> 01:44:44,446
If it were up to me I'd chop this thing down
to a three-page pamphlet

1202
01:44:44,613 --> 01:44:47,407
and hand it to people
before they got on the subway.

1203
01:44:47,574 --> 01:44:49,284
But I edited most of his earlier work.

1204
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:50,494
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1205
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:52,204
- Outside?
- Let me say this,

1206
01:44:52,371 --> 01:44:54,706
the man is a grade-A mystic.

1207
01:44:54,873 --> 01:44:58,585
A true, original mystic of the highest order.

1208
01:44:58,752 --> 01:45:03,924
But his work is garbled and twisted,
and let me tell you...

1209
01:45:10,389 --> 01:45:13,475
What- What is this?

1210
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,525
- Hello.
- Helen.

1211
01:46:03,692 --> 01:46:06,361
- Author.
- Please.

1212
01:46:06,528 --> 01:46:09,865
- I've been reading the new book.
- What do you think?

1213
01:46:10,032 --> 01:46:12,284
I think it's wonderful.

1214
01:46:12,451 --> 01:46:14,828
- Wait till you get to the good parts.
- Oh, yes.

1215
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:22,377
Well, as I've begun,
I did notice on page 13 there's a change.

1216
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:27,174
You've changed the processing-platform question.

1217
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,885
Now it says, "Can you imagine...?"

1218
01:46:33,805 --> 01:46:34,890
Yes.

1219
01:46:36,349 --> 01:46:37,976
Yes.

1220
01:46:39,686 --> 01:46:44,816
If our previous method was to induce memory
by asking, "Can you recall,"

1221
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:47,569
doesn't it then change everything
if now we say, "Can you imagine?"

1222
01:46:47,736 --> 01:46:52,824
We are invoking a new,
wider range to account for the new data.

1223
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:58,830
"Can you imagine," allows for a more
creative pathway to the mind.

1224
01:46:58,997 --> 01:47:00,582
More open.

1225
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:04,544
- But if the new-
- What do you want?!

1226
01:47:05,837 --> 01:47:07,422
Helen.

1227
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:12,803
This is the new work.

1228
01:47:40,038 --> 01:47:41,623
Over here!

1229
01:47:45,085 --> 01:47:47,712
The game is called Pick-a-Point.

1230
01:47:47,879 --> 01:47:53,301
You pick a point, drive straight at it,
as fast as you can.

1231
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:55,637
I'll go first.

1232
01:47:55,804 --> 01:47:58,723
I pick that winding road.

1233
01:48:24,499 --> 01:48:26,459
Good job, Daddy!

1234
01:49:04,372 --> 01:49:05,874
Thrilling!

1235
01:49:08,742 --> 01:49:10,045
Thrilling.

1236
01:49:13,715 --> 01:49:15,050
Freddie.

1237
01:49:19,304 --> 01:49:20,805
Pick a point.

1238
01:49:20,972 --> 01:49:22,641
Tell it to me.

1239
01:49:25,685 --> 01:49:28,396
The rock- the mountain.

1240
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:30,398
The head.

1241
01:49:30,565 --> 01:49:32,359
It's the head of an alligator.

1242
01:49:32,525 --> 01:49:33,985
Good.

1243
01:50:06,267 --> 01:50:08,395
Freddie! Go, Freddie!

1244
01:50:31,543 --> 01:50:34,045
He's going very fast.

1245
01:50:37,948 --> 01:50:39,301
Good boy.

1246
01:51:05,452 --> 01:51:07,162
Freddie!

1247
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:17,833
Hello?

1248
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,235
Hello?

1249
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:27,659
Mrs. Solstad, I'm looking for Doris.

1250
01:52:30,912 --> 01:52:32,747
- What for?
- Because I'm looking for her,

1251
01:52:32,914 --> 01:52:35,250
because I want to talk to her.
That's what for.

1252
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:38,753
Well, Doris is in Alabama right now.

1253
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:44,426
- What's she doing in Alabama?
- Well, she's there with... Jim Day.

1254
01:52:44,592 --> 01:52:48,721
They're married.
He's in ROTC training, Navy flight training.

1255
01:52:48,888 --> 01:52:50,082
Jim Day?

1256
01:52:50,849 --> 01:52:53,101
- Jim Day, Jim Day, that Jim Day?
- Yes.

1257
01:52:53,268 --> 01:52:56,938
- Jim Day from Somerville.
- Well, when'd that happen?

1258
01:52:57,105 --> 01:53:00,108
They've been married for three years.

1259
01:53:00,275 --> 01:53:02,527
Is he still ugly?

1260
01:53:03,945 --> 01:53:05,947
She has two children.

1261
01:53:07,532 --> 01:53:09,284
Boys or girls?

1262
01:53:10,243 --> 01:53:11,786
Two boys.

1263
01:53:13,872 --> 01:53:15,623
Are you coming back home?

1264
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:18,960
No, I was just visiting.

1265
01:53:19,127 --> 01:53:21,880
I thought I'd see
if she was around, say hello.

1266
01:53:22,046 --> 01:53:24,257
How's your family doing?

1267
01:53:24,424 --> 01:53:26,301
Yeah, all right.

1268
01:53:26,468 --> 01:53:30,638
Well, she's not here.

1269
01:53:32,474 --> 01:53:34,309
You could write her. 
I have an address.

1270
01:53:34,476 --> 01:53:37,145
I'm not gonna write her a letter.

1271
01:53:37,312 --> 01:53:38,813
All right.

1272
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:47,572
Was she upset last time I was here?
When I left her here?

1273
01:53:49,073 --> 01:53:50,992
- Yes.
- Was she broken up about it?

1274
01:53:52,911 --> 01:53:54,496
Yes.

1275
01:53:54,662 --> 01:53:58,166
- She told you what happened?
- Yeah.

1276
01:53:58,333 --> 01:54:00,001
What'd she say?

1277
01:54:02,462 --> 01:54:06,174
That you said that you'd come back sometime.

1278
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:08,343
Is that right?

1279
01:54:10,136 --> 01:54:12,013
It was a long time ago.

1280
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:14,849
Where have you been?

1281
01:54:16,267 --> 01:54:20,188
I been working. Working, traveling.

1282
01:54:20,355 --> 01:54:23,858
I think I've been halfway around the world
since I last saw Doris.

1283
01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:27,695
How old is she now?

1284
01:54:27,862 --> 01:54:29,864
Doris is 23.

1285
01:54:31,783 --> 01:54:33,618
'Cause I wanted to know.

1286
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:38,289
You know, she was-

1287
01:54:39,499 --> 01:54:41,334
She was too young when I-

1288
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:46,214
Well, she's happy, and that's good.

1289
01:54:49,467 --> 01:54:50,969
I'll tell her you came to see me.

1290
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:53,304
That's not gonna matter.

1291
01:54:54,389 --> 01:54:56,057
Give me a break.

1292
01:55:03,147 --> 01:55:04,899
It was nice to see you.

1293
01:55:06,025 --> 01:55:07,694
Am I leaving?

1294
01:55:09,362 --> 01:55:12,407
No. Whatever you'd like.
You can come in.

1295
01:55:12,574 --> 01:55:16,911
- Nah. I gotta go.
- Okay.

1296
01:55:17,078 --> 01:55:19,247
Thank you.

1297
01:55:19,414 --> 01:55:23,376
- How's Mr. Solstad?
- Why, he's very good.

1298
01:55:23,543 --> 01:55:26,379
He's working, and-

1299
01:55:26,546 --> 01:55:29,048
- Will you tell him I said hello?
- All right.

1300
01:55:33,094 --> 01:55:36,931
So, her name is Doris Day?
Like the Doris Day?

1301
01:55:37,098 --> 01:55:39,517
- Yes.
- The movie star.

1302
01:55:39,684 --> 01:55:41,603
Yes.

1303
01:55:45,523 --> 01:55:46,941
<i>Who are you?</i>

1304
01:55:47,108 --> 01:55:49,068
<i>My name is Casper.</i>

1305
01:55:49,235 --> 01:55:52,572
<i>Hey, Casper.
Would you like to play pirate with me?</i>

1306
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:56,784
<i>Oh, boy! Would I!</i>

1307
01:55:56,951 --> 01:55:59,579
<i>How are we gonna tie this together, Casper?</i>

1308
01:55:59,746 --> 01:56:02,290
<i>I found some rope.</i>

1309
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,299
<i>Gee, Casper, you're a tricky one.</i>

1310
01:56:17,972 --> 01:56:19,891
Hello?

1311
01:56:20,058 --> 01:56:21,809
<i>I miss you.</i>

1312
01:56:23,478 --> 01:56:25,563
How'd you find me?

1313
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:28,650
<i>We're tied together.</i>

1314
01:56:28,816 --> 01:56:30,818
<i>Who got to you, Freddie?</i>

1315
01:56:30,985 --> 01:56:34,322
- What?
- <i>Who got to you?</i>

1316
01:56:34,489 --> 01:56:36,240
Nobody.

1317
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:41,329
<i>Come to England.
You'll love it here.</i>

1318
01:56:41,496 --> 01:56:44,415
<i>And I think it'll do you some good.
Can you do it?</i>

1319
01:56:44,582 --> 01:56:49,962
- Where?
- <i>We have a new school. It's in England.</i>

1320
01:56:50,129 --> 01:56:52,173
Well, my spaceship's in the shop.

1321
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,343
<i>You've still got it.</i>

1322
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:57,595
<i>Would you bring me some Kools?</i>

1323
01:56:57,762 --> 01:56:59,514
They don't have them there?

1324
01:56:59,681 --> 01:57:02,600
<i>The only bad part over here, no Kools.</i>

1325
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:07,814
How'd you find me?

1326
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:11,442
<i>Freddie, I have a matter of such urgency,</i>

1327
01:57:11,609 --> 01:57:14,112
<i>a matter that only you
can help me with.</i>

1328
01:57:14,278 --> 01:57:17,865
<i>That may, in fact,
cure the insane once and for all.</i>

1329
01:57:18,032 --> 01:57:20,118
<i>I can cure you.</i>

1330
01:57:20,284 --> 01:57:22,286
<i>And I remember where we've met.</i>

1331
01:57:22,453 --> 01:57:25,791
<i>Come to England. I'll tell you.</i>

1332
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:30,378
<i>Now, for the treasure!</i>

1333
01:57:30,545 --> 01:57:34,632
<i>"X" marks the spot
where the sunken treasure is.</i>

1334
01:57:37,552 --> 01:57:39,887
<i>Golly, Billy, there's the "X."</i>

1335
01:57:40,054 --> 01:57:42,473
<i>I'll get the treasure, Casper.</i>

1336
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:46,978
<i>The captain never leaves the ship.
I'll get it.</i>

1337
01:58:19,385 --> 01:58:21,596
Hello. Welcome.

1338
01:58:21,763 --> 01:58:24,265
Can we help you
and invite you to sit down?

1339
01:58:24,432 --> 01:58:26,601
You look like you've traveled here.

1340
01:58:26,768 --> 01:58:28,104
How else do you get someplace?

1341
01:58:30,271 --> 01:58:33,941
- Can I assist you in help?
- I'm here to see Master.

1342
01:58:34,108 --> 01:58:37,528
- And what's your name?
- Freddie Quell.

1343
01:58:37,695 --> 01:58:40,948
- Is he expecting you?
- He should be.

1344
01:58:45,912 --> 01:58:47,789
I took that picture.

1345
01:59:10,561 --> 01:59:12,146
Hello, Freddie.

1346
01:59:13,314 --> 01:59:14,899
Val.

1347
01:59:15,983 --> 01:59:17,777
You look good.

1348
01:59:19,821 --> 01:59:21,489
Come on.

1349
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:29,914
- Can I get this for you?
- No, thank you.

1350
01:59:35,503 --> 01:59:39,006
- How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

1351
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,712
Hello.

1352
02:00:18,379 --> 02:00:19,797
Hi.

1353
02:00:30,381 --> 02:00:31,809
Thank you.

1354
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,353
Thank you.

1355
02:01:10,765 --> 02:01:12,558
Some place.

1356
02:01:18,731 --> 02:01:20,399
Are you drunk?

1357
02:01:22,193 --> 02:01:24,111
No. No, no.

1358
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:31,118
You look sick.

1359
02:01:31,285 --> 02:01:33,287
Freddie, you don't look healthy.

1360
02:01:35,289 --> 02:01:38,376
I don't look like that.
That's not how I look.

1361
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:41,045
You don't think you can?

1362
02:01:41,212 --> 02:01:43,005
It's just not how I look.

1363
02:01:46,092 --> 02:01:49,136
You can't take this life straight,
can you?

1364
02:01:56,227 --> 02:01:57,728
What do you want?

1365
02:02:00,898 --> 02:02:02,483
I don't know.

1366
02:02:04,944 --> 02:02:07,989
I had a dream...

1367
02:02:14,662 --> 02:02:16,580
Where's Elizabeth?

1368
02:02:18,666 --> 02:02:23,754
- DCF.
- Really? What is that?

1369
02:02:25,339 --> 02:02:29,010
What did you expect
would happen coming here?

1370
02:02:34,181 --> 02:02:36,350
I can take pictures...

1371
02:02:37,685 --> 02:02:39,520
if you need them.

1372
02:02:41,439 --> 02:02:43,691
We don't need pictures, Freddie.

1373
02:02:46,527 --> 02:02:49,864
This is something you do for a billion years
or not at all.

1374
02:02:50,031 --> 02:02:52,366
This isn't fashion.

1375
02:03:01,459 --> 02:03:03,002
This is pointless.

1376
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:07,048
He isn't interested in getting better.

1377
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:23,189
She's really softened up.

1378
02:03:33,741 --> 02:03:36,368
Free winds and no tyranny for you?

1379
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,748
Freddie...

1380
02:03:43,584 --> 02:03:45,255
sailor of the seas.

1381
02:03:48,422 --> 02:03:50,091
You pay no rent.

1382
02:03:51,759 --> 02:03:53,928
Free to go where you please.

1383
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:01,393
Then go.

1384
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:08,901
Go to that landless latitude,
and good luck.

1385
02:04:12,279 --> 02:04:17,243
For if you figure a way to live
without serving a master...

1386
02:04:19,245 --> 02:04:20,788
any master...

1387
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:25,543
then let the rest us know, will you?

1388
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:31,382
For you'd be the first person
in the history of the world.

1389
02:04:36,804 --> 02:04:42,768
In my dream, you said you'd-
you figured out where we met.

1390
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:51,569
I went back and I found it.

1391
02:04:51,735 --> 02:04:54,321
I recalled you and I working together...

1392
02:04:55,823 --> 02:04:58,492
in Paris.

1393
02:04:58,659 --> 02:05:01,662
We were members of the Pigeon Post.

1394
02:05:01,829 --> 02:05:06,834
During a four and a half month siege
of the city by Prussian forces.

1395
02:05:08,502 --> 02:05:12,006
We worked and rigged balloons...

1396
02:05:12,173 --> 02:05:16,010
that delivered mail and secret messages...

1397
02:05:16,177 --> 02:05:19,763
across the communications blockade,

1398
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:22,641
set up by the Prussians.

1399
02:05:22,808 --> 02:05:27,646
We sent 65 unguided mail balloons
and only two went missing.

1400
02:05:30,274 --> 02:05:32,359
In the worst winter on record.

1401
02:05:41,869 --> 02:05:43,329
Two.

1402
02:05:52,213 --> 02:05:55,591
If you leave here,
I don't ever want to see you again.

1403
02:06:05,142 --> 02:06:06,894
Or you can stay.

1404
02:06:13,817 --> 02:06:16,028
Maybe in the next life?

1405
02:06:18,322 --> 02:06:20,908
If we meet again in the next life,

1406
02:06:21,075 --> 02:06:25,913
you will be my sworn enemy,
and I will show you no mercy.

1407
02:09:20,087 --> 02:09:22,923
Do you think you could just look into my eyes
and not blink,

1408
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:26,218
and I'm gonna ask you some questions
that'll help you?

1409
02:09:26,385 --> 02:09:28,095
Maybe.

1410
02:09:28,262 --> 02:09:32,057
All right. Starting now.
You can't blink.

1411
02:09:32,224 --> 02:09:33,392
You just look in my eyes.

1412
02:09:33,559 --> 02:09:34,969
You're already blinking.

1413
02:09:35,436 --> 02:09:37,604
Starting now, all right?
What's your name?

1414
02:09:37,771 --> 02:09:40,858
- I told you-
- No, just say your name.

1415
02:09:41,024 --> 02:09:42,776
You don't remember?

1416
02:09:42,943 --> 02:09:46,780
- Just say your name.
- You're drunk.

1417
02:09:46,947 --> 02:09:48,740
You have to say your name.
And you blinked,

1418
02:09:48,907 --> 02:09:51,785
infringement, back to the start.
Now, say your name.

1419
02:09:51,952 --> 02:09:53,537
Winn.

1420
02:09:53,704 --> 02:09:59,084
- Now say your full name.
- Winn Manchester.

1421
02:09:59,251 --> 02:10:03,255
- Say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

1422
02:10:03,422 --> 02:10:06,633
- Say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

1423
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,304
- Now, say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

1424
02:10:10,471 --> 02:10:12,973
Have you ever lived before?

1425
02:10:14,641 --> 02:10:16,477
I don't know.

1426
02:10:19,313 --> 02:10:21,732
Maybe this isn't your only life.

1427
02:10:24,818 --> 02:10:26,322
I hope it isn't.

1428
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:32,951
You're the bravest girl I've ever known.

1429
02:10:37,831 --> 02:10:40,083
Now stick it back in, it fell out.

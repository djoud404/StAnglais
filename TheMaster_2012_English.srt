1
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,872
You know how you
get rid of crabs?

2
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,107
- How?
- You got to shave one testicle.

3
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:55,618
All the crabs go over
to the other testicle,

4
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,348
you got to light the hair
on fire on that one.

5
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,358
When they all go scurrying out, you take
an ice pick and you fucking stab

6
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,368
- every single last one of them.

7
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,432
<i>The Allied
armed forces have been ordered to

8
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,163
<i>suspend offensive action.

9
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,706
<i>The proclamation of V-J Day

10
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,275
<i>must await upon
the formal signing

11
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,606
<i>of the surrender terms by Japan.

12
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,442
<i>The Japanese
delegation lines up on the opposite side

13
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,777
<i>of the surrender table
from the Alliance.

14
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,353
<i>A war which had entered its
eighth terrible year in China,

15
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,322
<i>which had raged for three years and
nine months for America and Britain,

16
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,054
<i>which was the brutal, costly,
eastern half of the most horrible

17
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,289
<i>worldwide war in human history,

18
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,731
<i>is now within minutes
of ending for good.

19
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,858
<i>General MacArthur speaks.

20
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,667
<i>Let us pray that peace

21
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,176
<i>be now restored to the world,

22
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,978
<i>and that God will
preserve it always.

23
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:11,647
<i>- These proceedings are closed.

24
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,054
<i>Swarms of
United States aircraft

25
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,685
<i>fly in formation overhead
as the ceremony ends.

26
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,856
<i>The final United Nations
victory has been won.

27
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,628
<i>The war is over, peace is here.

28
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,116
Move it in.

29
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,417
Move it in.

30
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,891
Next table, next table.

31
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,624
Move it in. Move it in.
Move it in.

32
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,429
You men are blessed

33
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,561
with the rejuvenating
powers of youth.

34
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,267
The responsibilities of peacetime
must now be considered.

35
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,106
You can start a business:

36
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,943
filling station,
grocery or hardware store.

37
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,711
Get a few acres of land
and raise some chickens...

38
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,250
...go back to school.

39
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,446
Undoubtedly, there will be
people on the outside

40
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,150
who will not understand
the condition you men have,

41
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,922
or will think it
a rather shameful condition.

42
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,612
If the average civilian
had been through

43
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,256
the same stresses that
you have been through,

44
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,131
undoubtedly they too would have
developed the same nervous conditions.

45
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,603
Freddie, I'm going to show you
a series of pictures.

46
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,073
I want you to tell me the first
thing that comes to your mind.

47
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,769
There's no right or wrong answers.

48
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,610
Tell me what you see.

49
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,276
Well, that's a pussy,
a lady's pussy.

50
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,451
What about this one?

51
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,649
Looks like cock
going inside of a pussy.

52
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,331
All right, let's try it again.

53
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,127
Tell me what you see, Freddie.

54
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,666
That looks like...

55
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,328
That's just like a cock,
actually, upside down.

56
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,635
Thank you.

57
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,133
<i>You've had episodes
of enuresis?

58
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,537
Yes, that's right.

59
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,804
My kidneys were all tore up
from it all over there,

60
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,005
and it came on strong.

61
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,918
And what's this about
a crying episode?

62
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,850
What crying episode?

63
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,322
It says here you had a severe headache,
and a crying spell.

64
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,428
I didn't have a crying spell.

65
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,327
It was brought on by a letter
I received from a girl I knew once.

66
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,559
I think I...

67
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,192
I believe I suffered what,
in your profession,

68
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,704
you call nostalgia.

69
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,538
It was nostalgia that was
brought on by a letter I received.

70
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,078
From your sweetheart?

71
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,148
No, sir, not my sweetheart.

72
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,416
The kid sister of a girl...

73
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,754
The kid sister of a friend of mine
I knew from back home.

74
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,191
I received this letter, and...

75
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,069
I received a letter and I read it.

76
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,241
According to the history here,
I notice that you say

77
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,576
- you saw a vision of your mother.
- Now, it wasn't a vision.

78
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,980
- It was a dream.
- Well, tell me about the dream.

79
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,517
Why?

80
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,520
- I need to know.
- Why do you need to know?

81
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,553
This will help in your treatment.

82
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,094
You can't help in my treatment,
you don't even know...

83
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,731
Well, it was my mother
and my father and me...

84
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,569
...back home.

85
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,303
We were sitting around a table...

86
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,146
...having drinks.

87
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,378
Laughing-

88
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,447
And it just sort of ended there.

89
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,421
Thanks for the help.

90
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,031
Now, you have such pretty eyes,

91
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,764
I want the light to catch it.

92
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,805
Look more this way.

93
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,604
Chin up a little. OK.

94
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,903
And just look at me.

95
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,976
And smile.

96
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,346
- Beautiful.

97
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,112
Ready?

98
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,279
Well, give a good smile.

99
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:21,495
Three, two, one.

100
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,725
Beautiful.

101
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:42,543
Only $49.99. Handmade.

102
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:56,029
Handmade imported mink.
Only $49.99.

103
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,855
Forty-nine, ninety-nine.

104
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,281
Only $49.99.

105
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,414
- You have a break coming?
- I hope so.

106
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,720
- When?
- Ten minutes.

107
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,361
- Ugh.

108
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,770
- Oh...
- Taste good?

109
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,679
I have an apricot belly,
want to see?

110
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,586
Yes.

111
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,367
I'm really a very good girl.

112
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,972
Where do you get
this idea about me?

113
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,973
Maybe we think the same
things at the same time.

114
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:23,672
Oh, my goodness.
I think we do.

115
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,346
What else do you
want to see, these?

116
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,954
Yes.

117
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,424
- Are they nice?
- Yes.

118
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,433
- Handmade.
- Yes, they are.

119
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,037
- That's enough now.
- Oh...

120
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,342
Want to go out tonight?

121
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,005
Yeah, sure.

122
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,229
- Are you married?
- Uh, yes.

123
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,226
- This for your wife?
- Pardon me?

124
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,463
- This for your wife?
- Uh, yes.

125
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,938
Don't move. Just stay still.

126
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:18,118
It's a little warm.

127
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,232
It's hot.

128
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,497
I'm starting to sweat.

129
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,009
You need to shut up.

130
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,135
You need to move the God...

131
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,078
You need to shut up.

132
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,350
You need to back off.

133
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,976
Sit down.
I'm very sorry.

134
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,679
I'm trying to get
the lighting right.

135
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,917
You must understand,
I want to get the lighting right.

136
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,394
Oh.

137
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,004
- That's enough.
- Little bit.

138
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,620
Drink that.

139
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,588
One gulp.

140
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,492
- What's your name?
- Frank.

141
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,364
Frank.

142
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,074
You look like my father.

143
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,583
Need some water.

144
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,325
We need to give him some water.

145
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,264
- I didn't put anything in his drink.
- Did you give him poison?

146
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,836
- No, everybody had the same thing.
- No, you're lying.

147
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,804
- I didn't lie, he's dehydrated.
- No, you poisoned him.

148
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,205
- No, I didn't poison him.
- No, you poisoned him.

149
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:23,508
- No. He took it, he took it himself.
- No. You poisoned him.

150
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,139
No, he needs some water.

151
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,185
- Move, move.
- No, no, you poisoned him.

152
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,845
- He needs some water.
- You poisoned him, you poisoned him.

153
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,015
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I didn't poison him.

154
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:37,321
I didn't do anything.
Please take your hands off me.

155
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,329
- I didn't poison him.
- You poisoned him.

156
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,564
I didn't do anything wrong, OK?

157
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,968
He took the drink himself,
he took it.

158
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,574
I didn't do anything.

159
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,480
Good morning.

160
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,248
Are you all right?

161
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,717
Who are you?
Where am I?

162
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,686
You're safe, you're at sea.

163
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:58,127
Here. Come with me.

164
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,196
Come on.

165
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,155
Here.

166
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,836
All right.

167
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,873
All right.

168
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,109
Is this your ship?

169
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,408
I am its commander, yes.

170
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,912
Where is it going?

171
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,617
New York City,
through the canal.

172
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,382
You're a seaman.

173
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,687
Yeah. How did I get down here?

174
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,934
You were acting aggressive
because you drank too much alcohol.

175
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,310
No, I don't think so.

176
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:28,583
You told me you were an able-bodied
seaman, and you were looking for work.

177
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,884
I told you?

178
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,957
Yeah, well, you have any?

179
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,662
Why all the skulking
and sneaking?

180
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,433
Work cannot be that
difficult to come by.

181
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:53,834
That depends on when
you're ready to go.

182
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,106
- You shouldn't work in your condition.
- No, I can work.

183
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,682
- You're aberrated.
- No, I'm not.

184
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,783
- Know what that means?
- No.

185
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,186
You've wandered from
the proper path, haven't you?

186
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,730
- These problems you have...

187
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,055
I don't have any problems.
I don't know what I told you,

188
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,298
but if you have work for me to do,
I can do it.

189
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,542
You seem so familiar to me.

190
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,543
Yeah.

191
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,681
What do you do?

192
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,687
I do many, many things.

193
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,920
I am a writer, a doctor,

194
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,031
a nuclear physicist,
a theoretical philosopher...

195
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,293
...but above all I am a man.

196
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,739
A hopelessly inquisitive man,
just like you.

197
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,844
Well, I'm sorry if I got
out of hand last night.

198
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:11,182
- It was cold and I was...
- Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel.

199
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,255
And as a scientist
and a connoisseur, I have...

200
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:20,592
...I have no idea the contents
of this remarkable potion.

201
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,925
What's in it?

202
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,930
Secrets.

203
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,935
Can you make more?

204
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,233
Well, not like that.

205
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,778
But I can make you
something different, better.

206
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,609
I'll make something
special for you.

207
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,273
How do you like to feel?

208
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,821
I will give you a full reprieve
from your naughtiness

209
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,653
as a stowaway,
if you make us some more.

210
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:52,729
I must admit I, I sampled it
and ended up drinking it all.

211
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,667
Would you scrub yourself
and make yourself clean.

212
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:03,273
My daughter is getting married.

213
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,636
Come and join us.

214
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,505
Leave your worries for a while.

215
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,874
They'll still be there
when you get back.

216
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,609
And your memories aren't invited.

217
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,756
Stand wherever you like.

218
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,330
Good day, good day,
good day, good day.

219
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,165
What a day. What a day.

220
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,670
Mama.

221
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,334
Rascal.

222
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,671
Clark, big day?

223
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,711
- Big day indeed, sir.
- How are you feeling?

224
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,076
I feel pretty well, thank you.
How are you?

225
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,013
Wonderful.

226
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,713
As long as you hold these bodies,

227
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:29,792
in this life,
you will be man and wife.

228
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,361
You may kiss the bride.

229
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,424
Marriage!

230
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:08,799
Previous to The Cause
was awful.

231
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,637
Awful.

232
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,641
It was a cycle, like life.

233
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:24,407
Birth, excitement,
growth, decay, death.

234
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,716
Now... now...

235
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,254
...how about this?

236
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,892
Here it comes... a large dragon.

237
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,157
Teeth...

238
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,861
...blood dripping, red eyes.
What do I got?

239
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,437
A lasso. I whip it up.

240
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,940
I wrap it around its neck,
and I wrestle,

241
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,069
wrestle, wrestle him
to the ground.

242
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,648
I snap up.
I say, "Sit, dragon." Dragon sits.

243
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,275
I say "Stay." Dragon stays.

244
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,978
- Now it's got a leash on it.

245
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,056
I take it for a walk.

246
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,660
And that's where
we're at with it now.

247
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,898
It stays on command.

248
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,660
Next we're going to teach it
to roll over and play dead.

249
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,810
- Love that story.
- So, where are you from?

250
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,316
- Huh?
- Where are you from?

251
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,976
Lynn, Massachusetts.

252
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,556
- Freddie Quell, how do you do?
- I'm Val. I'm his son.

253
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,455
Oh, yeah, I see it.

254
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,721
So what kind of work
will you be doing?

255
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,661
- Not sure.
- Done any Time Hole work?

256
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,563
- Any what?
- Any Time Hole work?

257
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,034
I don't think so.
I don't know what that is.

258
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,564
- I'm sure you're going to love it.
- I hope so.

259
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,267
- Nice to meet you and welcome aboard.
- Looking forward to it.

260
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,340
- How long have you known him?
- Good night!

261
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,471
- About three years.
- Good night, good night, good night.

262
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,414
Thank you, thank you
for being here.

263
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,247
- Norman...
- Three years?

264
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,649
Thank you.

265
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,415
- Good night, Master.
- Good night.

266
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,850
When can we have
some more of your potion?

267
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,359
Whenever you like,
I'll make it.

268
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,554
When I like it,
I'll give you a signal.

269
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,825
I'll rub my nose
and scratch my ear.

270
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,559
What will you need?

271
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,000
- I'll take care of it.
- Good.

272
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,401
- Anything you need.
- Thank you, good night.

273
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,504
Good night, everyone.

274
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,141
Don't get up.
Don't get up.

275
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,240
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

276
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,317
What a day.

277
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:47,689
We fought against the day
and we won. We won.

278
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:58,266
Freddie, feel free to sit with us.

279
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,561
Can you invite him over?

280
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,332
Say, come on over.

281
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,486
Can you say hi?

282
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,453
<i>He's... been writing all night.

283
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,719
You seem to inspire something in him.

284
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,226
- Yeah?
- Mm.

285
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,092
When we're at home, on land,

286
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,497
there's too much pulling him
in each direction.

287
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,570
Every time he sits to write,
a new attack is launched against him,

288
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,902
and he spends too much time
defending himself.

289
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,771
Who's attacking him?

290
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,611
People who are scared.

291
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,808
People who are greedy.

292
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,580
Ex-wives.

293
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,319
That's what's so nice
about being at sea.

294
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,154
- He gets his studies done.
- Hm.

295
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,991
Advances the learning.
He writes book two.

296
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,966
Say "back beyond" and return
to the pre-birth area.

297
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,006
Back beyond,
back beyond, back beyond.

298
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,171
Back beyond.

299
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,369
- How are you feeling?
- Back beyond.

300
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,448
Back beyond... I feel cold.

301
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:22,450
- Continue, please.
- Back beyond,

302
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,783
back beyond, back beyond.

303
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,822
Continue, please,
and tell me what you hear.

304
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,187
It's my mother.

305
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,759
Recall what she says.
Recall a sound.

306
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,892
It's her voice.

307
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,561
She's saying,

308
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,300
"We shouldn't be doing this,
not while she's inside me."

309
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,637
- Repeat what she says.
- "Not while I'm pregnant."

310
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,302
Repeat what she says.

311
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,108
Do you understand what's happening?

312
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:56,848
I'm not sure.

313
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,388
We record everything.

314
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,318
Really?

315
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,862
Through all lifetimes.

316
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:41,254
<i>Man is not an animal.

317
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:46,836
<i>We are not a pan'
of the animal kingdom.

318
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,531
<i>We sit far above that crowd.

319
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:56,203
<i>Perched as spirits, not beasts.

320
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:02,075
<i>You are not ruled by your emotions.

321
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,278
<i>It is not only possible,

322
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:09,882
<i>it is easily achievable
that we do away

323
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:14,828
<i>with all negative
emotional impulses,

324
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:20,369
<i>and bring man back to his
inherent state of perfect.

325
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,265
<i>Man is not an animal.

326
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:33,314
<i>We are not a pan'
of the animal kingdom.

327
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,880
<i>We sit far above that crowd.

328
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,850
<i>Perched as spirits, not beasts.

329
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:49,591
<i>You are not ruled
by your emotions.

330
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:55,069
<i>It is not only possible,
it is easily achievable...

331
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:53,919
Hm-mm.

332
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,970
Cheers.

333
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,538
Mm.

334
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,906
- Oh, God!

335
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:17,009
Oh, God! Oh, God!

336
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,883
Freddie.

337
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,748
Lovely.

338
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,996
I've been writing.

339
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,432
Feel like I went under.

340
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:36,437
Dark cloud rolls in, opens up.

341
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,735
Anxious to share new work.

342
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,038
Would you care
for some informal processing?

343
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,910
Sure. What do I have to do?

344
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,779
- Just answer my questions, we talk.
- OK.

345
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,114
Very good. Have a seat.

346
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,614
How are you feeling, Freddie?

347
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,319
Good.

348
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,898
- You rested?
- Yes.

349
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,762
- Excited?
- Yeah.

350
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,960
Have you made some friends?

351
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,402
- Everyone is very nice here.
- Good. Good.

352
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:13,407
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah, good.

353
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:17,438
I gather myself.

354
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,947
You'll be my guinea pig
and protégé.

355
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,651
Informal processing.

356
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,098
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

357
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,261
Say your name.

358
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,374
- Freddie Quell.
- Say it again.

359
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,874
Freddie Quell.

360
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,137
- Say it again.
- Freddie Quell.

361
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,269
- Say it again.
- Freddie Quell.

362
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,110
Might as well say it
one more time,

363
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,615
just to make sure
you know who you are.

364
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,719
Freddie Quell.

365
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,650
Are you thoughtless
in your remarks?

366
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,515
I usually put
some thought into them.

367
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,719
Do you linger at bus stations
for pleasure?

368
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,353
No.

369
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,762
Do you get muscle spasms
for no reason?

370
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:12,831
No.

371
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,239
Do your past failures
bother you?

372
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,636
No.

373
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,743
Do your past failures
bother you?

374
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,141
No.

375
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,441
Do your past failures
bother you?

376
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,350
No.

377
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,511
Do your past failures in life
bother you?

378
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:34,913
No.

379
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,890
- Is your life a struggle?
- No.

380
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:41,225
- Do you like to be told what to do?
- No.

381
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,162
Is your behavior erratic?

382
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,227
No.

383
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,499
Do you find interest
in other people?

384
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,437
Not really.

385
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:56,102
- Do you find it easy to be fair?

386
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,577
Yes.

387
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,114
Are you often consumed by envy?

388
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,115
No, about what?

389
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,483
Are you often consumed by envy?

390
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,359
I don't unders...
You mean like jealousy?

391
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:14,692
- Like jealousy.
- Oh, well, yeah.

392
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,062
I don't like someone else's hands
on my girls.

393
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,727
I don't like to think about it.
It makes me sick.

394
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,397
Are you scientific in your thought?

395
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,869
Yes.

396
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,502
Are you concerned with
the impression you make?

397
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,708
Mm...

398
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,712
I don't understand.

399
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,752
Yes, you do.

400
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:46,454
Well, most people are asses,
if that's what you mean.

401
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,224
Are you usually truthful to others?

402
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:52,233
No. I don't know.

403
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:55,736
- Sometimes.
- Are you unpredictable?

404
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,809
Silly.

405
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,578
Silly animal.

406
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,052
- I couldn't help it.
- Dirty animal.

407
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,254
Sorry.

408
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,590
It's good to laugh
during processing.

409
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:25,167
Sometimes we forget,
even if it is the sound of an animal.

410
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:35,042
Freddie Quell, test session,
March 5th, 1950, 1800 hours.

411
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,204
Aboard the sailing vessel Alethia.

412
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,976
LD, MOC, MD,
logged and approved.

413
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,781
Should we sample another sip
before we join them upstairs?

414
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,321
Wait, that's it?

415
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,190
For now.

416
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,159
No, no, no, no.
You got to ask me more.

417
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,094
This is fun.
Come on, you got to ask me more.

418
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,295
Could you answer the next series of
questions without blinking your eyes?

419
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,837
- Yes.
- Without fear and hesitation,

420
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,168
- answer as quickly as you can?
- Sure.

421
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,343
- Again.

422
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:23,518
Starting now,
you are not to blink.

423
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,424
If you blink we go back
to the start.

424
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,053
Infringement.

425
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,427
You blinked.

426
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,933
Starting now,
you are not to blink.

427
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,537
If you blink,
we go back to the start.

428
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,266
Do you often think about
how inconsequential you are?

429
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,704
No.

430
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,040
Do you believe that God will save you
from your own ridiculousness?

431
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,237
No.

432
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,809
Have you ever had intercourse
with someone inside your family?

433
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,942
Yes.

434
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,747
Have you ever had intercourse
with someone inside your family?

435
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,048
- Yes.
- Who?

436
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,884
- My auntie.
- Have you killed anyone?

437
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,356
- No.
- Maybe?

438
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,427
- Not me.
- Have you killed anyone?

439
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,052
- No.
- How many times did you

440
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,130
- have intercourse with your aunt?
- Three times.

441
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,891
- Where is your aunt now?
- I don't know.

442
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,296
Would you like to have
intercourse with her again?

443
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,458
No.

444
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:09,868
- Do you regret this?
- No.

445
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,600
- Where is your mother?
- I don't know. Loony...

446
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,232
- Infringement.
- Fuck!

447
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,776
- Back to the start.
- OK.

448
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,983
Do you often think about
how inconsequential you are?

449
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,556
Yes.

450
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,990
- Do you believe that God will save you?
- No.

451
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,822
Have you ever had sex
with a member of your family?

452
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,089
- Yes.
- Are you lying?

453
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,164
- No.
- Who?

454
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,426
- My Auntie Bertha.
- Where is your aunt now?

455
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,331
I don't know, maybe home.

456
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,404
- Are you lying?
- No.

457
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,063
- Are you a liar?
- Yes.

458
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:47,108
- Have you killed anyone?
- Yes.

459
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,074
- Who?
- Japs in war.

460
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,476
- Do you regret this?
- No.

461
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:55,574
- What are you running from?
- Maybe I hurt a man, I think.

462
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:57,414
Maybe he's dead.
I don't know.

463
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,850
- Where?
- In Salinas.

464
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,116
He stole a batch of my booze
and he drank it.

465
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,691
- Is this booze you make poison?
- Not if you drink it smart.

466
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,988
- Are you trying to poison me?
- No.

467
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,028
- Where is your father?
- Dead.

468
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,132
- How did he die?
- Drunk.

469
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,631
Where is your mother?

470
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,205
Where is your mother?

471
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,202
- Loony bin.
- Is she psychotic?

472
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,605
Yes.

473
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,373
- What is the name of your aunt?
- Bertha.

474
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:26,582
How did you come to have sex
with your Auntie Bertha?

475
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,015
- I was drunk and she looked good.
- And you did it again and again?

476
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,949
Yes.

477
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,035
Have you ever had bad thoughts
about Master Peggy?

478
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,885
- Yes.
- What did you think?

479
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:37,357
- I thought you were fools.
- Am I a fool to you?

480
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,083
- No, sir.
- If you were locked in a room

481
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,856
for the rest of your life,
who would be in there with you?

482
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,864
- Doris.
- Who's Doris?

483
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,798
Best girl I ever met.
The girl I'm going to marry one day.

484
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,403
- Is she in Lynn?
- Yes.

485
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:50,028
- Lynn, Massachusetts?
- Yes, sir.

486
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:52,732
- Then why aren't you with her?
- I'm an idiot.

487
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:56,311
- Why aren't you with that lovely girl?
- I got no reason. I'm a fool.

488
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:57,708
- Do you love Doris?
- Yes.

489
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,371
- Is she the love of your life?
- Yes, sir.

490
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,381
- Then why aren't you with her?
- I don't know.

491
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,884
Yes, you do. Tell me why you're
not with her if you love her so much.

492
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,988
I told her I'd come back,
and I never went back

493
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,748
and now I just,
I got to get back to her.

494
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,440
- Why don't you go back?
- I don't know.

495
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:10,857
- Why don't you go back?
- I don't know!

496
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,393
Close your eyes.

497
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,971
<i>Recall a word.

498
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,181
<i>Flowers.

499
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:42,253
<i>Can you recall
what you're wearing?

500
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:48,991
<i>Navy blues.

501
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,499
<i>What do you hear?

502
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,376
<i>Voices inside.

503
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:05,512
Hello, Mrs. Solstad.

504
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,852
What made you come and see me?

505
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,957
I thought about you.

506
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,858
I thought about you
when I was away.

507
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:28,062
I got your letter.

508
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,268
They have you write
to soldiers at school?

509
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,470
I wrote to you.

510
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,982
How come you didn't write me back?

511
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,711
I don't know.

512
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,548
I did.
I just... never sent it.

513
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,858
Are you going to Briar Cliff?

514
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,794
I'm not in college.

515
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:00,864
What are you, a senior?

516
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,869
- Junior?
- No.

517
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,975
- You're not a freshman.
- I'm a sophomore.

518
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,874
- So how old does that make you?
- Sixteen.

519
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,447
- Did you think I was older?
- No.

520
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,649
I don't really remember.

521
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:25,322
- Can I kiss you?

522
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,201
<i>Recall a sound.

523
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:46,106
She's singing.

524
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,597
Her voice settles me down.

525
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:02,018
I'm meant to go to Norway.

526
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,593
- When's this?
- November.

527
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:12,558
What for?

528
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,068
I'm going to meet
the rest of our family.

529
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,573
Well, I don't think you should go.

530
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,253
No, you're not going to go.

531
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,754
I came all this way to see you,
and I want you to stay here.

532
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,960
All right.

533
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,224
All right.

534
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,498
Can you recall a word?

535
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:55,970
Any word.

536
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,238
Away.

537
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:02,612
- Say it again.
- Away.

538
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:10,523
- Who's saying "away"?
- I am.

539
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,289
<i>Outbound for Shanghai!

540
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:22,132
Need one able-bodied seaman,
one oiler and one baker.

541
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,795
The man McCoughsky.

542
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:26,698
The man Quell.

543
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:27,901
- Yeah.
- Oiler?

544
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:29,238
- Yes, sir.
- Done this before?

545
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,506
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow morning, 8:00.

546
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,818
- Hey.
- Hi.

547
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:41,981
Listen, I gotta go
somewhere for a few months,

548
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,854
so you should go to Norway.

549
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,587
- Where are you going?
- I got a job that takes me away.

550
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,355
- Where?
- I don't know.

551
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,433
Don't ask me so many questions.
I don't know anyway.

552
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:56,004
You know, I didn't know which window
was yours, and I always guess right.

553
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,869
You take your trip
and come back home,

554
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,998
and that's gonna be our time, right?

555
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,271
That's gonna be our time.
That's gonna be our time, right?

556
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:04,539
- Yeah.
- Right? Say yes.

557
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,341
- Say yes.
- Yes.

558
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:16,983
I'll be back in a minute.

559
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,618
<i>Release and return to me.

560
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,020
Open your eyes.

561
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:01,128
Say your name.

562
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:04,137
- Freddie Quell.
- Are you here with me in 1950?

563
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,740
Yes.

564
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,435
End of session.

565
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:19,278
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

566
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,789
- Left side of your body feel OK?
- Yes.

567
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,190
- Right side of your stomach?
- Yes.

568
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:29,196
- Headaches?
- A little.

569
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:32,667
Are you a member of
the Hidden Rulers?

570
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,532
- I don't know what that is.
- Any communist organization?

571
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,637
No.

572
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,366
Any invader force on this
planet or anywhere else?

573
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:41,499
No, sir.

574
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:44,169
You are the bravest boy
I've ever met.

575
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,996
To the poison.

576
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,630
Ah.

577
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:23,115
Well done.

578
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,891
Kools.

579
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,060
I like Kools.

580
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,497
Minty flavor.

581
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,700
Bill!

582
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,072
- Master, hello!
- Hello!

583
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:51,908
Welcome.

584
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:54,073
- Welcome back to New York City.
- Thank you.

585
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:57,414
- We are so happy you're here.
- I'm happy I'm here.

586
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,351
Peggy, watch your step.

587
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,718
Watch your step, everyone.

588
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,689
- Hello, Mildred.
- Hello.

589
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,385
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

590
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,587
- Mildred.
- Oh, hello.

591
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,254
This is Mildred Drummond.

592
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,627
- Very nice to meet you.
- Wonderful to meet you finally.

593
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,963
- My pleasure.
- And...

594
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,797
The boat was perfect.

595
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,201
- Thank you. Peggy, my wife.
- Hello, Peggy.

596
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:19,308
Nice to meet you.
And congratulations.

597
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,205
- Thank you.
- Freddie Quell.

598
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:24,142
- Freddie... Quell.

599
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:26,942
- Elizabeth, my daughter.
- Yes.

600
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:29,073
- Hello. How are you?
- Clark, my son-in-law.

601
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,243
- Hello, Clark.
- Lovely to meet you.

602
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,649
- Lovely to meet you.
- Norman Conrad.

603
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,016
- Yes.
- How do you do?

604
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:35,751
- Cliff Boyd.
- Good evening.

605
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,984
- Val, my son.
- Oh, yes.

606
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:40,152
How are you?
I can see the resemblance.

607
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:43,891
- Yes, yes. So can I.
- Why don't you come with me?

608
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:46,763
I will introduce you to...

609
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,631
- Oh, well, here's Poppy.
- Poppy!

610
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,069
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Yes.

611
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:52,765
- And the lovely Brigitte.
- Brigitte!

612
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,627
- Here you are.
- Good evening. Scotch.

613
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,664
- Scotch, OK. Neat or on the rocks?
- Neat.

614
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:18,994
Neat. Two fingers?

615
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,625
Yeah, it's fine.

616
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,165
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

617
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:25,274
- Thank you, Clark. Thank you.
- Thank you.

618
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:29,936
- Would you like something?
- We have some delicious treats inside.

619
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,138
- In the back? Those sandwiches?
- In the back. Yes.

620
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:36,012
- And an Old Fashioned.
- Old Fashioned for me.

621
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,121
Do you want to stay together
or do you want to come with me?

622
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,688
I'll join you.

623
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:42,552
All right, come with me, Peggy.

624
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,040
- Thank you so much.
- This is my friend I want you to meet,

625
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:46,309
- Michelle.
- Hi. How are you?

626
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,557
Open your eyes, come back to me.

627
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,158
What is your name?

628
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:26,163
Margaret O'Brien.

629
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,233
What is your name?

630
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,035
Well...

631
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,478
Now that you mention it...

632
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:47,886
...I think I was a man.

633
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,820
Laughing is good.

634
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:54,627
- My neck feels much better.
- Oh, that's good.

635
00:55:55,753 --> 00:56:00,793
What I just experienced,
was that me?

636
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,801
What was you, darling?

637
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:07,773
That man in the armor,
was that me?

638
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:09,809
Yes. That was your spirit.

639
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:13,210
Our spirits live on
in the whole of time,

640
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:17,649
exist in many vessels
through time.

641
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:22,281
This is the vessel
you're existing in now, in 1950.

642
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:25,485
- Excuse me.
- As you all may recall,

643
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:30,895
during the trauma that you went through
while we were processing...

644
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,125
Yes.

645
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:36,762
...It was of the utmost importance

646
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:40,034
that you experience every detail...

647
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:43,836
...every specific detail

648
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,743
through all of your senses,
of that memory,

649
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,440
and that we go over it again

650
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,677
and over it again
and over it again

651
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:53,414
until it loses its power.
This is very...

652
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:58,254
- Excuse me.
- This is very important.

653
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:00,919
- Why it is important...
- Excuse me.

654
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:05,830
...Is if you bring someone
out of a traumatic event,

655
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:08,129
back to the present time,

656
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,262
- no matter how carefully you do that...
- Excuse me.

657
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:12,772
...If you have not
gone over the memory...

658
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,069
Excuse me. Excuse me.

659
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,974
Some of this sounds
quite like hypnosis, is it not?

660
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:24,051
This is a process of
de-hypnotization, if you will.

661
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,781
Man is asleep. This process
wakes him from his slumber.

662
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:31,690
I still find it difficult
to see the proof

663
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,854
with regards to past lives
that your movement claims.

664
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:38,796
Would you care to
submit yourself to processing?

665
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,459
"Look through the telescope,"
as my friend said.

666
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,697
Oh, perhaps another time.

667
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,831
You've also said that these methods,
Cause Methods,

668
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,968
can cure leukemia,
according to your book, and...

669
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,172
Some forms of leukemia.

670
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,340
In being able
to access past lives,

671
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,351
we are able to treat illnesses
that may have started back

672
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,182
thousands, even trillions of years.

673
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,881
- Trillions?
- With a sir.

674
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:06,859
The earth is not understood
to be more than a few billion years old.

675
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:11,364
Even the smartest of our current
scientists can be fooled, yes.

676
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,329
- You can understand skepticism...
- Yes!

677
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:16,429
- ...can you not?
- Yes, yes.

678
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,508
For without it, we'd be positives
and no negatives, therefore zero charge.

679
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,578
- We must have it.
- Good science by definition

680
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,501
allows for more than one opinion,
does it not?

681
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:27,675
Which is why our gathering
of data is so far-reaching.

682
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,645
Otherwise, you merely have
the will of one man,

683
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,347
which is the basis of cult, is it not?

684
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:35,218
'Tis, 'tis.

685
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,189
And thankfully, we are, all of us,
working at breakneck speeds

686
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,886
and in unison towards capturing
the mind's fatal flaws

687
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:44,898
and correcting it back to
its inherent state of perfect.

688
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:49,098
Whilst righting civilization
and eliminating war and poverty,

689
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,968
and therefore, the atomic threat.

690
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:55,907
Well...

691
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,411
I find it quite difficult
to comprehend,

692
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,574
or more to the point, believe,
that you believe, sir,

693
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,084
that time travel hypnosis therapy

694
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,586
can bring world peace
and cure cancer.

695
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,520
I have never been
to the pyramids, have you?

696
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:13,220
- No.
- And yet we know that they are there

697
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,455
because learned men have told us so.

698
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,395
May I ask, what is your name?

699
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:22,328
- John More.
- Mr. More, if I may,

700
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:26,271
is there something frightening to you
about The Cause's travels into the past?

701
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,398
- Frightening? No, no.
- Yes.

702
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:31,979
What scares you so much about
traveling into the past, sir?

703
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,911
- I'm not frightened.
- Are you afraid that we might discover

704
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,745
that our past has been reshapen?

705
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:40,288
Perverted?

706
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,754
And perhaps what we think
we know of this world

707
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:46,088
- is false information?
- Time travel does not

708
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,162
frighten me, sir,
because it's not possible.

709
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:51,125
What does frighten me is the possibility
of some poor soul with leukemia

710
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,634
- coming to you...
- There are dangers

711
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,703
of traveling in and out of time
as we understand it.

712
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57,866
But it's not unlike traveling
down a river, you see?

713
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,340
You travel down the river,
'round the bend, look back,

714
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:02,341
and you cannot see
around the bend can you?

715
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:04,673
But that does not mean
it is not there, does it?

716
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:08,647
But certain clubs would like us
to think that a truth,

717
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:12,185
I say truth, uncovered
should stay hidden.

718
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:16,655
I belong to no club, and if you're
unwilling to allow any discussion...

719
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,193
No, this isn't a
discussion, it's a grilling.

720
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:23,298
There's nothing I can do for you
if your mind has been made up.

721
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,526
You seem to know the answers
to your questions. Why do you ask?

722
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:29,160
I'm sorry you're unwilling
to defend your beliefs

723
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,273
- in any kind of rational...
- If you already

724
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:35,707
know the answers to your questions,
then why ask, pig fuck?!

725
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,317
We are not helpless.

726
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:49,918
And we are on a journey
that risks the dark.

727
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,361
If you don't mind,
a good night to you.

728
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,797
Freddie, stop!

729
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,464
This is not the time. Stop.

730
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:15,681
- And this is where we are at.

731
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:20,687
At the lowest level to have
to explain ourselves, for what?

732
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,223
For what we do
we have to grovel?

733
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:27,457
The only way to defend ourselves
is to attack.

734
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:31,293
If we don't do that, we will lose
every battle that we are engaged in.

735
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,924
We will never dominate
our environment

736
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:37,004
the way we should
unless we attack.

737
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,138
And this city,
city is just noise.

738
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,143
I know this city.

739
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:49,410
I know its rotten secrets,
its filthy lies and secrets.

740
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:55,447
They... invited us here
and welcomed us.

741
01:01:57,347 --> 01:02:00,692
Only to throw us down
and kick us out.

742
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,027
It's a grim joke.

743
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,121
You got the names and information
of the people at this party, right?

744
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:32,420
- You invited them?
- Yeah, what for?

745
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,460
All right, Clark.
Get up, you're coming with me.

746
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:45,240
Hey, I need some help. You want to put
on a good show or no? Let's go. Come on.

747
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,508
Yes, who is it?

748
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:00,281
Mr. More, this is
Freddie Quell from The Cause.

749
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,981
I'd like to have a word.

750
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:06,356
Mr. Quell,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

751
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:09,327
Yes, sir, we have a gift
we'd like to present to you.

752
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:13,525
You'd like to present to me?
How do you... know where I live?

753
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:18,034
Um, can we come in,
just have a word?

754
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,300
How about if we do it right in
the doorway. How does that sound?

755
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,671
Sure, um...

756
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,146
Shit!

757
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,975
Jesus! Hey!

758
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:34,452
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

759
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,900
Well, I don't think you have
to worry about Mr. John More

760
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,059
speaking out against you.

761
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,198
What did you do?

762
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:57,701
He had a wise ass mouth.

763
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,781
My little soldier, what did you do?

764
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:04,147
- You need to tell me so that I know.
- No, I'm not going to tell you.

765
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,280
Nothing bad.

766
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,586
I just...
I just talked to him.

767
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:13,695
But this is not the way.

768
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,560
Naughty boy, OK?

769
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,428
All right? Freddie?

770
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,766
You are a mischief.

771
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,433
A horrible young man, you are.

772
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:30,135
This is acting like an animal,

773
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:33,271
a dirty animal that eats
its own feces when hungry.

774
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:36,875
We stand far above that crowd.

775
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,251
Don't we?

776
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,897
- Well...
- We need to remember where we've met.

777
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,897
It's nagging at me.

778
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,032
Isn't it you?

779
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:02,643
Thank you. Thank you.

780
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:08,478
Thank you.
Down, but not out.

781
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:13,083
No, not dead yet.

782
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,654
- Hello!
- Hello!

783
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,425
Welcome to Philadelphia!

784
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:26,967
- Everyone all right?
- I'm gonna race you!

785
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:30,500
You win!

786
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,870
You won, you won.

787
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:37,205
- Peggy, Elizabeth.
- Hello.

788
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:38,312
Clark.

789
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,475
<i>When we travel back
in the Time Hole,

790
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,485
there's a different feel
to another period in time

791
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:51,217
that is so basic
it's hard to describe.

792
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:55,319
So if you find yourself in a room...

793
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:04,367
...allow that there may be color
with unfamiliar tones,

794
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,474
perhaps because
the gaslight shining on it.

795
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:14,373
There may be a strange quality
to the air.

796
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:18,475
Its particles of dust derive
from un-modern constituents.

797
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:25,390
Even human bodies seem to radiate
a different kind of warmth

798
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:29,930
when covered with the fabrics
of another age.

799
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:33,830
Now, memory filters
all of that out.

800
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:39,933
But... when we return this way,

801
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:44,273
the Cause Way,
the way Master has discovered,

802
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:47,075
everything is intact.

803
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,478
With such gratitude.

804
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,228
Thank you.

805
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,027
What a welcome to Philadelphia.

806
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,541
- I'm in love.

807
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,480
I'm in love.
We've all been in love.

808
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:25,575
And when we're in love,
we experience pleasure...

809
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,784
...and extreme pain.

810
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:32,920
And that's what
I'd like to talk about.

811
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,235
<i>"Go Roving."

812
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,434
"Go Roving" in "G."

813
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,978
- Aw...

814
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,849
Sotto voce.

815
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,418
- Everyone!

816
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:06,278
Yes.

817
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,555
You can do whatever you want...

818
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,659
...as long as I don't find out.

819
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:32,332
And as long as no one
that I know knows about it.

820
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:36,035
- Other than that,

821
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,578
stop with this idea.

822
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,979
Put it back in its pants.

823
01:10:43,106 --> 01:10:47,486
It didn't work for them,
and it's not going to work for you.

824
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,682
We have enough problems
as it is, OK?

825
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,986
- Can you come for me?
- Oh, yes.

826
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:54,288
- Come for me.
- Oh, yes.

827
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,691
...best behavior out.

828
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,320
- Come for me?
- Yes.

829
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,626
- And no more of that boy's hooch.
- No more hooch.

830
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:00,996
- Say it again.
- No more hooch.

831
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:04,594
- Come for me.

832
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:10,343
Yes. Oh!

833
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,356
Freddie, wake up.

834
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,592
Come on. Wake up.

835
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,994
Come on.
Get yourself up.

836
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,003
- Wake up. Come on.
- Wait.

837
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,165
God. Yeah, come on.

838
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,675
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

839
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,507
Wake up.
Nothing's the matter.

840
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,639
I'm here to help you
with something.

841
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,944
- Wake up. Are you awake?
- I'm up!

842
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:53,549
- You awake?
- Yes.

843
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,952
- Look at me.

844
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:02,054
Freddie, I want you to place something
in the future for yourself.

845
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:07,095
I want you to place something
in the future for yourself

846
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:09,362
that you would like to have.

847
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:12,900
And tell me when it's done.

848
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:17,002
OK.

849
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:19,943
Now, it's there waiting for you,

850
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:24,279
and you can go and get it
whenever you're ready.

851
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:27,718
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

852
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:33,387
You can't stay with us any more
unless you quit boozing.

853
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,621
All right.

854
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:39,928
- Now tell me.
- What?

855
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:45,904
- Tell me that you will quit boozing.
- I'll quit boozing.

856
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,372
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

857
01:12:48,498 --> 01:12:52,469
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

858
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:55,742
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

859
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,457
You know you should wake up, Val.

860
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,545
Your father's speaking,
you might learn something.

861
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:50,463
He's making all this up
as he goes along.

862
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,267
You don't see that?

863
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:56,673
I can sleep and wake up
and not have missed one thing.

864
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:04,151
- You got something to say to me?
- No, sir.

865
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,049
Well, you should have.

866
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:11,147
You should say something.
Do something.

867
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,159
Say "fuck you." Be a man!

868
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,498
OK, you're all right,

869
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,076
you're fine, you're fine, OK?

870
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,270
Sit down and shut up.

871
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,081
Good afternoon.

872
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,814
Come home. You're late.

873
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:45,189
It's a beautiful house.
Are you the owner?

874
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,227
- No, sir.
- Is that how your mother said it?

875
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:50,388
We're looking for
Lancaster Dodd.

876
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,399
- I don't know who that is.
- He's in the house.

877
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:55,724
- Well, may I come in?
- He's just inside. Yes, come in.

878
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:58,101
- Now hold on.
- Are you the owner?

879
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,604
No, sir.

880
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:01,902
Well, I have a civil warrant here

881
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:04,238
- for a Lancaster Dodd.
- You're late.

882
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:06,278
Release and return
to present time.

883
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:07,904
- Excuse me, Kim.
- The owner's in the house.

884
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:09,141
May I come in?

885
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:10,842
No, you can't.
We're gonna have to talk to...

886
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:12,179
- He's just inside.
- I have a warrant here

887
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:14,083
to serve Lancaster Dodd.
A civil warrant.

888
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,917
What's happening here?

889
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:18,082
Good afternoon.
Are you Lancaster Dodd?

890
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:19,921
Good afternoon. Yes, I am.

891
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,052
I have a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

892
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,596
Goody. What are the charges?

893
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,532
By the district court
of Pennsylvania,

894
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:31,639
The Mildred Drummond Foundation

895
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:33,399
for wrongful withdrawal of funds.

896
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,304
This is a silly joke, no?

897
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:37,206
- No, it isn't, sir.
- This is...

898
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,333
I have to take you in
and book and fingerprint you.

899
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:40,575
...comic opera.

900
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,910
Is it illegal in this city
to get better?

901
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,111
No, but it's illegal to operate
a medical school without a license.

902
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:48,119
This is not a medical school,
it's a house.

903
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,246
Sir, this is my home
and these are my guests.

904
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,450
Ma'am, this is the City of
Philadelphia Police Department.

905
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:55,426
We have no disagreement with these boys
doing their work and all its silliness

906
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,155
as defenders of what code?

907
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,163
Well, we're with the City of
Philadelphia Police Department.

908
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:02,428
- What honor?! What honor do you have?!
- State of Pennsylvania, sir.

909
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,078
- Put your hands behind your back.
- What part of the galaxy...?

910
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:08,642
This is a scientific gathering.

911
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,805
Freddie! No, no, no, no, no.

912
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,846
- Calm down!
- No! Freddie!

913
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:17,247
Freddie! Calm down! No!

914
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,250
Calm down!
Do not hurt him!

915
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,553
Freddie!

916
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:25,318
It'll be OK!
Please, don't hurt him!

917
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:28,258
- I am with you, Daddy.
- You'll be out in no time.

918
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:30,762
We'll be...
we'll be out shortly!

919
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:34,459
- Just laugh!

920
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:40,202
- Just laugh.
- Everyone's laughing.

921
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,309
- Not you.
- I'll bring him to the station.

922
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,875
We're following right behind.
We'll be right there.

923
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:48,209
- OK. I'm fine. I'm fine. OK.
- We're following right behind you.

924
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:49,543
I'm with you, Daddy.

925
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:51,341
I'm fine. I love you!

926
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:52,976
Love you, too!

927
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,407
Your fear of capture
and imprisonment

928
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,917
is an implant from
millions of years ago.

929
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:08,188
This battle has been with you
from before you know.

930
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:11,757
This is not you.

931
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,696
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's not you.

932
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:16,804
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's not you.

933
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:20,499
- You are asleep.

934
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:26,375
Your spirit was free...

935
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:30,143
...moving from body
to the next body, free...

936
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:32,149
Free for a moment.

937
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,447
Then it was captured
by an invader force

938
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:36,420
bent on turning you
to the darkest way.

939
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,718
You've been implanted
with a push-pull mechanism

940
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:43,319
that keeps you fearful of
authority and destructive.

941
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,331
We are in the middle of a battle
that's a trillion years in the making,

942
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:49,402
- and it's bigger than the both of us.
- You're making this shit up!

943
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:51,698
You make this shit up!

944
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,829
You don't know what
you're talking about.

945
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:56,102
I don't know what
I'm talking about?

946
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,734
No, you don't.

947
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,142
I give you facts.

948
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,477
- You don't give me facts!
- They are not opinions.

949
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:05,950
- What facts? What facts?
- They are fucking facts!

950
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,611
- What facts? What facts?
- Fuck you!

951
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,689
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

952
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:11,587
- Why don't you kick the bed some more?
- Fuck you!

953
01:19:11,714 --> 01:19:13,625
- Fuck you, you lazy ass piece of shit!
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

954
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,126
- I'm not lazy!
- I'm done!

955
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,697
- You're fucking lazy!
- Oh, you make shit up...

956
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,300
- You're fuckin' lazy!
- Your fucking family hates you!

957
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,265
- Your son hates you!
- Oh, they do?

958
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:24,837
- Yeah! Your son hates you.
- Who fucking likes you except for me?

959
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,633
- Nobody!
- Except for me.

960
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,606
- No, you don't fucking like me.
- Who likes you except for me?

961
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:30,733
Shut up!

962
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,812
- Except for me?
- You, shut up!

963
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,710
- I'm the only one who likes you.
- Fuck you!

964
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:36,339
- Fuck you, too!
- Fuck you!

965
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,042
Fuck you!

966
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:40,848
- Just me, Freddie.
- Just you?

967
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:43,081
I'm the only one that likes you.

968
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,087
The only one.

969
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:53,629
You're a fucking drunk.

970
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:56,498
And I'm done with you.
Fucking...

971
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:18,016
- Mr. Dodd?
- Yes?

972
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,855
You're hereby ordered
to pay back $11,000

973
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,987
to the Mildred Drummond Foundation
no later than June first,

974
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:26,258
otherwise to incur
penalties of interest.

975
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:29,699
There's also the matter of
$1,500 in fuel and damages

976
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:34,171
to Mrs. Drummond's sailing yacht,
that shall be repaid on the same date.

977
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:59,927
- Dad?
- Yes?

978
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:06,902
I don't think Freddie's as committed
to The Cause as The Cause is to him.

979
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,608
When I told Freddie about
your unpublished work...

980
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:18,643
...his question to me was...

981
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:21,687
... "What is something like that worth?"

982
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,523
I think Freddie Quell's a spy.

983
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:31,762
Perhaps working
for some outside agency,

984
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:36,199
or the man's working for himself.

985
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:40,535
To steal and sell your book
to any dissenters who may want it.

986
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:47,477
"How do we know who he is?"
is perhaps the question.

987
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:52,616
And "What is the reason
he is here if he is past help?"

988
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,754
He makes me nervous.

989
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,293
I think he wants me.

990
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,595
I think he's in love with me.

991
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:17,800
I wonder how he got here,
and what he's after.

992
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,608
Is it really all so easy
that he just came across us?

993
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:24,377
He's a drunk,
and he's dangerous.

994
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,612
And he will be our undoing
if we continue to have him here.

995
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:37,091
Thank you...

996
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,031
...all of you...

997
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:42,635
...for your honesty.

998
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:47,935
But...

999
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:53,402
...if we are not helping him,

1000
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:57,483
then it is we
who have failed him.

1001
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:02,345
'Tis it not?

1002
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:06,984
Perhaps he's past help.

1003
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:10,689
Or insane.

1004
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,397
Thank you, truly.

1005
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:17,936
Thank you.

1006
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:20,734
Food for thought.

1007
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,540
There you go.

1008
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:35,715
Oh! Almost.

1009
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:32,108
Freddie, stand in the middle
of the room, please.

1010
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:44,751
Pick a spot over there,
touch it, and describe it to me.

1011
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,293
Um... It's wood, wall.

1012
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:56,233
Fine, fine.
Walk to this window over here.

1013
01:24:56,358 --> 01:24:59,237
Touch a spot on the window
and describe it to me.

1014
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:04,104
It just feels like glass.

1015
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:06,110
Well, that's because it is glass.

1016
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:09,114
Describe it.
Describe it the best you can.

1017
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:12,947
- Well, it's smooth.
- Right.

1018
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:16,454
It's warm, warmer than the wood,
because the sun's coming through.

1019
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:17,921
Very good.

1020
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:23,657
Very good. Now, walk to
that wall again, touch a spot.

1021
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,526
Close your eyes.

1022
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,895
Close your eyes.

1023
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:31,061
<i>This exercise will help
you with your concentration.

1024
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:33,605
What color are my eyes?

1025
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:37,408
Green.

1026
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,702
Turn them blue.

1027
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:46,718
A Ferris wheel?

1028
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:48,480
That's beautiful. Back again.

1029
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:51,357
Faster, please.

1030
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,481
Ooh.

1031
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,153
Could we move that back?

1032
01:25:55,284 --> 01:25:57,525
- It's a fucking wall!
- Could we move that back, please?

1033
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:00,457
I feel it! It's wood!

1034
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:03,564
Turn them black.

1035
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,898
What color are my eyes?

1036
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:11,806
Black.

1037
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:15,939
Very good.

1038
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:21,851
What we will do now
will urge you toward existence

1039
01:26:21,977 --> 01:26:26,016
within a group,
society or family.

1040
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:29,789
This is called Application 45,
Version 1.

1041
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:36,263
No matter what is said between
the subjects, we do not react.

1042
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:39,395
- OK.
- No matter what is said.

1043
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,106
And you must look at the subject.

1044
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:46,543
You must look at the subject.

1045
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:49,009
All right?

1046
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:51,446
One minute.

1047
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:56,013
Clark, you may begin.

1048
01:26:58,447 --> 01:26:59,858
Doris.

1049
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:04,731
- Fail.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1050
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:06,127
Fail.

1051
01:27:06,255 --> 01:27:09,259
It's the same fucking wall.

1052
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:12,429
Nothing. Nothing.
That's what I feel, nothing.

1053
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:16,441
All right.
Lunch on the veranda today.

1054
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:18,670
So, if you could all move,
except for you, Freddie.

1055
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,541
Back again, please?

1056
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:23,917
Everyone.

1057
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:25,712
Beautiful day.

1058
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,413
Well, luckily, I don't care.

1059
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:34,254
- Doris, Doris, Doris, Doris, Doris.
- Doris.

1060
01:27:34,383 --> 01:27:37,762
See, it doesn't even affect me.

1061
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:39,866
Doris. Say it.

1062
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:41,433
- Doris.
- Doris.

1063
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:43,365
- Doris.
- Doris, see?

1064
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:44,493
- You miss her?
- Huh?

1065
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:45,604
Do you miss Doris?

1066
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:48,674
Say her fucking name again,
I swear to God.

1067
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:50,799
- Doris.
- I swear to fucking God!

1068
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,411
Doris.

1069
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:58,712
Doris, Doris, Doris.

1070
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,343
This is difficult for you.

1071
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,718
Listen.

1072
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:09,886
"'It's really a damn shame to tease you
so, my little whore, he laughed,

1073
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:13,124
'So, I will get the dildo
out of my cabinet in the next room.'

1074
01:28:13,255 --> 01:28:16,236
He was scarcely gone many
seconds before he returned,

1075
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:19,202
and I felt his fingers
opening the lips of my cunt.

1076
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:22,400
'Oh, oh, who is that?'
I screamed from under my skirt."

1077
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:23,852
I don't want to hear any of this.

1078
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:27,573
Just listen. No reaction.

1079
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:31,344
"Kiss her. Put your tongue
in her mouth, my boy.

1080
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:35,046
Fuck, fuck, fuck away."

1081
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,891
Rocks, covered in moss.

1082
01:28:46,021 --> 01:28:48,729
Fields, running around,
barbed wire.

1083
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,838
Open, storm...

1084
01:28:58,133 --> 01:29:01,080
Apples. Daddy, can you
pass the apples, please?

1085
01:29:01,203 --> 01:29:04,776
Cold, out at night.

1086
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:08,217
Meadow... open.

1087
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,913
Back again!

1088
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:17,296
- It's a hard, slow process.
- I just don't understand it.

1089
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:21,162
I don't either.
That's why we're here.

1090
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:33,945
Do not do that, please?

1091
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:36,948
Resume the exercise,
no matter what is said.

1092
01:29:39,608 --> 01:29:41,884
- What?
- You may talk to Clark.

1093
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,057
One minute.

1094
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,126
Whatever comes to your mind.

1095
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:49,126
True or false.

1096
01:29:50,786 --> 01:29:52,959
I don't want to say anything.

1097
01:29:53,088 --> 01:29:56,262
Then don't say anything.
Just look at him. One minute.

1098
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:58,930
Starting now.

1099
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,876
I want to fart in your face.

1100
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:18,821
I wish I could fart.
Because I'd fart in your face right now.

1101
01:30:24,286 --> 01:30:25,731
Um...

1102
01:30:27,823 --> 01:30:29,632
Wallpaper.

1103
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:31,259
Um...

1104
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:37,168
I don't know,
this is getting really hard.

1105
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,318
OK, all right.

1106
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,615
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1107
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,815
I don't know.

1108
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,484
How is this helping?

1109
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:57,421
You'll see.

1110
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:04,970
Doris.
She got rid of you, right?

1111
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:10,099
She saw you for what you are:
selfish and alone.

1112
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,303
You should go into the hospital
with your mother,

1113
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:16,677
because that's where you belong.

1114
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,911
Because you're sick,
and you're tired,

1115
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:23,318
and you need to be alone,
away from people.

1116
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,037
<i>How many people
you kill, dummy?

1117
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,340
<i>Are you drunk, dummy?

1118
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:50,643
<i>Did you blow them all up
and burn them?

1119
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:55,054
<i>Dummy, dummy, dummy.

1120
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,680
Can you stay still, dummy?

1121
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:02,853
Can you, dum-dum?

1122
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:05,896
Are you a loser?

1123
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:08,228
You lunkhead.

1124
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,108
Fail.

1125
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:19,872
- But...
- Fail.

1126
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:21,571
Mannequin...

1127
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,411
It's a fucking wall!

1128
01:32:55,537 --> 01:32:58,575
It's a fucking wall.
It's a fucking wall.

1129
01:32:58,707 --> 01:33:01,813
It's a fucking wall.
And I'm not in it.

1130
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:05,982
I'm not in it. It's a window
and I can leave any time I want.

1131
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:09,061
But I choose not to.
I choose to stay here.

1132
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,667
It's breathing.

1133
01:33:49,658 --> 01:33:52,764
<i>No matter what is said,
we do not react.

1134
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:55,864
Freddie, you may begin.

1135
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:04,178
I was on a ship that got
13 battle stars and won the war.

1136
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,342
What'd you do, dummy?

1137
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:19,396
<i>I can feel outside,
I can touch the neighbor's house.

1138
01:34:19,521 --> 01:34:23,867
I can touch the plants,
I can touch the stars,

1139
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:26,233
I can touch anything I want.

1140
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:30,142
And end of Application.

1141
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:35,281
- You're fucking with me.
- End of Application.

1142
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:38,213
- Freddie, open your eyes.
- It's a fucking wall!

1143
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:41,081
Open your eyes
and come back to me.

1144
01:34:57,325 --> 01:34:58,668
Very good.

1145
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,832
Very good.

1146
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:21,118
I am here to announce the first
Universal Congress of The Cause

1147
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:26,927
to be held May 21st, 1950,
in Phoenix, Arizona,

1148
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:29,228
a city named
for that glorious bird,

1149
01:35:29,357 --> 01:35:33,499
whose resurrection
from the ashes fits our own.

1150
01:35:33,628 --> 01:35:36,768
And it is here we will
present Book II.

1151
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:06,363
What's in it?

1152
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:11,962
My unpublished work.

1153
01:37:14,696 --> 01:37:16,334
My life's work.

1154
01:37:22,737 --> 01:37:25,479
Hold on. Hold on.

1155
01:37:39,654 --> 01:37:40,758
All right.

1156
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:16,099
Please, come and join us.

1157
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,933
Please, come get insight on
how to be freer, more productive,

1158
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:23,133
and more in command of your life.

1159
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:25,905
- Free yourself, ma'am.
- Don't...

1160
01:38:26,034 --> 01:38:29,811
Free yourself from past trauma.
Take command of your life, sir.

1161
01:38:29,938 --> 01:38:31,940
Would you care for
some free processing?

1162
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:37,285
Sir, would you care for some
free processing? It's free.

1163
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:39,119
Free yourself from past traumas.

1164
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,193
Free yourself from past trauma.

1165
01:38:41,316 --> 01:38:42,693
Free yourself from past trauma.

1166
01:38:42,817 --> 01:38:44,296
Take control of your life.

1167
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:46,262
Free yourself
from your ailments.

1168
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:48,424
Free yourself from your ailments.

1169
01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:50,117
Take control of your life, sir.

1170
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:52,195
Take control of your life.

1171
01:38:52,327 --> 01:38:54,364
You don't have to
change your faith

1172
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:56,941
or leave the congregation
you belong to.

1173
01:38:57,065 --> 01:38:59,944
So those interested in freedom
are urged to please come

1174
01:39:00,068 --> 01:39:03,880
for free sample processing sessions
in being younger, feeling freer,

1175
01:39:04,005 --> 01:39:06,144
and understanding
where you come from.

1176
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,151
It works.

1177
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:11,951
I added that.

1178
01:39:13,014 --> 01:39:15,255
- OK, ready?
- Is it in focus?

1179
01:39:16,584 --> 01:39:18,586
I was just asking.

1180
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,394
- Go ahead, snap away.
- OK.

1181
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:22,967
Ready?

1182
01:39:23,925 --> 01:39:25,871
One, two...

1183
01:39:48,383 --> 01:39:49,794
Thank you.

1184
01:40:54,749 --> 01:40:56,353
Hi, Helen.

1185
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:58,587
It's almost here.

1186
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,956
That's enough.

1187
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:06,297
That's enough now.

1188
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,422
You're gonna make me
red all over.

1189
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:12,761
Thank you. Thank you.

1190
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:17,966
Book II... is about man.

1191
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:24,342
And the title of the book
is The Split Saber.

1192
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:28,009
And here we have some answers.

1193
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:31,056
No more secrets.

1194
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:37,823
The source of all creation...

1195
01:42:40,388 --> 01:42:42,163
...good and evil...

1196
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,467
...and the source of all...

1197
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:51,401
...now, funny enough,
the source of all...

1198
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:54,803
...is you.

1199
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:07,523
I have unlocked...
and discovered

1200
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:12,757
a secret to living
in these bodies that we hold.

1201
01:43:14,055 --> 01:43:18,561
And, oh yes, it's very, very,

1202
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:22,072
- VERY, VERY SERIOUS.

1203
01:43:25,333 --> 01:43:26,573
The secret...

1204
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,806
...is laughter.

1205
01:43:40,181 --> 01:43:43,458
Now, I'd like to discuss
processing and communication.

1206
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,121
The art of listening,
if you will.

1207
01:44:25,293 --> 01:44:26,897
Bill.

1208
01:44:27,495 --> 01:44:28,838
Hello.

1209
01:44:32,233 --> 01:44:34,770
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1210
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:41,116
- You came from New York?
- New York City, yes.

1211
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:46,986
So, what do you think
of the book?

1212
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:54,295
What do you think about it?

1213
01:44:54,422 --> 01:44:56,493
I think it stinks.

1214
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:59,571
If it were up to me I'd chop this thing
down to a three-page pamphlet

1215
01:44:59,694 --> 01:45:02,504
and hand it to people
before they got on the subway.

1216
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:04,405
But I edited most of
his earlier work.

1217
01:45:04,532 --> 01:45:05,602
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1218
01:45:05,733 --> 01:45:07,303
- Outside?
- Let me say this,

1219
01:45:07,435 --> 01:45:09,813
the man is a grade-A mystic.

1220
01:45:09,937 --> 01:45:13,680
A true, original mystic
of the highest order.

1221
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:18,985
But his work is garbled and twisted,
and let me tell you...

1222
01:45:25,453 --> 01:45:28,525
What... What is this?

1223
01:46:17,004 --> 01:46:18,608
- Hello.
- Helen.

1224
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:21,447
- Author.
- Please.

1225
01:46:21,575 --> 01:46:24,988
- I've been reading the new book.
- What do you think?

1226
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:27,388
I think it's wonderful.

1227
01:46:27,515 --> 01:46:29,893
- Wait till you get to the good parts.
- Oh, yes.

1228
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:37,460
Well, as I've begun, I did notice
on page 13 there's a change.

1229
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:42,267
You've changed the
processing-platform question.

1230
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,933
Now it says,
"Can you imagine...?"

1231
01:46:48,869 --> 01:46:49,973
Yes.

1232
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,043
Yes.

1233
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:59,919
If our previous method was to induce
memory by asking, "Can you recall,"

1234
01:47:00,047 --> 01:47:02,688
doesn't it then change everything
if now we say, "Can you imagine?"

1235
01:47:02,817 --> 01:47:07,926
We are invoking a new, wider range
to account for the new data.

1236
01:47:08,055 --> 01:47:13,937
"Can you imagine," allows for a more
creative pathway to the mind.

1237
01:47:14,061 --> 01:47:15,665
More open.

1238
01:47:17,465 --> 01:47:19,604
- But if the new...
- What do you want?!

1239
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:22,505
Helen.

1240
01:47:26,307 --> 01:47:27,877
This is the new work.

1241
01:47:55,102 --> 01:47:56,706
Over here!

1242
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,814
The game is called
Pick-a-Point.

1243
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:08,393
You pick a point, drive straight at it,
as fast as you can.

1244
01:48:08,516 --> 01:48:10,723
I'll go first.

1245
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:13,798
I pick that winding road.

1246
01:48:39,547 --> 01:48:41,527
Good job, Daddy!

1247
01:48:47,588 --> 01:48:48,088
Ya-hoo!

1248
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:54,233
Whoo!

1249
01:49:09,843 --> 01:49:12,016
Whoo-hoo!

1250
01:49:14,782 --> 01:49:16,887
Whoo!

1251
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:20,956
Thrilling!

1252
01:49:22,089 --> 01:49:25,093
- Thrilling.

1253
01:49:28,762 --> 01:49:30,105
Freddie.

1254
01:49:34,368 --> 01:49:35,904
Pick a point.

1255
01:49:36,036 --> 01:49:37,709
Tell it to me.

1256
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:43,483
The rock...
The mountain.

1257
01:49:43,611 --> 01:49:45,522
The head.

1258
01:49:45,646 --> 01:49:47,455
It's the head of an alligator.

1259
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:49,060
Good.

1260
01:50:20,347 --> 01:50:23,453
Whoo! Freddie!
Go, Freddie!

1261
01:50:46,607 --> 01:50:49,110
He's going very fast.

1262
01:50:51,612 --> 01:50:54,354
- Good boy.

1263
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:22,248
Freddie!

1264
01:52:31,779 --> 01:52:33,315
- Hello?

1265
01:52:33,447 --> 01:52:35,290
Hello?

1266
01:52:38,619 --> 01:52:42,761
Mrs. Solstad,
I'm looking for Doris.

1267
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:44,233
Oh.

1268
01:52:45,993 --> 01:52:47,836
- What for?
- Because I'm looking for her,

1269
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:50,373
because I want to talk to her.
That's what for.

1270
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:53,876
Well, Doris is in Alabama right now.

1271
01:52:54,001 --> 01:52:59,508
- What's she doing in Alabama?
- Well, she's there with, um... Jim Day.

1272
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:03,816
They're married. He's in ROTC
training, Navy flight training.

1273
01:53:03,944 --> 01:53:05,787
- Jim Day?
- Mm-hm.

1274
01:53:05,913 --> 01:53:08,223
- Jim Day, Jim Day, that Jim Day?
- Yes.

1275
01:53:08,348 --> 01:53:12,057
- Jim Day from Somerville.
- Well, when'd that happen?

1276
01:53:12,186 --> 01:53:15,224
They've been married
for three years.

1277
01:53:15,355 --> 01:53:17,596
Is he still ugly?

1278
01:53:18,992 --> 01:53:20,994
She has two children.

1279
01:53:22,596 --> 01:53:24,337
Boys or girls?

1280
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:26,835
Two boys.

1281
01:53:28,936 --> 01:53:30,711
Are you coming back home?

1282
01:53:32,105 --> 01:53:34,085
No, I was just visiting.

1283
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,984
I thought I'd see
if she was around, say hello.

1284
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:39,351
How's your family doing?

1285
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:41,390
Yeah, all right.

1286
01:53:41,515 --> 01:53:45,725
Well, she's not here.

1287
01:53:47,554 --> 01:53:49,431
You could write her.
I have an address.

1288
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:52,230
I'm not gonna
write her a letter.

1289
01:53:52,359 --> 01:53:53,861
All right.

1290
01:53:58,498 --> 01:54:02,640
Was she upset last time I was here?
When I left her here?

1291
01:54:04,137 --> 01:54:06,083
- Yes.
- Was she broken up about it?

1292
01:54:07,975 --> 01:54:09,613
Yes.

1293
01:54:09,743 --> 01:54:13,247
- She told you what happened?
- Mm. Yeah.

1294
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:15,053
What'd she say?

1295
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:21,260
That you said that
you'd come back sometime.

1296
01:54:21,388 --> 01:54:23,390
Is that right?

1297
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:27,069
It was a long time ago.

1298
01:54:28,729 --> 01:54:29,901
Where have you been?

1299
01:54:31,331 --> 01:54:35,279
I been working.
Working, traveling.

1300
01:54:35,402 --> 01:54:38,906
I think I've been halfway around
the world since I last saw Doris.

1301
01:54:41,108 --> 01:54:42,781
How old is she now?

1302
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:44,912
Doris is 23.

1303
01:54:46,847 --> 01:54:48,690
'Cause I wanted to know.

1304
01:54:50,918 --> 01:54:53,364
You know, she was...

1305
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:56,397
She was too young when I...

1306
01:54:59,126 --> 01:55:01,265
Well, she's happy,
and that's good.

1307
01:55:04,531 --> 01:55:06,067
I'll tell her you came to see me.

1308
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:08,372
Ah, that's not gonna matter.

1309
01:55:09,469 --> 01:55:11,107
Give me a break.

1310
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:19,986
It was nice to see you.

1311
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:22,754
Am I leaving?

1312
01:55:24,418 --> 01:55:27,524
No. Whatever you'd like.
You can come in.

1313
01:55:27,654 --> 01:55:32,034
- Nah. I gotta go.
- OK.

1314
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:34,366
Thank you.

1315
01:55:34,494 --> 01:55:38,465
- How's Mr. Solstad?
- Why, he's very good.

1316
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:41,477
He's working, and...

1317
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:44,104
- Will you tell him I said hello?
- All right.

1318
01:55:48,175 --> 01:55:52,055
So, her name is Doris Day?
Like the Doris Day?

1319
01:55:52,179 --> 01:55:53,317
Yes.

1320
01:55:53,647 --> 01:55:56,685
- The movie star.
- Yes.

1321
01:56:00,357 --> 01:56:02,030
<i>Who are you?

1322
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:04,160
<i>My name is Casper.

1323
01:56:04,294 --> 01:56:07,673
<i>Hey, Casper.
Would you like to play pirate with me?

1324
01:56:07,797 --> 01:56:11,904
<i>Oh, boy! Would I!

1325
01:56:12,035 --> 01:56:14,675
<i>How are we gonna
tie this together, Casper?

1326
01:56:14,804 --> 01:56:17,375
<i>I found some rope.

1327
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:26,392
<i>Gee, Casper,
you're a tricky one.

1328
01:56:33,022 --> 01:56:35,002
Hello?

1329
01:56:35,125 --> 01:56:36,900
<i>I miss you.

1330
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,667
How'd you find me?

1331
01:56:40,797 --> 01:56:43,744
<i>We're tied together.

1332
01:56:43,867 --> 01:56:45,938
<i>Who got to you, Freddie?

1333
01:56:46,069 --> 01:56:49,448
<i>- What?
- Who got to you?

1334
01:56:49,572 --> 01:56:51,313
Nobody.

1335
01:56:53,176 --> 01:56:56,419
<i>Come to England.
You'll love it here.

1336
01:56:56,546 --> 01:56:59,527
<i>Andi think it'll do you some good.
Can you do it?

1337
01:56:59,649 --> 01:57:05,065
<i>- Where?
- We have a new school. It's in England.

1338
01:57:05,188 --> 01:57:07,293
Well, my spaceship's in the shop.

1339
01:57:07,424 --> 01:57:10,428
<i>You've still got it.

1340
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,699
<i>Would you bring me some Kools?

1341
01:57:12,829 --> 01:57:14,604
They don't have them there?

1342
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:17,678
<i>The only bad pan'
over here, no Kools.

1343
01:57:21,538 --> 01:57:22,915
How'd you find me?

1344
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:26,543
<i>Freddie, I have a matter
of such urgency,

1345
01:57:26,676 --> 01:57:29,213
<i>a matter that only you
can help me with.

1346
01:57:29,345 --> 01:57:32,986
<i>That may, in fact, cure
the insane once and for all.

1347
01:57:33,116 --> 01:57:35,221
<i>I can cure you.

1348
01:57:35,351 --> 01:57:37,388
<i>And I remember where we've met.

1349
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:41,900
<i>- Come to England. I'll tell you.

1350
01:57:42,025 --> 01:57:45,472
<i>Now, for the treasure!

1351
01:57:45,595 --> 01:57:49,702
<i>"X" marks the spot
where the sunken treasure is.

1352
01:57:52,602 --> 01:57:55,014
<i>Golly, Billy, there's the "X."

1353
01:57:55,138 --> 01:57:57,584
<i>I'll get the treasure, Casper.

1354
01:57:57,707 --> 01:58:02,053
<i>The captain never
leaves the ship. I'll get it.

1355
01:58:34,444 --> 01:58:36,685
Hello. Welcome.

1356
01:58:36,813 --> 01:58:39,384
Can we help you and
invite you to sit down?

1357
01:58:39,516 --> 01:58:41,723
You look like
you've traveled here.

1358
01:58:41,851 --> 01:58:45,196
- How else do you get someplace?

1359
01:58:45,321 --> 01:58:49,030
- Can I assist you in help?
- I'm here to see Master.

1360
01:58:49,158 --> 01:58:52,628
- And what's your name?
- Freddie Quell.

1361
01:58:52,762 --> 01:58:56,005
- Is he expecting you?
- He should be.

1362
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:02,881
I took that picture.

1363
01:59:25,628 --> 01:59:27,232
Hello, Freddie.

1364
01:59:28,398 --> 01:59:29,968
Val.

1365
01:59:31,067 --> 01:59:32,842
You look good.

1366
01:59:34,904 --> 01:59:36,542
Come on.

1367
01:59:42,045 --> 01:59:44,992
- Can I get this for you?
- No, thank you.

1368
01:59:50,587 --> 01:59:54,091
- How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

1369
02:00:31,294 --> 02:00:32,773
Hello.

1370
02:00:33,463 --> 02:00:34,874
Hi.

1371
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,880
Thank you.

1372
02:00:48,111 --> 02:00:49,419
Thank you.

1373
02:01:25,848 --> 02:01:27,623
Some place.

1374
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:35,463
Are you drunk?

1375
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:39,206
No. No, no.

1376
02:01:43,766 --> 02:01:46,212
You look sick.

1377
02:01:46,335 --> 02:01:48,337
Freddie, you don't look healthy.

1378
02:01:50,339 --> 02:01:53,479
I don't look like that.
That's not how I look.

1379
02:01:53,609 --> 02:01:56,146
You don't think you can?

1380
02:01:56,279 --> 02:01:58,088
It's just not how I look.

1381
02:02:01,150 --> 02:02:04,188
You can't take this life straight,
can you?

1382
02:02:11,294 --> 02:02:12,796
What do you want?

1383
02:02:15,965 --> 02:02:17,569
I don't know.

1384
02:02:20,002 --> 02:02:23,040
I had a dream...

1385
02:02:29,746 --> 02:02:31,657
Where's Elizabeth?

1386
02:02:33,716 --> 02:02:38,825
- DCF.
- Really? What is that?

1387
02:02:40,389 --> 02:02:44,098
What did you expect
would happen coming here?

1388
02:02:49,232 --> 02:02:51,439
I can take pictures...

1389
02:02:52,769 --> 02:02:54,578
...if you need them.

1390
02:02:56,506 --> 02:02:58,747
We don't need pictures, Freddie.

1391
02:03:01,611 --> 02:03:04,990
This is something you do
for a billion years or not at all.

1392
02:03:05,114 --> 02:03:07,458
This isn't fashion.

1393
02:03:16,526 --> 02:03:18,062
This is pointless.

1394
02:03:19,729 --> 02:03:22,107
He isn't interested
in getting better.

1395
02:03:36,579 --> 02:03:38,252
She's really softened up.

1396
02:03:48,825 --> 02:03:51,431
Free winds
and no tyranny for you?

1397
02:03:54,397 --> 02:03:55,842
Freddie...

1398
02:03:58,634 --> 02:04:03,344
...sailor of the seas.

1399
02:04:03,472 --> 02:04:05,179
You pay no rent.

1400
02:04:06,809 --> 02:04:08,982
Free to go where you please.

1401
02:04:14,317 --> 02:04:16,456
Then go.

1402
02:04:18,521 --> 02:04:23,971
Go to that landless latitude,
and good luck.

1403
02:04:27,363 --> 02:04:32,312
For if you figure a way to live
without serving a master...

1404
02:04:34,303 --> 02:04:35,873
...any master...

1405
02:04:37,607 --> 02:04:40,611
...then let the rest us know,
will you?

1406
02:04:42,979 --> 02:04:46,449
For you'd be the first person
in the history of the world.

1407
02:04:51,854 --> 02:04:57,827
In my dream, you said you'd...
you figured out where we met.

1408
02:05:01,564 --> 02:05:06,673
I went back and I found it.

1409
02:05:06,802 --> 02:05:09,408
I recalled you and I working together...

1410
02:05:10,873 --> 02:05:13,615
...in Paris.

1411
02:05:13,743 --> 02:05:16,781
We were members
of the Pigeon Post.

1412
02:05:16,913 --> 02:05:19,257
During a four and a half month siege

1413
02:05:19,382 --> 02:05:21,919
of the city by Prussian forces.

1414
02:05:23,586 --> 02:05:27,124
We worked and rigged balloons...

1415
02:05:27,256 --> 02:05:31,136
...that delivered mail
and secret messages...

1416
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:34,867
...across the communications blockade,

1417
02:05:34,997 --> 02:05:37,739
set up by the Prussians.

1418
02:05:37,867 --> 02:05:42,714
We sent 65 unguided mail balloons
and only two went missing.

1419
02:05:45,341 --> 02:05:47,446
In the worst winter on record.

1420
02:05:56,953 --> 02:05:58,398
Two.

1421
02:06:07,296 --> 02:06:10,675
If you leave here,
I don't ever want to see you again.

1422
02:06:20,209 --> 02:06:21,984
Or you can stay.

1423
02:06:28,884 --> 02:06:31,091
Maybe in the next life?

1424
02:06:33,389 --> 02:06:36,029
If we meet again
in the next life,

1425
02:06:36,158 --> 02:06:41,005
you will be my sworn enemy,
and I will show you no mercy.

1426
02:09:35,171 --> 02:09:38,050
Do you think you could just
look into my eyes and not blink,

1427
02:09:38,174 --> 02:09:41,314
and I'm gonna ask you some
questions that'll help you?

1428
02:09:41,443 --> 02:09:43,218
Maybe.

1429
02:09:43,345 --> 02:09:47,157
All right. Starting now.
You can't blink.

1430
02:09:47,283 --> 02:09:48,489
You just look in my eyes.

1431
02:09:48,617 --> 02:09:50,358
- You're already blinking.

1432
02:09:50,486 --> 02:09:52,727
Starting now, all right?
What's your name?

1433
02:09:52,855 --> 02:09:55,961
- I told you...
- No, just say your name.

1434
02:09:56,091 --> 02:09:57,900
You don't remember?

1435
02:09:58,027 --> 02:10:01,873
- Just say your name.
- You're drunk.

1436
02:10:01,997 --> 02:10:03,840
You have to say your name.
And you blinked,

1437
02:10:03,966 --> 02:10:06,879
infringement, back to the start.
Now, say your name.

1438
02:10:07,002 --> 02:10:08,640
Winn.

1439
02:10:08,771 --> 02:10:14,187
- Now say your full name.
- Winn Manchester.

1440
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:18,349
- Say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

1441
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:21,757
- Say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

1442
02:10:21,884 --> 02:10:25,388
- Now, say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

1443
02:10:25,521 --> 02:10:28,024
Have you ever lived before?

1444
02:10:29,725 --> 02:10:31,534
I don't know.

1445
02:10:34,363 --> 02:10:36,809
Maybe this isn't your only life.

1446
02:10:39,868 --> 02:10:43,406
- I hope it isn't.

1447
02:10:46,242 --> 02:10:48,051
You're the bravest girl
I've ever known.

1448
02:10:52,881 --> 02:10:55,157
Now stick it back in,
it fell out.

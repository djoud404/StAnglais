1
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,610
Guardian, this is Omaha 4-4
on heading 158 to Laredo.

2
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:39,310
Copy, Omaha 4-4.

3
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,402
I'm picking up movement
on the FLIR.

4
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,447
Coming in for a closer look.
Stand by.

5
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:26,400
This is the
United States Border Patrol.

6
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:29,447
Get on your knees
and put your hands up.

7
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,841
- Hey! Get down!
- I speak English.

8
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:33,494
I speak English. Get down!

9
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:35,168
Stay down!

10
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:36,192
Get down!

11
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:48,205
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

12
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:52,731
Get on your knees and
put your hands on your head.

13
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:19,366
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

14
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,108
Get on your knees.
Put your hands up.

15
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:29,159
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

16
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:39,212
Let me see your hands!

17
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,085
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

18
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,434
Show...!

19
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,959
Be advised.

20
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,502
There's been an explosion.

21
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:49,744
Officers are down.

22
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:05,978
Hey! Over here!

23
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:15,553
What do you got?

24
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,772
Prayer rugs.

25
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,856
Hey, honey. Yeah.

26
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,409
Stay here with me.
Just stay here.

27
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,716
It's okay.

28
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,720
Just come with me slowly
and quietly.

29
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,288
Stay here with me. Stay...
Oh, God.

30
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:39,550
You don't have to
do this.

31
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:43,032
You don't have
to do this, please.

32
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,603
The scene in
Kansas City tonight

33
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:51,518
is one of horror,
confusion and grief.

34
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,781
15 people,
among them two children,

35
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:56,045
are so far confirmed dead
with many more injured...

36
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,718
The victims' families remain...

37
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:59,352
Haunting images
of the attackers

38
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,920
are coming to light
from surveillance...

39
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,530
Secretary of Defense
James Riley

40
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:06,229
is expected to make a
statement on the attacks.

41
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:09,797
Our intense focus on recovery
and assisting the injured

42
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:11,886
and the families of
those who have been killed

43
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:14,106
is matched only by
our determination

44
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,847
to prevent more attacks.

45
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,158
A message to our attackers.

46
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,554
Your bombs do not terrify us.

47
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,556
They empower us.

48
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,170
They empower us
to send you something

49
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,431
that is truly terrifying:

50
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:37,869
the full weight of
the United States military.

51
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:15,749
Down, down,
down on the ground!

52
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:19,971
No! Here for what?!

53
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:21,581
I'm not the f-fighter!

54
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,887
Fighter!

55
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,339
How you doing?

56
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:33,502
You think I'm gonna
waterboard you, Bashiir?

57
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:41,226
Waterboarding is
when we can't torture.

58
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,663
This is Africa.

59
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,231
I can do whatever the fuck
I want here.

60
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:53,891
You're gonna answer
every question I ask you

61
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:56,110
without me harming
a hair on your head.

62
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:58,461
Do you want to know why?

63
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,468
Because if you don't...

64
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:11,865
...I'm gonna call in
an air strike on your house.

65
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,088
Nice pool, by the way.

66
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,090
Whoever said
crime doesn't pay

67
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,223
wasn't stealing oil tankers,
were they?

68
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:43,245
Those men are Yemeni.

69
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:45,856
We have nothing to do
with that.

70
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,555
Your fight is with ISIS,
not me.

71
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,732
All my fights are on water.

72
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:55,909
They sure are, Bashiir.

73
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,955
And Yemen?

74
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:03,526
Just across the gulf.

75
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,267
What a coincidence.

76
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:14,624
It's kind of tricky
for Yemeni nationalists

77
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:18,584
to book an international flight
these days, huh?

78
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:20,934
So, if their passports
were fake,

79
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,067
they'd fly straight
to Kansas City

80
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,635
instead of going to Mexico and
hiring coyotes to truck them

81
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,594
a hundred miles
to the desert, right?

82
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:34,383
So, the big question is:
how'd they get to Mexico?

83
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:36,428
'Cause they sure as hell
didn't fly.

84
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:43,479
No, they... traveled by ship.

85
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,568
A ship you didn't
try and steal.

86
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:50,094
So that means
someone paid you not to.

87
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:54,316
So, here's my only question,
Bashiir.

88
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,057
Who paid you
to let the ship through?

89
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:28,306
Is that your brother?

90
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,048
'Cause I don't want
to kill the pool guy.

91
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,793
- Every ship smuggles people.
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:40,405
And they don't need
my permission.

93
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:44,017
Yes, they fucking do.

94
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:47,891
Last chance.

95
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:50,154
- This is a bluff.
- No.

96
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:52,896
You American.

97
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,986
You have too many rules.

98
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,989
No rules today, sport,
just orders.

99
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,557
Go ahead, sir. You're green.

100
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:03,254
Roger that.

101
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,125
No, no, no, no, no.

102
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,563
No, I want you to watch it.
I want you to watch it.

103
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,303
Watch.

104
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,679
You have a big family,
Bashiir.

105
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,507
Lots of brothers.

106
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,987
You should've chosen
another line of work.

107
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:44,730
I could do this all day.

108
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:46,863
But sooner or later,

109
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:49,605
I'll get the brother
you can't live without.

110
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,567
I promise.

111
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,327
It's one more thing

112
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:59,702
pointing to the cartels.

113
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,767
Now, the money came from
Quassim Al-Raymi's camp,

114
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,227
which isn't a surprise.

115
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,881
The ship, on the other hand,

116
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,274
is a Panamanian freighter,
La Victorina,

117
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:10,364
registered to the Mexican
holding company Grupo Duro.

118
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,543
It docked at Port of Veracruz
on the 18th.

119
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,458
Carlos Reyes' company.

120
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:18,590
The one and only.

121
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:19,983
If you need Matt home,

122
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:22,202
I can get him out
at 0600 tomorrow.

123
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:24,596
I'll have a plane
to Washington

124
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,468
ready for you in an hour.

125
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,383
See you tomorrow, Matt.

126
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:32,909
Smuggling terrorists seems
pretty short-sighted to me.

127
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,912
Border's gonna tighten
like a vice now.

128
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:39,437
What happened to the price
of cocaine after 9/11, Ken?

129
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:41,744
Tight borders
are good for business.

130
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,638
Let's go.

131
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,727
Will you be home by 3:00?

132
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,444
I have to stay late
for the science fair.

133
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,643
Do you want me
to pick you up?

134
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,079
I'll take the bus. Okay.

135
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:18,737
Let's go.

136
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,616
It's pretty good.

137
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:16,926
How much they make?

138
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,147
For lookout?

139
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,977
20, 30 a day.

140
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,675
Man, but that's
all they're worth.

141
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:30,156
But you...

142
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,595
well, shit, you know
both sides of the river.

143
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,989
You got a passport.
Come and go as you please.

144
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:43,213
Rafa!

145
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,658
Eh.

146
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:58,881
Fat ass.

147
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,412
What's going on?

148
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:05,931
Hide the beer.

149
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:19,031
You can name
your own price, you know.

150
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,339
Hmm?

151
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:24,776
This is the border.

152
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,779
The Matamoros Cartel
pay people well to work it.

153
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:35,091
You can, uh...

154
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,441
start making your earn
with me, cousin.

155
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,837
Take it.

156
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,853
It's yours.

157
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:10,300
So, what do I have to do?

158
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:24,314
You really ought to invest
in a little sunscreen, Matt.

159
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,490
If you guys would start wars
someplace cloudy,

160
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:28,057
I wouldn't have to.

161
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:37,022
DOJ get an ID
on those other suicide bombers?

162
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:39,851
Not yet. Uh, might want to get on that.

163
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:41,635
There's proof Reyes Cartel

164
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,290
helped one of them
get to the border, so...

165
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:46,075
we know enough
to move forward.

166
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:50,383
Mr. Secretary...

167
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:52,298
Matt Graver.

168
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:54,344
Have a seat.

169
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:11,535
What do you think is
the most valuable commodity

170
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,580
that cartels move
across our borders?

171
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,281
20 years ago, cocaine.

172
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:21,719
Uh, today I'd have to say
it'd be people.

173
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:25,114
It's a resource they don't
have to cultivate or process

174
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,637
and if they don't
make it across,

175
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:27,986
they can pay to cross again

176
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,683
at three times
the price of a kilo.

177
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:35,907
How would you define terrorism,
Mr. Graver?

178
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,388
I think that's your job, sir.

179
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:44,655
The current definition is
"Any individual or group

180
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:47,876
that uses violence
to achieve a political goal."

181
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,661
The administration
believes that

182
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:53,446
the drug cartels
now fit that definition.

183
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,623
Next week, the president's
adding drug cartels

184
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:59,191
to the list
of terrorist organizations.

185
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,019
You can understand
how that will

186
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:03,935
expand our ability
to combat them.

187
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,632
The cartel territories

188
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:07,045
are fairly stable
at the moment,

189
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,549
but as we learned in Iraq,

190
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:12,161
striking your enemy is
a whole hell of a lot easier

191
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,728
if they're fighting
each other.

192
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:19,646
I'll do whatever you need.

193
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,997
Just point the way.

194
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,304
Do you have any thoughts?

195
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:28,481
I mean, I wouldn't take out
a cartel leader.

196
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,919
Turn one cartel into 50.

197
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,835
Besides, killing kings doesn't
start wars, it ends them.

198
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:35,924
That's our concern.
Mm-hmm.

199
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,188
You have a location on Reyes?

200
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,494
No, but the family's
under surveillance.

201
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,279
Is he in contact with them?

202
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,716
Not to our knowledge,
but we assume yes.

203
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,719
- Any kids?
- Two.

204
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,112
What's the age
of the youngest?

205
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:51,504
Sixteen.

206
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:52,941
Sixteen?

207
00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:00,470
Yeah, if you want to
start a war...

208
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:01,906
kidnap a prince.

209
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,169
King will start it for you.

210
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:10,349
You did this sort of thing
in the Middle East.

211
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:11,873
Hmm.

212
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:15,485
You think those tactics
will work here?

213
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,791
If you want it to, sir.

214
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:31,240
Boots on the ground, you're
gonna hire on the outside.

215
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:32,934
And the same goes
for your supply train

216
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,983
and for air support.

217
00:21:35,157 --> 00:21:37,246
And I don't need
to remind you

218
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,597
what happens if they figure out
that it's us.

219
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:46,429
Just to be clear,

220
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:49,127
you want to see
this thing through,

221
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:52,304
I'm gonna have to get...
dirty.

222
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:58,832
Dirty is exactly why
you're here.

223
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:05,274
What do you need?

224
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:06,840
Everything.

225
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:09,104
Drones with
attack capability...

226
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,149
You have Black Hawks, right? Mm-hmm.

227
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,586
I want two of those.
I need logistics,

228
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,850
communications equipment
compatible with a SOCOM JCU.

229
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,852
First phase,
I need a strike team,

230
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:21,290
two snipers,
I need a demolition team...

231
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:23,118
Are you going to Ukraine?

232
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,902
I got Russians on the payroll,
brother.

233
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:26,643
Don't put me
in that position.

234
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:30,473
Where's the coup?

235
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,388
It's an extraction...

236
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:33,650
for starters.

237
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,087
How much can I know?

238
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:38,785
Brother, you don't
want to know.

239
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,180
Well, I don't need specifics,

240
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:44,356
but I have to know
where they're going.

241
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:49,405
Mexico.

242
00:22:52,277 --> 00:22:53,472
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

243
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:55,237
It's not the government.

244
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:58,066
It's cartel.

245
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:01,286
Treasury cutting the checks?

246
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,854
Eh, under a company in Brazil
called Rio Verde.

247
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,343
If it's constant action,

248
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:17,085
I'm ten mil a month
in payroll and supplies.

249
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,739
At least.

250
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:23,656
I want 150 over cost
and immunity.

251
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,705
Done.

252
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:31,119
Congratulations, you can afford
your own hockey team now.

253
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:01,031
You'll be easy to shop for
at Christmas.

254
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,818
I don't celebrate Christmas.

255
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:11,084
Well, I bet you will
this year.

256
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,912
What'd they do?

257
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:14,653
Doesn't matter.

258
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:25,098
No rules this time.

259
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:28,450
I'm turning you loose.

260
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:33,237
How loose?

261
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,849
Carlos Reyes.

262
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:41,245
How's that for loose?

263
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:47,077
It's your chance
to get even for your family.

264
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,347
You're gonna help us
start a war.

265
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,436
With who?

266
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:03,136
Everyone.

267
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,654
Aah! Aah...

268
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:52,098
Aah!

269
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,045
Adios.

270
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:04,823
This would have been a lot
easier taking her in the house.

271
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:08,218
Could get real sloppy
on the street.

272
00:29:08,392 --> 00:29:09,872
Sloppy's good.

273
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,766
Sloppy makes it look like
the cartel did it.

274
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,275
All right,
let's go.

275
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,542
She started it.

276
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:13,631
Miss Reyes?

277
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:19,942
She called me a narco
whore and slapped me, so I hit her.

278
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,510
What would you do?

279
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:24,512
You.

280
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:26,557
Go to the nurse.

281
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,040
No, you're not
going anywhere.

282
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:33,042
Sit.

283
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,531
Now what am I going
to do with you?

284
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:46,969
She deserved
what she got.

285
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:48,884
It's not your place to do it.

286
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:51,408
Fine.

287
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:54,280
You beat the shit out of her.

288
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:57,806
I should expel you.

289
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:01,026
Do it.

290
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,820
That's what I thought.

291
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,623
How we looking?

292
00:31:32,797 --> 00:31:35,104
Got eyes on the prize?

293
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:37,062
Roger.

294
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,456
Prize is in the tail vehicle.

295
00:32:58,404 --> 00:32:59,797
No!

296
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,584
No! No! No!

297
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:01,772
Where we going? Go straight to the plane.

298
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,402
Don't worry about the vehicle.
We'll take care of it.

299
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:04,514
All right.

300
00:34:12,174 --> 00:34:14,334
All right, you're
gonna drive that to the mall.

301
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,048
Keys are in the gas flap.
You just leave them there.

302
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,877
All right. Then you go see
what's waiting for you.

303
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,671
Where you got us? Building 5, sir.

304
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:00,673
You're gonna take a left.
I know where it is.

305
00:36:25,524 --> 00:36:28,136
Now walk me through
what I'm watching here.

306
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,791
This is a map of Mexico
on a hundred-mile grids.

307
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:32,749
And you took
the subject here.

308
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:35,317
Speculation is Reyes
has a family residence

309
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:38,189
somewhere near Monterrey.

310
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,409
Has the Mexican police
responded yet?

311
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,412
Yeah, local, state and federal
police are all there now.

312
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:46,110
Satellite cannot
pick up cell chatter.

313
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:47,982
Okay. Yeah, we can lock coordinates

314
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:49,810
to the cell
and snag the phone number,

315
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:51,004
but we can't hear the call.

316
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:52,856
Give me a satellite feed

317
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,336
of the house in Mexico City.

318
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,338
Yeah, you got it.

319
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:58,514
What we're hoping for is
a call from this location

320
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:00,472
to start a trail.

321
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:01,798
Any family
members in the house?

322
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:03,171
No, just staff.

323
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:06,261
Teenage girl with
her own 30-room mansion.

324
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:09,568
I wish I was a teenage girl.

325
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:11,614
Pull up the incident site.

326
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,012
It looks
like you popped them all.

327
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:20,231
No, we only engaged one.

328
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,843
One died in the crash, and
the other two we tied and left.

329
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:25,062
That's a pretty big risk.
Why do that?

330
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:28,109
Just to see what they'd do.

331
00:37:28,283 --> 00:37:30,589
Back it up.
Show me earlier.

332
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:32,083
A minute just after we left.Yeah.

333
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:37,248
Keep going.

334
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,033
All right, there, good.

335
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:45,802
We have new audio
coming in on the black phone.

336
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:49,607
Copy that.

337
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:09,063
Call is not coming
from the house,

338
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:11,239
it's coming from that fucker
right there.

339
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:12,893
Give me a live feed
and find him.

340
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,895
On it.

341
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:19,508
Phone!

342
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:21,336
Lock in on it.

343
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,599
All right, locking now.

344
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:26,123
Data link up. There's the king.

345
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:28,778
There it is.
Start tracking.

346
00:38:28,952 --> 00:38:29,952
Come on.

347
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:31,389
Tracking on two.

348
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:33,163
Stand by. We got three.

349
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:17,087
Por favor.

350
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:27,793
Por favor.

351
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:43,347
Get down! Police! Get down!

352
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:45,828
Hands where I can see 'em! Move! Move!

353
00:40:49,005 --> 00:40:51,094
Clear!

354
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:52,356
Clear!

355
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:21,559
We got another one here!

356
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:29,176
A-Are you okay?

357
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,873
Are we clear?

358
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:33,397
All clear!

359
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:35,878
It's okay.

360
00:41:36,052 --> 00:41:39,055
Let's go. It's okay.

361
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:41,101
It's okay.

362
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:44,713
It's okay. It's okay.

363
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:47,933
It's okay.

364
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,966
Am I in Texas?

365
00:42:23,665 --> 00:42:25,275
Yeah, we are.

366
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:32,804
What do you want us
to call you?

367
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:37,809
Isabel.
Isabel.

368
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:41,726
I need to ask you
a question.

369
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,256
Did they hurt you?

370
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:57,220
What happened here?

371
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:07,187
I got in a fight at school.

372
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:13,802
So when do I get
to go back home?

373
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:16,152
Well, we still need
to work through some things

374
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:18,633
to make sure we understand
all the circumstances

375
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,809
surrounding
your abduction, okay?

376
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:22,419
But you're safe.

377
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:28,033
So hang in there, we're gonna
get you home very soon.

378
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:37,347
Alicia will look after you.

379
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,350
And if you need anything,
just ask her.

380
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:22,044
We put the girl in the middle
of Matamoros territory,

381
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:23,741
and Reyes will start
the fireworks.

382
00:44:23,915 --> 00:44:27,136
What's a good spot
where we can leave her?

383
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,052
We'll hold her in a federal
police depot in Méndez.

384
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:31,836
We're deep enough
in Matamoros land

385
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,621
that they'll have
to fight their way out

386
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:35,927
if they come looking for her.

387
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,585
Where do I say you found her?

388
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,805
Oh, say we raided a safe house
in Brownsville

389
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:45,502
and found her there.

390
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:47,765
Matamoros Cartel is
very strong in this area.

391
00:44:47,939 --> 00:44:49,700
Reyes will have trouble
getting his men through.

392
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:51,073
Ah, they'll let
his men through.

393
00:44:51,247 --> 00:44:52,767
Getting back out
will be their problem.

394
00:44:54,642 --> 00:44:56,470
When would you
bring her across?

395
00:44:56,644 --> 00:44:58,210
Well, now that
we got the cartels

396
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:00,225
at each other's throats,
the sooner the better.

397
00:45:00,387 --> 00:45:01,388
Secret won't keep long.

398
00:45:01,562 --> 00:45:03,520
Uh, there's no secrets
in Mexico.

399
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:05,087
Why do you think
I'm driving armor?

400
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:06,828
Can you get me cleared
for that?

401
00:45:07,002 --> 00:45:08,873
Will do.

402
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:11,441
Federal police will meet you
at the border with an escort.

403
00:45:11,615 --> 00:45:15,837
Thanks.

404
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:33,158
Still amazes me.

405
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,466
The appetite of this place.

406
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,990
Yeah, well,
welcome to America.

407
00:45:41,558 --> 00:45:42,994
You all right?

408
00:45:43,168 --> 00:45:44,996
What the fuck?!

409
00:45:59,141 --> 00:46:01,535
Hey! Why don't you
keep your fucking eyes peeled?

410
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:07,018
Ah, you can't even tell
they're gangbangers anymore.

411
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:45,317
I've got a problem.

412
00:46:45,492 --> 00:46:47,929
Either be home before dawn
or my dad will get mad.

413
00:46:48,103 --> 00:46:50,845
Oh, get the fuck out, dude, no.
No, no, no.

414
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:53,978
You got a new daddy now.
All right?

415
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:56,590
When you meet him,
act like a fucking man.

416
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,636
You ready to be a man,
right?

417
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,033
All right, yes, dude.
All right.

418
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:22,616
Just wait here till
I come get you, all right?

419
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,900
Come on.

420
00:48:32,468 --> 00:48:34,252
No. ¿No?

421
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:11,637
Sí.

422
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:21,561
Sí.

423
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:40,928
How you feeling?

424
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,433
I'd feel better
if someone actually told me

425
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:50,067
what was going on.

426
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:52,330
We're turning you over
to the Mexican Army.

427
00:49:52,504 --> 00:49:54,637
They'll arrange to take you
back to your father.

428
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,641
Let's go.

429
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:26,800
I'm gonna need you
to put this on.

430
00:50:42,163 --> 00:50:44,731
Load up!

431
00:50:44,905 --> 00:50:46,471
Loading up! Heads up!

432
00:51:14,064 --> 00:51:16,501
I have seven Mexican police vehicles

433
00:51:16,676 --> 00:51:18,286
located at the border
checkpoint waiting.

434
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,070
They're moving and forming up

435
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,985
in your configuration
at this time.

436
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:43,833
It's a nice day
for a drive, huh?

437
00:51:44,007 --> 00:51:45,443
Ah, beautiful day.

438
00:51:45,617 --> 00:51:47,141
Blue skies,
large-caliber weapons.

439
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:50,231
I love getting out
of the office.

440
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:52,712
Air, how are we looking?

441
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:54,539
Clear on both sides.

442
00:51:56,628 --> 00:51:58,369
You see no vehicles?

443
00:51:58,543 --> 00:52:00,023
Nothing but desert.

444
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:01,808
You're clear.

445
00:52:03,374 --> 00:52:05,637
What's your field of view?

446
00:52:05,812 --> 00:52:08,075
Ten miles in every direction.

447
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:10,468
Mexico Feds said
that the road would be clear.

448
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:12,427
Looks like they're
keeping their word.

449
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:14,241
All right, copy that.

450
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,397
Why weren't we stopped
at the border?

451
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:29,400
'Cause I'm special.

452
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,795
I thought you were policemen.

453
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:34,362
You're soldiers.

454
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,559
You know, we saved you...
why don't you just sit back

455
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,237
and be grateful.

456
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,199
Oscar-One, paved road ends

457
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:46,678
half a mile ahead.

458
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,680
Wait, what?

459
00:52:48,855 --> 00:52:50,770
Paved road ends
in half a klick.

460
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:52,510
Road isn't paved ahead.

461
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:54,556
You got your thermal?
Yeah, in my bag

462
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,037
in the back; you gotta take the wheel.
All right.

463
00:52:58,603 --> 00:52:59,909
Got it.

464
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,260
Oh, shit.

465
00:53:12,313 --> 00:53:14,402
Nothing's ever easy.

466
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:17,187
I got it.

467
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,449
Shit.

468
00:53:18,623 --> 00:53:20,538
I got no vis.

469
00:53:20,712 --> 00:53:22,540
This fucker's speeding up.

470
00:53:22,714 --> 00:53:24,978
Well, he's not stupid.
Stay on his ass.

471
00:53:27,807 --> 00:53:29,939
Dirt roads make me nervous.

472
00:54:11,807 --> 00:54:13,461
Air, I'm blind here.

473
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:15,463
Road's clear.

474
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:17,726
No vehicles, no movement,
left or right.

475
00:54:23,732 --> 00:54:25,777
All right, anything?

476
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:28,302
Shit. Oscar-One,
incoming on your right.

477
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:29,912
Air, I see nothing. Contact right.

478
00:54:30,086 --> 00:54:31,479
I don't see anything.

479
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:34,351
All down! Down!

480
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,152
Stuck! I'm stuck!

481
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:01,770
Aw, come on!

482
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:03,641
West side, hundred meters!

483
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:05,078
Take him out!

484
00:55:05,252 --> 00:55:06,652
Roger that. Heads down!

485
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:08,820
Heads down!

486
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:13,042
We're stuck. We're stuck.

487
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:18,787
Go! Go, go!

488
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:33,035
Cease fire! Cease fire!

489
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,915
Clear!

490
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:47,484
Clear.

491
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:48,658
Drop your weapon!

492
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:49,791
Them, over there. Sir!

493
00:56:54,274 --> 00:56:56,363
Spread out!

494
00:57:01,281 --> 00:57:02,673
Put 'em down, guys!

495
00:57:02,847 --> 00:57:04,197
Easy, easy.

496
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:08,462
- !Abajo!
- Ayuda.

497
00:57:08,636 --> 00:57:10,476
Easy, guys, easy.

498
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:12,466
Down. Down.! Ayuda!

499
00:57:33,356 --> 00:57:34,966
Fuck!

500
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:36,794
Shit.

501
00:57:36,968 --> 00:57:39,362
Fuckin' Mexican police
shot me?

502
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:41,190
You all right?

503
00:57:41,364 --> 00:57:42,844
Oh, shit.

504
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:45,020
I'm good.
It caught the plate.

505
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:47,544
All right. We clear?

506
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:50,199
Sir! We have police vehicles
approaching from the south.

507
00:57:50,373 --> 00:57:51,592
Five klicks out.

508
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:54,203
All right, load up!

509
00:57:54,377 --> 00:57:56,075
Come on, load up!

510
00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:06,085
Where is she?

511
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:10,524
New mission!

512
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:12,134
Gather round! New mission!

513
00:58:12,308 --> 00:58:14,658
Uh... no time for that.

514
00:58:14,832 --> 00:58:17,226
Head north. I'll find her.

515
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,839
Okay. Go.

516
00:58:22,013 --> 00:58:24,190
All right, we got company
three klicks out,

517
00:58:24,364 --> 00:58:25,669
coming from the south.

518
00:58:25,843 --> 00:58:27,671
Grab that Humvee,
pull this thing out.

519
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:28,845
Go! Now! Now!

520
00:58:30,718 --> 00:58:32,850
Come on, guys! Now!

521
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:35,157
Go, go! Let's go!

522
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:36,941
Let's go! Move it!

523
00:58:59,442 --> 00:59:00,704
Take this.

524
00:59:00,878 --> 00:59:03,751
All right?

525
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:06,014
Send me a signal
when you get to the border,

526
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,450
we'll come and get you.

527
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:08,973
All right?

528
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:13,413
Let's go, let's go!
Let's move it!

529
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:27,427
All right,
everyone in their vehicles!

530
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,414
Air, we need a medivac
from rally point alpha.

531
00:59:58,588 --> 01:00:00,721
Contact 47th med at Laughlin.

532
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,636
Roger that, Oscar-One.

533
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,725
Be advised,
you have police vehicles

534
01:00:04,899 --> 01:00:06,179
approaching your six
in a Code 3.

535
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:07,510
Oh, that's great.

536
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:09,338
Police approaching
our six fast.

537
01:00:11,035 --> 01:00:13,081
Air, we need a lane clear
at the border.

538
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:14,952
No bullshit.
Anybody gets in our way,

539
01:00:15,126 --> 01:00:16,246
we drive right through them.

540
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:38,933
Border coming up fast.
Border.

541
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:21,104
!Oye!

542
01:01:22,716 --> 01:01:23,716
!Oye!

543
01:01:25,022 --> 01:01:26,285
!Oye!

544
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:40,342
Isabel?

545
01:01:58,012 --> 01:01:59,012
No!

546
01:02:00,101 --> 01:02:01,363
No!

547
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:26,388
Get in.

548
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:47,556
Who kidnapped me?

549
01:03:55,303 --> 01:03:57,566
Your father
has a lot of enemies.

550
01:04:01,222 --> 01:04:03,267
And you're one of them?

551
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:06,488
Yes, I am.

552
01:04:21,155 --> 01:04:23,766
You're gonna need stitches.
Yeah. Lucky for me,

553
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,465
I'll still need
them tomorrow.

554
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:28,989
Miss Sunshine on your six.

555
01:04:29,163 --> 01:04:31,557
Hi. Fuckin' Mondays, huh?

556
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:36,518
Can we go somewhere
that's private?

557
01:04:37,693 --> 01:04:38,999
All right.

558
01:04:39,173 --> 01:04:41,567
Can you give me a sec?
Ma'am.

559
01:04:45,266 --> 01:04:46,506
My source is
with her right now.

560
01:04:46,572 --> 01:04:48,051
She'll be back in an hour.

561
01:04:48,225 --> 01:04:49,662
That's not what
I'm talking about.

562
01:04:49,836 --> 01:04:51,228
It was a green on blue,
Cynthia.

563
01:04:51,402 --> 01:04:52,621
There was no other option.

564
01:04:52,795 --> 01:04:54,536
You wanted Afghanistan,
now you got it.

565
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,016
This isn't Afghanistan.

566
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,887
This is our fucking neighbor!

567
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,456
There are 54 million Americans
with relatives there,

568
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,502
Mm-hmm. and they're all sitting around

569
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:06,722
watching footage
of dead Mexican police

570
01:05:06,896 --> 01:05:09,508
on Fox News. The police were the ambush.

571
01:05:09,682 --> 01:05:11,205
Oh, yeah, okay. We had no choice.

572
01:05:11,379 --> 01:05:13,033
All... They attacked us.

573
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:14,730
Doesn't matter.

574
01:05:14,904 --> 01:05:16,464
POTUS doesn't have
the stomach for this.

575
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:17,994
He shut us down.

576
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:20,301
What did you say? We're shut down.

577
01:05:22,129 --> 01:05:23,870
I did my fuckin' job.
You do yours.

578
01:05:24,044 --> 01:05:26,089
You sit that
fuckin' coward down,

579
01:05:26,263 --> 01:05:29,876
and you explain to him...
this is how we win.

580
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:31,399
He's not worried
about winning.

581
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:34,141
He's worried about
being fucking impeached,

582
01:05:34,315 --> 01:05:36,665
because you killed
two dozen Mexican police.

583
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:38,406
Who worked for Reyes.

584
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,713
Spin it. Do your job.

585
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:42,715
This only strengthens
our position.

586
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:44,543
We don't have a position,
Matt.

587
01:05:44,717 --> 01:05:47,023
Because we're not supposed
to fucking be there.

588
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:49,852
Your objective was to start
a war with Mexican cartels,

589
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:52,333
not with
the Mexican government.

590
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:53,900
You know what?

591
01:05:54,074 --> 01:05:55,945
This-this is why
nothing ever changes.

592
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:59,122
You think change
is the goal? Really?

593
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:02,082
You've been doing this too long
to believe that.

594
01:07:42,617 --> 01:07:44,140
Sí.

595
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:24,937
Why didn't you hold her
someplace in Mexico?

596
01:09:25,111 --> 01:09:27,156
We don't have the
infrastructure for that, sir.

597
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,050
Mission security
would be almost impossible.

598
01:09:29,115 --> 01:09:30,681
Was this your mission? No, sir.

599
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:32,379
Then why are you answering?

600
01:09:32,553 --> 01:09:35,295
Mr. Graver?

601
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:37,776
We don't have the
infrastructure for that, sir.

602
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:40,691
Mission security
would be almost impossible.

603
01:09:46,306 --> 01:09:49,483
And this girl was witness to
all aspects of the mission,

604
01:09:49,657 --> 01:09:52,616
correct? No, she was shielded
from the kidnapping.

605
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:55,315
What about the 25
Mexican police officers

606
01:09:55,489 --> 01:09:57,186
that were killed,
on foreign soil,

607
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,275
all of which she witnessed?

608
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:01,538
The ones who attacked us?
Yes, sir.

609
01:10:04,237 --> 01:10:06,369
Where is she?

610
01:10:06,543 --> 01:10:09,677
I have a source
bringing her to the border.

611
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:11,984
Do we have an exact location?

612
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:15,901
That question is for you, Mr. Forsing.

613
01:10:17,554 --> 01:10:19,165
We don't know
her whereabouts, sir,

614
01:10:19,339 --> 01:10:21,080
but he has a beacon...
he'll activate it

615
01:10:21,254 --> 01:10:23,169
as soon as he gets close
to the border.

616
01:10:23,343 --> 01:10:25,780
If they can make it
to the border.

617
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:28,870
Which is a chance
we cannot take.

618
01:10:30,698 --> 01:10:32,743
Cynthia.

619
01:10:32,918 --> 01:10:34,267
Yes, sir?

620
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:38,227
You handle it from here.

621
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,376
We can't risk her falling
into the wrong hands.

622
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,508
When the beacon's activated,

623
01:10:58,682 --> 01:11:00,249
your team takes them.

624
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:01,511
You understand?

625
01:11:04,384 --> 01:11:06,908
Clean the scene.

626
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:09,563
When I say clean, gentlemen,
I mean spotless.

627
01:11:09,737 --> 01:11:11,565
Your operative included.

628
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:18,702
Do you know...

629
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:21,531
how hard he was to make?

630
01:11:21,705 --> 01:11:23,751
I could throw a stick
across the river

631
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:26,319
and hit 50 grieving fathers.

632
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:28,364
Make another one.

633
01:11:28,538 --> 01:11:30,497
Can't do that.

634
01:11:30,671 --> 01:11:33,108
Well, look who doesn't have
the stomach for it now.

635
01:11:33,282 --> 01:11:35,197
Oh, who are you
to question me

636
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,373
after all the shit
that I've eaten for you?

637
01:11:37,547 --> 01:11:41,595
We ID'd
the other bombers, Matt.

638
01:11:41,769 --> 01:11:43,553
They're U.S. citizens.

639
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:45,816
They're from New Jersey.
Doesn't change anything.

640
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:47,949
It changes
the fucking narrative!

641
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:56,365
Hey.

642
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:57,801
Hey.

643
01:12:57,976 --> 01:12:59,499
You got the girl?

644
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,240
She's with me now, yeah.

645
01:13:03,155 --> 01:13:05,026
They want me to cut ties.

646
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,202
You got to get rid of her.

647
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:14,731
I can't do that.

648
01:13:14,905 --> 01:13:16,907
What are you telling me?

649
01:13:17,082 --> 01:13:19,258
Not this one.

650
01:13:21,086 --> 01:13:23,131
Help me get her across,

651
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:25,438
and we can decide
what to do with her.

652
01:13:25,612 --> 01:13:29,224
Uh-uh. Don't put me
in that situation.

653
01:13:29,398 --> 01:13:32,097
If they're cutting ties,
you're already in that situation.

654
01:13:36,797 --> 01:13:39,104
If she stays here,
she'll be killed.

655
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:43,630
Help me get her across.

656
01:13:49,331 --> 01:13:51,594
I can't help you do that.

657
01:14:00,299 --> 01:14:02,736
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

658
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,955
I'll figure it out.

659
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,658
Good luck.

660
01:15:15,113 --> 01:15:17,767
I got to get you north.

661
01:16:05,075 --> 01:16:06,903
See, the flashing light
is you.

662
01:16:07,077 --> 01:16:08,905
All right? That red line,

663
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:10,429
that's your path.

664
01:16:10,603 --> 01:16:12,170
Okay. Don't get that wet.

665
01:16:22,615 --> 01:16:24,834
Keep it safe for a bit.

666
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:33,626
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

667
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,019
They're sheep.

668
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:38,326
Treat them like it.

669
01:17:02,742 --> 01:17:04,396
!Rápido!

670
01:17:12,752 --> 01:17:14,319
!Vámonos!

671
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,826
Follow the trail to the road.

672
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,741
Your ride's waiting.

673
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,548
It's okay.

674
01:18:53,722 --> 01:18:55,333
Come on.

675
01:19:13,176 --> 01:19:15,831
Show me a job that pays better
and I'll do it.

676
01:19:17,529 --> 01:19:19,357
Where are you headed, baby?

677
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:21,335
Get me to the
grocery store on Trenton.

678
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:22,795
I can walk from there.

679
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:47,472
Why does a soldier know
sign language?

680
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,477
My daughter was deaf.

681
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:03,009
I know who you are.

682
01:20:07,187 --> 01:20:10,495
You're the attorney
whose family they killed.

683
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,109
Not "they."

684
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:26,293
My father.

685
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:28,687
A man who worked for him.

686
01:20:36,956 --> 01:20:38,261
Why?

687
01:20:39,698 --> 01:20:42,091
To send a message.

688
01:20:44,529 --> 01:20:47,357
Now you hunt them...

689
01:20:47,532 --> 01:20:50,448
so you won't be a message.

690
01:20:51,623 --> 01:20:55,540
I will always be a message.

691
01:20:55,714 --> 01:20:59,239
Only now,
the message is different.

692
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:18,301
Is the border hard to cross?

693
01:21:22,523 --> 01:21:25,091
It could be...

694
01:21:25,265 --> 01:21:27,136
for Isabel Reyes.

695
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:46,634
From now on,
your name is Carina.

696
01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:03,798
Signal was activated at 1939,

697
01:23:03,972 --> 01:23:05,887
heading northeast of Reynosa.

698
01:23:12,024 --> 01:23:14,200
I'm sending another team
to finish this.

699
01:23:14,374 --> 01:23:17,682
No. I'll do it.

700
01:23:17,856 --> 01:23:20,815
'Cause if I don't, he'll
probably come and kill you.

701
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:17,296
Oh...

702
01:28:45,705 --> 01:28:47,905
There's interference on the road.

703
01:28:49,839 --> 01:28:53,191
Are the vehicles unmarked
or police? Unmarked.

704
01:28:56,194 --> 01:28:58,022
ETA to target?

705
01:28:58,196 --> 01:28:59,762
25 minutes.

706
01:30:00,649 --> 01:30:02,173
No.

707
01:30:54,529 --> 01:30:55,529
No?

708
01:32:03,816 --> 01:32:05,034
No.

709
01:33:57,538 --> 01:33:58,626
Huh?

710
01:34:51,113 --> 01:34:52,811
No! No!

711
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:53,985
No! No! No!

712
01:34:59,731 --> 01:35:00,862
No!

713
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,452
That's him. ETA?

714
01:35:25,626 --> 01:35:27,498
15 minutes.

715
01:35:27,672 --> 01:35:30,588
Get us there in ten...
I can't have the girl talk.

716
01:35:30,762 --> 01:35:32,154
Hang on back there.

717
01:35:32,329 --> 01:35:34,113
Gonna get bumpy.

718
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:58,632
José.

719
01:38:50,744 --> 01:38:51,744
No!

720
01:38:53,007 --> 01:38:54,182
No!

721
01:39:54,982 --> 01:39:57,681
Glad we didn't
have to do that.

722
01:39:57,855 --> 01:39:59,683
What about the girl?

723
01:40:02,816 --> 01:40:04,688
Two minutes out.

724
01:40:06,385 --> 01:40:08,039

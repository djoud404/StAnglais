00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,483
- You don't remember me, do you?
- Fuck you! Fuck...

3
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,014
Jose, she's here.

4
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:22,584
Did she find it?

5
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,604
Don't wave.

6
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,350
All right.

7
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:25,372
<i>Mom, hurry up.</i>

8
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,307
Mom!

9
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:33,477
- Riley!
- She's back.

10
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,880
- Riley!
- Just keep going.

11
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:38,049
I know
you can hear me.

12
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,720
Honestly, I don't know
what you were thinking.

13
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:44,788
Sorry, Peg.
I said I was sorry.

14
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,623
This parking lot is
where we set up.

15
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:50,060
Everybody knows that,
from here to the Pottery Barn.

16
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,263
We have earned this spot
because we sell

17
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,898
more Firefly Christmas
baked cookies than anyone.

18
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,469
Maybe if you actually showed up to a Den
Mother meeting, you'd know these...

19
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:00,304
Well, not all of us can sit around
in our perfect little houses

20
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,805
south of the Boulevard,
Peg.

21
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:02,808
Some of us have to work.

22
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:09,313
I will be lodging
a formal grievance

23
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,751
- at the next Den Mother meeting.
- Okay, you do that.

24
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:16,687
I don't think you're
Firefly Troop material.

25
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:17,690
Neither one of you.

26
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,658
Come on, Penelope.

27
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:28,768
What an asshole.

28
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:31,769
- Don't say that.
- Well, she is.

29
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,839
Well, maybe so.
But still...

30
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:36,775
You should've punched
her lights out.

31
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,678
Punched
her lights out, huh?

32
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,781
You can't go around punching
people who are jerks.

33
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:47,351
Then you're just as
bad as they are.

34
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,989
Mom, I know you took
the morning off work.

35
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,192
Thanks, for trying
to help me.

36
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,229
Do you know
how amazing you are?

37
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,899
Happy birthday,
get in the car.

38
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,303
Run, run, run.
Go, go, go.

39
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,871
Listen, I wouldn't ask...

40
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,309
When do you think?

41
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,211
Next month.

42
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:15,647
Right. Yeah, thanks.

43
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,268
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, squirt.

44
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,570
- Oh, how are you?
- Hey.

45
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:41,938
- I'm good.
- Good.

46
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,040
- I should be home by 4:30.
- Okay.

47
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:45,875
Someone's gonna have a birthday party.

48
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:47,709
The other kids
will be there by 4:00.

49
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,347
Can you handle 30
minutes on your own?

50
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,247
How many other kids?

51
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,116
All my friends, Daddy.

52
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:56,953
Chris North, everything in your life
has prepared you for this moment.

53
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,588
Oh, hey, I'm late. Love you.

54
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,754
Love you, bye.

55
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,690
- Love you.
- Bye, guys. Bye!

56
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:03,394
Come here,
birthday girl. Oh!

57
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:08,397
Oh, hi, Mr. Watson.
I'm late. Sorry.

58
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,765
Well, we'll talk about it later. I
gotta do some Christmas shopping.

59
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,102
- Okay.
- And I need you to close today.

60
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,870
- Oh, today is actually...
- Dee Dee called in sick.

61
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:16,405
So you're closing.

62
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,106
- It's my daughter's birthday...
- You asked for extra hours.

63
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,545
I'm giving them to you.
You're closing.

64
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,950
Are you sure, Mickey?
Are you really sure?

65
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,054
- 'Cause, don't put me in a situation...
- I got kids too, man.

66
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,627
Ten minutes, our lives change.
Our kids' lives change.

67
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:40,429
Nobody knows, nobody will know,
all you gotta do is drive.

68
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:41,930
I'll take care
of everything else.

69
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,568
I don't know, Mickey.
I don't know.

70
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:48,770
You wanna get Riley a house, right?
Good school for Carly.

71
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:51,175
This greasy hand shit, it's
not gonna get you there, man.

72
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:52,809
This will.

73
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:06,823
Hi!

74
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,157
I'm here.

75
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,827
Happy birth...

76
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:14,998
Where's everybody?

77
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:19,169
Nobody came.

78
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,971
Nobody came?

79
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:31,680
<i>Riley, Peg.</i>

80
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:33,448
<i>Let's forget
that little snafu</i>

81
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,550
<i>in the parking lot
ever happened.</i>

82
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:37,985
<i>We're having a little
holiday get-together today,</i>

83
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:39,853
<i>Penelope invited
the whole class.</i>

84
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:43,157
<i>I think Carly's invite must
have gotten lost in the mail.</i>

85
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:47,194
<i>Feel free to stop by. If you're
not doing anything else.</i>

86
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:50,398
<i>I'm sure you remember the address.
South of the Boulevard.</i>

87
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,633
<i>Hope to see you guys.</i>

88
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:54,469
Told you.

89
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:56,504
You should've punched
her lights out.

90
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:07,651
You know what,
buddy?

91
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,222
We don't need them
anyway.

92
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,724
It's your birthday.

93
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,191
My birthday sucks!

94
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,693
Carly, language.

95
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:19,829
It does.

96
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,667
We're gonna go out
for pizza.

97
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:29,270
Um, we are, just the three of us.
It'll be fun.

98
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:31,905
And then we're gonna go... we're
gonna go to the Christmas carnival.

99
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:34,108
- Yeah!
- Oh! Yes, the Christmas carnival.

100
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,877
And when we get there,
we are gonna ride every ride,

101
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,546
and play every game.

102
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:42,750
We'll do all the virus and germ infested... Whatever.

103
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,917
But I'm good with that, it's your birthday.

104
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,786
- And then...
- Ice cream?

105
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:48,522
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream. Yes!

106
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,125
Heck, yes. Ice cream, yes,
as much as you want.

107
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:53,893
All right, we're gonna have
a big night. Go get a jacket.

108
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:55,864
- Let's go, go, go.
- Yeah! I'll be ready in a second.

109
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,470
I'm sorry, I just...

110
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:04,640
Hey, honey...

111
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,476
it's not always
gonna be like this.

112
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:09,077
You promise?

113
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,481
Yeah. I promise.

114
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,115
Come here.

115
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,324
<i>This is Mickey. I'm not here
right now, please leave a message.</i>

116
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,762
Mickey, hey, it's Chris.

117
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,297
I'm out.

118
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:30,932
I'm not risking it.

119
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,802
It's not worth it, man.

120
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:37,605
All right, listen, I'm sorry. Uh,
give me a call when you get this.

121
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:41,607
- Where's your dad?
- He's out here.

122
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:42,610
Oh, good.

123
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,179
Carnival! Yay!

124
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:47,182
All right.

125
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,917
Here we go.

126
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:52,921
Carnival.
I'm so excited.

127
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,322
<i>♪ Jingle all the way</i>

128
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,359
<i>♪ Oh what fun
it is to ride... ♪</i>

129
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,596
It's me. Is the boss around?

130
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:04,265
I found the other one.

131
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,869
Seriously,
you trying to rip me off?

132
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:13,475
Did you really think you were
gonna get away with it, Mickey?

133
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,008
Hey, boss, it's for you.

134
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,011
It's Cortez.

135
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,218
I have to take
this phone call.

136
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,521
I hope you don't mind,
Mickey.

137
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:30,523
Talk to me.
What you got?

138
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:32,861
<i>I'm tailing the other guy.
What do you want me to do?</i>

139
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,462
Smoke him.

140
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:36,964
Make an example.

141
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:39,133
A loud one.

142
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:45,305
Mickey,

143
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:48,542
is this what you wanted?

144
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,042
Huh?

145
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:52,881
Is this gonna make
all your problems go away?

146
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,252
Feels good, huh?

147
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,556
Have some folding cash
on you.

148
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:04,859
Right?

149
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,060
Right?

150
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,196
Fucking <i>puto.</i>

151
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,570
Yay! I'm the king!

152
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,245
Give me that one.

153
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:30,250
High five!

154
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:34,786
I kept my eyes open
almost the whole... Oh!

155
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:36,588
Oh, I hope
I look smart.

156
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,725
- Aw. Not so much.
- Look at me.

157
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,793
You're a booger.

158
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:43,262
- Pretty charming.
- Oh, ice cream!

159
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,365
Let's get ice cream.

160
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:59,376
- Come on.
- We're coming, we're coming.

161
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:00,478
Hey,
what'll it be?

162
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,314
Uh, two of your finest
Rocky Roads, and...

163
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:05,115
Yes, and whatever
the little lady...

164
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,617
Peppermint.
Double scoop.

165
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:07,985
And a peppermint
double scoop.

166
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:09,253
- All right.
- It's her birthday.

167
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:10,824
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

168
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,513
- ...with the...
- Yeah, I agree.

169
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:37,481
Goodness,
look at that.

170
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:38,518
Can I try that?

171
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,920
Do you like it?

172
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:44,690
- Birthday, kiddo.
- Bye, sweetie pie.

173
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:52,997
- I'll grab a napkin.
- Okay.

174
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,099
Okay.

175
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,601
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, you got it.

176
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:58,938
- Thank you. Have a good night.
- Bye-bye.

177
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,210
- I know. Every day!
- We're gonna have your birthday every day.

178
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:08,714
Hey, make sure we can
get it in the car.

179
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:57,321
Ready?

180
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:00,591
Three, two...

181
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:05,293
Adult female, 35 years old.
Gunshot wound to the head.

182
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:07,498
Severe cerebral hemorrhaging,
vitals holding.

183
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:09,299
Closing up.

184
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:12,103
We're good.

185
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:16,774
Can I take a look?

186
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,758
It's messed up,
I get it.

187
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,627
But you need to get
your game face on.

188
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,164
We got a job here,
all right?

189
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,636
Shit ain't easy
when it's a kid.

190
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:48,271
It's not
supposed to be easy.

191
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:51,274
That's the difference
between us and them.

192
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:13,394
You were
supposed to call me the moment she woke up.

193
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,563
You don't wake up
from a medically-induced coma

194
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:16,965
like flipping on
a light switch.

195
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:18,532
The gunshot may have
missed her brain,

196
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,367
- but the cerebral swelling...
- But she's gonna be all right?

197
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:27,007
"All right,"
is out of my hands.

198
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,376
When her memory returned
she...

199
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,247
We had to restrain her
and she had to be sedated.

200
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:34,550
Mrs. North.

201
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:38,686
- My name is Detective Stan Carmichael...
- Detective.

202
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:41,324
I've been waiting
to speak to you for a long time.

203
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:47,228
I'm very sorry for your loss.

204
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,232
Forgive me for jumping in so abruptly,
but we have three suspects in custody,

205
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:53,167
who we otherwise will have
to release tomorrow.

206
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:54,935
Detective, this is
really not the time.

207
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:57,440
I... I can talk.

208
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:05,681
We think that what happened
may be linked to your husband.

209
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,682
There were rumors
he was involved

210
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,517
in a plan to rob
a drug dealer

211
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,219
named Diego Garcia.

212
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,921
He wouldn't have to...
He wouldn't do that.

213
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:16,023
No, yes,
you're absolutely right.

214
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,125
We recovered a voicemail
on his friend's telephone,

215
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:20,263
your husband did refuse
to go along with it, but,

216
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,595
word had already gotten out.

217
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:24,767
And got back to Garcia.

218
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:29,602
Now, an informant has given
us a very credible lead,

219
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:32,139
but no witnesses
are willing to step up.

220
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:34,543
We know everything,
but can't prove anything.

221
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,047
Detective.

222
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,250
I think that's enough now.

223
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,388
You get some rest,
Mrs. North, I'll come back.

224
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,158
But I, uh...

225
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,594
thought you might
wanna have this.

226
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:24,593
I saw them.

227
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,328
<i>All right, bring 'em out.</i>

228
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,463
Let's go.
Get in there.

229
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,547
Um...

230
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:48,816
It's number five.

231
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,652
Number five,
step forward.

232
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:57,359
Take 'em out.
Next group.

233
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:09,036
Number three.

234
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:11,805
Number three,
step forward.

235
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,511
That's him.

236
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,551
Four.

237
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:30,324
Hmm.

238
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:34,228
Are you sure?

239
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,569
Yes, I'm sure.

240
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,377
Hey, thanks.

241
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,221
What's the matter,
you not hungry?

242
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,060
Tell me what that is.

243
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:10,761
That would be
a detective badge.

244
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:14,534
That would be all they found on the
last cop who went after Diego Garcia.

245
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,438
It was in his locker,
hanging in his locker here,

246
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,076
inside
Metro Homicide Headquarters.

247
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,112
Garcia has people
on the inside?

248
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:32,116
Garcia has a nickname,
<i>La Guillotine.</i>

249
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,920
There's a reason
for that shit, Stan.

250
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,289
Chris North didn't even
rob Garcia.

251
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:43,395
He just considered it, and he's on the
wrong side of the grass with his kid.

252
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:46,465
Whatever happens with
this case, let it happen.

253
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,932
Don't be stupid.

254
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,136
You'll only get dead
and it won't change anything.

255
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:40,886
Hello?

256
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,791
- Oh, Mrs. North.
- Who are you?

257
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,327
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

258
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,299
Um, I'm...
I'm a friend.

259
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,867
Uh, do you
wanna have a seat?

260
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:57,569
What do you want?

261
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,871
Eviction notice.

262
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,009
I can only imagine how
awful all of this has been for you.

263
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,711
I mean, how does one even begin to
recover from something like that?

264
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,181
Why are you here?

265
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,186
I just, uh... I just wanna
give you a bit of advice.

266
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:22,158
The road to recovery
has to begin somewhere.

267
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,433
The recognition that um...
as gut-wrenching as it is,

268
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:34,840
in the end, nothing's gonna
bring your family back.

269
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:41,246
I know, and that's the regrettable,
yet unavoidable truth.

270
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,683
Eventually, maybe
not right away,

271
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:50,455
but eventually it'll be
time for you to move on.

272
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:55,360
New place, new clothes,
new memories.

273
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:03,901
A new life.

274
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,211
What is this?

275
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,385
Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone?
That's an antipsychotic.

276
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:24,388
Hey!

277
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,559
I think it's time
for you to leave.

278
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,493
Maybe you've made
a mistake.

279
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:33,795
Your memory is
a little hazy.

280
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:35,397
I'm just
putting it out there.

281
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,499
Maybe you didn't see things

282
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:38,769
the way you thought
you saw them.

283
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,137
Hmm?

284
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:44,008
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!

285
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:46,010
Get out!

286
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,314
You think that
you're gonna have justice?

287
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,317
Make them all pay?

288
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:56,852
They won't.

289
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:57,988
Get the fuck out!

290
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:15,103
Is there anything else you would
like to ask the witness, Mr. Henderson?

291
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,938
One last question,
Your Honor.

292
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,441
Mrs. North,
just to clarify one point.

293
00:26:19,443 --> 00:26:20,977
Did you see them
get out of the car?

294
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:23,146
- No.
- Hmm.

295
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:25,982
Did the car ever stop moving?

296
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:29,050
No.

297
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:32,222
And yet you identified my clients
as the alleged shooters?

298
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,691
- They did it.
- Objection, Your Honor.

299
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:36,857
Calls for legal conclusion.

300
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,859
Sustained.

301
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:41,028
- Mrs. North, we're interested in facts. Not opinions.
- He just asked me a question

302
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,230
- and I just answered.
- It's okay.

303
00:26:42,232 --> 00:26:45,132
You identified
my clients, correct?

304
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:47,368
- Yes, I did. They did it...
- Okay. Okay.

305
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,242
And are you currently on any
antipsychotic medications?

306
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,076
What?

307
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,578
- Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone?
- Wait.

308
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,347
- Is there anything else we should know about?
- But that's not...

309
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:01,816
- Wait, that's not accurate.
- You identified not one, but three men

310
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:04,552
in a moving vehicle
at night from 30 feet.

311
00:27:04,554 --> 00:27:06,053
- After a month in a coma...
- I saw them.

312
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:07,855
- and a mental breakdown...
- It's not something you forget.

313
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,991
And under the influence of antidepressant
and antipsychotic medications.

314
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:11,692
Excuse me,
he's not listening to me!

315
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:14,530
Is it possible that your recollection
isn't what you thought it was?

316
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,667
No.

317
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:23,504
No further questions,
Your Honor.

318
00:27:23,506 --> 00:27:25,673
Wait, but you're not hearing me.
Can you help me out?

319
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:28,175
You're the district attorney.
Can't you do anything?

320
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:29,909
I didn't even
take those pills...

321
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:32,613
It is the opinion of this court
that in this preliminary hearing,

322
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,448
the evidence is insufficient

323
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,883
for a juror
to reasonably conclude

324
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:40,086
that the State has met
its burden of proof.

325
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:43,426
I see no reason to hold
the defendants over for trial.

326
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:57,237
Wait a minute.
This can't be over.

327
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:00,040
- These men killed my family.
- Mrs. North, you're excused.

328
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:01,609
No, they killed my family!

329
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:03,611
- This guy showed up in my house.
- You are excused, Mrs. North.

330
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:05,312
No, I am not finished!

331
00:28:05,314 --> 00:28:07,447
- You are excused, Mrs... Mrs. North.
- He offered me money!

332
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:09,949
- No, no, no! I am not done!
- Mrs. North, you're excused!

333
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:12,254
- They are killers! They're fucking killers!
- Mrs. North. Bailiffs!

334
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:17,390
Get away from me!
I'm gonna kill them.

335
00:28:30,172 --> 00:28:31,773
Bailiffs,
remove this woman.

336
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:37,412
Mrs. North, I'm remanding you to a
mental health treatment program.

337
00:28:38,347 --> 00:28:39,479
Next case.

338
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:52,192
Why is she bleeding?
What happened?

339
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:54,329
She wouldn't stop banging
her head into the bars.

340
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:00,132
- She's all yours now.
- All right.

341
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:02,968
Mrs. North? Riley,
it's Detective Stan Carmichael.

342
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,036
Do you hear me?

343
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:05,871
Hey, guys,
come on, come on.

344
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:07,873
She saw her family get murdered and
the guys who did it just walked.

345
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,143
How about you lighten up?

346
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,515
Clear?
One, two, three.

347
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,187
- Where is she going?
- County General, psych hold.

348
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:22,689
That place is a nightmare.

349
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:25,692
County General, psych hold.

350
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,328
That place is a nightmare.

351
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,132
Hang on. Let me make a call.

352
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:37,405
Hey!

353
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,342
- You all right?
- Yeah.

354
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:44,378
Sorry.

355
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:15,743
Well, you called it.

356
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:21,780
She'll turn up.

357
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:23,584
One way or another,
they always do.

358
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:50,076
Carmichael, 3-8-7-7,
Gang Homicide.

359
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:06,757
Don't you look especially
pretty this morning.

360
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,426
Thanks for showing up.

361
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:10,396
I've always been a firm
believer in beauty sleep.

362
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,600
Pro tip.

363
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:17,604
Wait until you're dead
before you embalm yourself.

364
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:23,610
Well,

365
00:31:24,944 --> 00:31:26,078
that's new.

366
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,778
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
jingle all the way ♪</i>

367
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,149
<i>♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ♪</i>

368
00:32:05,852 --> 00:32:08,220
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way... ♪</i>

369
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,689
- Good morning, Lisa. You got a minute?
- What?

370
00:32:12,691 --> 00:32:14,658
Somebody drove a truck
into a gun store

371
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,861
out in San Bernardino
a couple of nights ago.

372
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,829
The place was
a class-three dealer

373
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:20,330
and military-grade stuff.

374
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:23,199
ATF called us after reviewing
the security footage.

375
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:26,403
Uh, it was a woman. They got a
partial frame of the suspect's face.

376
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,672
Give it to
the DHS Fusion Center.

377
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:31,008
Let them run it through
their facial recognition system.

378
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,476
I did. Got a possible match
from customs

379
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,712
on a stowaway incident,
container ship,

380
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:38,315
at the Port of LA
three months ago.

381
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:40,719
Uh, your name popped up
on the case file, so I...

382
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:47,359
Inman.

383
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,529
Inman.

384
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,409
Are you maybe thinking
what I'm thinking?

385
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:13,284
Carmichael.

386
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:16,454
Who?

387
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:19,057
Yeah, sure.

388
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:22,191
The FBI wants to talk to us.

389
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:23,227
Feds?

390
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:50,179
Did you guys
run out of terrorists?

391
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:52,780
How come the feds care about
a squirrelly soccer mom?

392
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:54,549
Didn't she smack you in
the head five years ago?

393
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,952
Smacking dumbasses
ain't a federal offense.

394
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:58,020
Ha-ha.

395
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:00,055
Bank robbery is.

396
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,656
The night Riley North
got away from you,

397
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:04,625
she stole $55,000 from the
bank where she was employed.

398
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:07,995
Are we talking about the same Riley North?
Bank robbery?

399
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:11,566
Mm-hmm. She just disappeared,
completely off the grid,

400
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,735
as if she just ceased to be.

401
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,803
You're shitting me.
She wasn't the type.

402
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,371
I agree.

403
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:20,408
A woman with no priors, even if
her family is brutally murdered

404
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,746
doesn't just up and take
50 large and then take off.

405
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:24,714
Got my attention.

406
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:33,255
How many times did you
betray your oath, Your Honor?

407
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:39,193
I think that you're so goddamn
corrupt, I don't even stand out.

408
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:42,264
Well...

409
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,001
So, here's the deal.

410
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:50,173
If you can tell me my name,
I'll let you live.

411
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,941
I mean, you'll eat out of a
tube the rest of your life,

412
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,276
but you'll live.

413
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,279
You ready?

414
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:03,887
Do you remember my name?

415
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,691
Interpol tagged her
four months later.

416
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:14,594
Used her real name in a
hospital in Hong Kong.

417
00:36:14,596 --> 00:36:17,031
Showed up with
a dislocated shoulder,

418
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,233
facial fracture,
ruptured spleen.

419
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:21,068
- Car wreck?
- Don't know.

420
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,969
She left before we could
have her apprehended.

421
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:24,404
She vanished.

422
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:26,473
Every now and then, a lead
trickles in from somewhere.

423
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,143
Some we can almost
substantiate, some we can't.

424
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,246
She's a shit magnet. Why
are you wasting our time?

425
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:33,448
Then we found this
on YouTube.

426
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,058
Wait, that's...
that's Riley North?

427
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,927
Herself,
in Europe last year,

428
00:36:46,929 --> 00:36:49,596
under one of the four identities
we've tracked so far.

429
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,765
She got really, really good
at staying off the radar.

430
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,801
So she spends the last five years
bouncing around the world,

431
00:36:54,803 --> 00:36:58,505
learning how to
get into trouble. And?

432
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,240
We don't exactly know
what she was doing.

433
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:01,942
What we do know,
is that she arrived in L.A.

434
00:37:01,944 --> 00:37:03,145
three months ago.

435
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:08,815
Security cameras got this during a
gun shop burglary a few days ago.

436
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:10,851
She only took military grade.

437
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,988
Automatic rifles, high-capacity
shotguns, specific ammunition.

438
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,259
She knew exactly
what she was looking for.

439
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:19,793
She's back.

440
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:22,695
And today, you found the three guys
that allegedly killed her family.

441
00:37:22,697 --> 00:37:24,833
Strung up, execution style.

442
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:28,869
Do you know what
the date is today?

443
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,536
- Come again?
- The date.

444
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:31,704
What's today's date?

445
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:33,108
It's December 21st.

446
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:36,477
Five-year anniversary
of her family's murder.

447
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:46,485
This stuff wrapped around you
is det cord, explosive rope.

448
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:48,053
You can cut through anything
with this.

449
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:51,058
Cut through trees,
cut through concrete...

450
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:53,027
Corrupt judges.

451
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:10,711
Watching someone
take everything from you.

452
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:14,482
All you have,

453
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,318
all you're ever gonna have,

454
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,321
just gone.

455
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:23,024
Hurts, doesn't it?

456
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,694
And knowing that it's all over,

457
00:38:28,696 --> 00:38:31,165
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

458
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,737
You didn't serve justice,
Your Honor. I will.

459
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:26,953
Carmichael. Hm-hmm.

460
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:29,322
What?

461
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:31,758
Okay.

462
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:33,960
Thanks.

463
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:37,161
Steven Goldman
and Robert Henderson,

464
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:38,796
the DA and attorney
at that hearing,

465
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:40,999
- five years ago?
- Yeah.

466
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:43,001
Goldman was found face down
in his swimming pool

467
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:45,103
and Henderson's house
burned down with him in it,

468
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:46,505
last night, both of them.

469
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,007
And that's not all.

470
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:50,775
LAPD bomb squad
is currently onsite

471
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:52,676
at the residence
of one James Stevens,

472
00:39:52,678 --> 00:39:55,446
criminal court judge,
recently retired.

473
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:58,282
Some sort of explosion
at his house.

474
00:39:58,284 --> 00:40:00,519
There's barely enough left of
him to fill an evidence bag.

475
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:04,088
Don't think I need
to tell you who he was.

476
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,260
We gotta go wide with this.
APB, the media, the whole deal.

477
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:25,644
That looks good. Stack it up.

478
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:40,957
We need
to talk to you.

479
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,395
- We have a problem.
- What?

480
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:47,733
Just a minute.

481
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:51,136
Our informant called.

482
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,004
She got a judge
and, uh...

483
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:55,672
And a lawyer
we paid off.

484
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:57,474
Smoked some of
our homies, too.

485
00:40:57,476 --> 00:40:59,078
The ones we sent
to take out her husband.

486
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:01,344
When the fuck was this?

487
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:03,080
Like, five years ago.

488
00:41:03,082 --> 00:41:04,083
Is there
a problem?

489
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,418
No, just uh...

490
00:41:08,387 --> 00:41:10,253
Go and get Jessica
out of the car,

491
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:11,890
bring her in
with a couple of drinks.

492
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:14,326
And that thing?

493
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:19,429
Put a paycheck
on her head,

494
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:20,499
call it a day.

495
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:29,705
Some personnel stuff.

496
00:41:29,707 --> 00:41:30,875
You know how it goes.

497
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:32,908
Got ten more tons...

498
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,777
Your bullshit
ain't why I'm here.

499
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:37,082
You know, you shouldn't
play games with the cartel.

500
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:41,286
I came to deliver a message
from my father.

501
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,129
It's just a misunderstanding.

502
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:54,699
One shipment goes missing,

503
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,101
maybe it's a mistake.

504
00:41:57,802 --> 00:41:58,970
But two?

505
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:01,871
In a week?

506
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:03,739
You think I tried
to steal from you?

507
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:05,611
That I lasted this long
by being stupid?

508
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:10,580
Everybody wants to be
a big dog.

509
00:42:10,582 --> 00:42:12,748
Little dogs
trying to eat my food.

510
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,784
That's all it is.

511
00:42:16,888 --> 00:42:17,889
Hey, baby.

512
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,340
Get the fuck outta here.

513
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:43,581
There's something
you need to remember.

514
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,421
You are still
a little dog.

515
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:54,758
Don't let our business
be interfered with again.

516
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:33,863
Who's that for?

517
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:36,866
It's for you.

518
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,202
Thanks.

519
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:43,473
Is he okay?

520
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:46,541
He drinks.

521
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:50,044
I have to take care
of him sometimes.

522
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:52,082
<i>Stop requested.

523
00:43:58,255 --> 00:43:59,755
Dad. Come on.

524
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:02,726
Bye.

525
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:05,861
I told you
not to speak to strangers.

526
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:08,862
Hey.

527
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:10,333
Where'd you get
that shitty toy?

528
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:14,036
Sit. Sit.

529
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:24,612
Give me your wallet.

530
00:44:24,614 --> 00:44:25,615
Oh, okay.

531
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,715
Okay.

532
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:29,251
I'm gonna need you
to stand still, please.

533
00:44:33,956 --> 00:44:36,290
All right.
What do we have here?

534
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:38,360
Bryan Hartley,
1214 Harlow Street.

535
00:44:39,696 --> 00:44:40,896
Open your mouth, Bryan.

536
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:46,233
This is one of those
life-altering moments.

537
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:47,868
Do I have your attention?

538
00:44:49,706 --> 00:44:51,438
I want you to take your boy
Christmas shopping.

539
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,608
I want you to give him
the time of his life.

540
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,545
I want you to grow up and
be the father he deserves.

541
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:58,645
Do you understand me?

542
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:00,280
I understand.

543
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:01,915
- Say it again.
- I understand.

544
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:03,617
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

545
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,252
1214 Harlow.

546
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:06,822
I will never forget you,
Bryan.

547
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:08,490
Are we clear?

548
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:11,425
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

549
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:12,461
What are you still
doing here?

550
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,299
Come on.

551
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:22,269
You ever sell him anything else and I
will blow you and this place to bits.

552
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:23,670
- Do you understand?
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:25,138
- Do you have a car?
- Yeah.

554
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,141
Give me the keys.

555
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:29,010
Consider it a rental.

556
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,371
Hey.

557
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,873
You're in the wrong place.

558
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,341
Oh, actually I'm not.

559
00:46:35,343 --> 00:46:36,477
Get the fuck out of here.

560
00:47:09,544 --> 00:47:11,677
- What's up, man?
- What's going on?

561
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,614
Listen, I'm about to get
this money, homes.

562
00:47:35,235 --> 00:47:37,702
<i>...in this normally
quiet upscale neighborhood.</i>

563
00:47:37,704 --> 00:47:39,404
<i>Maureen, can you tell us more?</i>

564
00:47:39,406 --> 00:47:41,539
<i>What do we know about
the suspected bomber?</i>

565
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:44,576
<i>North is suspected to
have been behind today's bombing</i>

566
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:47,545
<i>and of possibly killing
up to five others.</i>

567
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:51,115
<i>Authorities believe her to be
armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

568
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:54,921
<i>If you see her, please contact the
police at the number on the screen.</i>

569
00:48:14,774 --> 00:48:17,007
<i>...so called
"sweet killer."</i>

570
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:19,644
<i>What could be expected
for her next move?</i>

571
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,114
<i>What will the law enforcement
agencies respond with?</i>

572
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:30,757
What the fuck?

573
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:36,794
Come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

574
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:37,797
Come on!

575
00:48:45,437 --> 00:48:46,971
Oh, shit.

576
00:50:34,646 --> 00:50:35,947
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

577
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:38,648
I have questions for you.

578
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,751
You're not busy, are you?

579
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,119
No.

580
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:45,054
<i>A fire has partially
destroyed this downtown pinata store,</i>

581
00:50:45,056 --> 00:50:48,124
Crazy.
Crazy, crazy.

582
00:50:48,126 --> 00:50:51,127
She's fucking crazy, man.

583
00:50:51,129 --> 00:50:53,329
You already said that,
Marvin.

584
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:54,997
Yeah, well,
I'm saying it again.

585
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:57,066
So, you decided
to tell her everything.

586
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:59,402
The whole damn operation.

587
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:03,139
Yeah, but you guys would have
done the same thing. It's...

588
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:05,677
I'm so impressed by how
fucking stupid you are.

589
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:08,176
How much
did she take?

590
00:51:08,178 --> 00:51:11,181
She... Well, she
didn't take anything. She...

591
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,451
She burned all the money.

592
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:23,159
It's the last fucking shit
that I need right now.

593
00:51:23,161 --> 00:51:24,794
Boss, I'm so sorry.

594
00:51:24,796 --> 00:51:26,194
You know that
I would never...

595
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:27,529
It's just these were
some extenuating...

596
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:28,833
Shut the fuck up!

597
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,537
Trust me, we will
have a short...

598
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:38,142
a very short conversation
about this in a minute.

599
00:51:42,512 --> 00:51:44,312
Double security.

600
00:51:44,314 --> 00:51:46,650
Put that bitch
in a box before sunset.

601
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:49,786
Before she
gets us all killed.

602
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:52,954
<i>Thank you, Joanna.</i>

603
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:54,556
<i>Today, Los Angeles
has witnessed</i>

604
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:56,791
<i>a disturbing series
of violent events</i>

605
00:51:56,793 --> 00:51:59,861
<i>which some are speculating
are part of a pattern,</i>

606
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:02,731
<i>possibly even the work
of a single suspect.</i>

607
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:05,500
<i>According to sources at the
Los Angeles Police Department,</i>

608
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:08,002
<i>everything seems to lead
to the same name,</i>

609
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:09,304
<i>Riley North.</i>

610
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,973
<i>So, who is Riley North?</i>

611
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:14,576
<i>Looking to social media,
theories abound.</i>

612
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:15,977
<i>One possible link,</i>

613
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:17,545
<i>Riley North's husband
and daughter</i>

614
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:20,582
<i>were gunned down in a drive-by
shooting, five years ago.</i>

615
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:24,753
<i>There is a storm of online
speculation about a connection.</i>

616
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:27,889
Folks, I'm gonna need
you behind the tape, thank you.

617
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:29,758
Thirty-four, Asian, male.

618
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,259
- Yeah, yo. Check it out.
- Roughly...

619
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:36,097
Well, I got a dozen witnesses who
suddenly went blind and didn't see shit.

620
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:38,032
So we got that
going for us.

621
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:40,434
What the hell are the Koreans
doing, slumming it with Garcia?

622
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:42,003
Money laundering.

623
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:44,371
Garcia's using their infrastructure
to launder his cash.

624
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:46,040
These fuckers ain't
gonna be happy.

625
00:52:46,042 --> 00:52:48,344
It's gonna get a whole lot worse
if we don't get ahead of this.

626
00:52:51,614 --> 00:52:53,680
We got every black
and white in this city looking,

627
00:52:53,682 --> 00:52:56,050
every camera. Her face
is all over the news.

628
00:52:56,052 --> 00:52:57,851
Well, she knows
what she's doing.

629
00:52:57,853 --> 00:53:00,854
It's turning into a typical
social media shit storm.

630
00:53:00,856 --> 00:53:02,591
Garcia's gonna love
all this attention.

631
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,461
Hey, man.

632
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:10,733
There's, uh, something I
want you to take a look at.

633
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:12,269
Over here.

634
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:15,205
Stand back, thank you.

635
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,073
Well, this is
a hard sell.

636
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:22,376
You honestly think that
Riley North did this?

637
00:53:22,378 --> 00:53:24,279
Well, your Fed girlfriend
thinks so.

638
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:26,980
- My what?
- Stan, my man,

639
00:53:26,982 --> 00:53:29,950
you gotta focus on the task at hand.
It's embarrassing.

640
00:53:29,952 --> 00:53:32,419
The only interest I have in
Agent Inman is professional.

641
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:34,154
- If you say so.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

642
00:53:34,156 --> 00:53:36,723
All right, I'll hit up Gang Narcotics
and see if they have any intel

643
00:53:36,725 --> 00:53:38,425
on suspected
Garcia locations.

644
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:40,393
Get a list,
set up some Code 5s,

645
00:53:40,395 --> 00:53:41,931
do surveillance
and see if she shows.

646
00:53:43,899 --> 00:53:46,266
You be careful who you ask
those kind of questions to.

647
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,902
- Fuck's sake. Here we go again.
- Oh, hey.

648
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:52,005
It only takes a few guys
in the right places.

649
00:53:52,007 --> 00:53:53,575
Watch your ass
is all I'm saying.

650
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:56,409
And you say hi
to Bigfoot for me.

651
00:53:56,411 --> 00:53:57,978
What, lover's quarrel?

652
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,080
What about Bigfoot?

653
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:04,151
Yeah, we were debating who gets to
be impressed by your FBI prowess.

654
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:05,154
I won.

655
00:54:06,255 --> 00:54:08,255
So what are you thinking?

656
00:54:08,257 --> 00:54:10,823
Riley North arrived in LA
almost three months ago.

657
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:12,594
Aren't you guys a little curious
where she's been hanging out?

658
00:54:14,096 --> 00:54:15,496
You have a crime analysis
department, right?

659
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:18,600
Yeah, come with me,
I'll take you there.

660
00:54:41,022 --> 00:54:43,825
Cartel up our ass.
And now the Korean Mob?

661
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:45,994
What's she gonna hit next?

662
00:54:48,162 --> 00:54:50,563
Bet Marvin told her
about the lab.

663
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:52,465
- That would be my bet.
- Fine.

664
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:55,003
Then we send everybody there and
just kill her when she shows up.

665
00:55:03,044 --> 00:55:04,045
Boss.

666
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,084
How'd she know
about Marvin?

667
00:55:14,155 --> 00:55:16,090
The one guy who happened
to know everything.

668
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,361
And she doesn't kill him.

669
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:23,064
How did she know?

670
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:26,498
She must have been watching us.

671
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,565
Oh, you think?

672
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,939
Those missing shipments,
it was her.

673
00:55:32,073 --> 00:55:33,740
She's been stirring shit up,

674
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:37,109
finding out the moving pieces.

675
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:39,347
Bitch has been
fucking with us for weeks.

676
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:42,248
If that's the case,

677
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,184
then maybe she's expecting us
to send everybody to the lab.

678
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:47,420
That dance is over.

679
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:49,854
Bitch wanna have
the motherfucking lab,

680
00:55:49,856 --> 00:55:51,458
I will give her
the motherfucking lab.

681
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,784
The system tracks reported
crime in real time.

682
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,853
From that data, we determine
where to send our resources.

683
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:57,190
Stop problems from spreading.

684
00:56:57,757 --> 00:56:58,989
Any anomalies?

685
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:01,259
Areas of higher violent crime
than expected?

686
00:57:01,261 --> 00:57:02,793
Besides tonight?

687
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,662
Going back a few weeks, are
there any areas that stand out?

688
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:07,865
This can't predict
where she'll turn up next.

689
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:09,700
It might tell me
where she's been.

690
00:57:09,702 --> 00:57:12,203
Everywhere she goes, people get dead.
She has to be living somewhere.

691
00:57:12,205 --> 00:57:14,171
Maybe I can locate
where she's been staying,

692
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:15,841
her base of operations.
Find her that way.

693
00:57:26,386 --> 00:57:28,018
Nothing.

694
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,988
No sector or neighborhood
stands out.

695
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,159
No abnormal spike
in crimes anywhere.

696
00:57:35,361 --> 00:57:37,029
It was a good idea.
I was impressed.

697
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,496
Really.

698
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,298
Oh, you wanna see something
really interesting?

699
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,969
I was looking at this
before you got here.

700
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:48,705
Social media is lit up
with support for her.

701
00:57:48,707 --> 00:57:50,841
She's a multiple
homicide suspect.

702
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,976
Well, not to them she's not.

703
00:57:52,978 --> 00:57:55,214
Now that people know what she's been
through, they're rooting for her.

704
00:57:55,748 --> 00:57:56,748
Look.

705
00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:02,086
Zoom in.
There. What's that?

706
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:03,719
Skid Row?

707
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:05,522
Why does it look
safer than Bel-Air?

708
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,824
Hmm. That's odd.

709
00:58:07,826 --> 00:58:09,692
Has it
always been like that?

710
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,762
You keep the data,
right?

711
00:58:12,664 --> 00:58:13,765
Can you
give me a minute?

712
00:58:59,612 --> 00:59:01,077
What's going on?

713
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,080
You see anything?

714
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,116
I don't see nothing.

715
00:59:21,232 --> 00:59:22,833
<i>She's in.
Hit the remote.</i>

716
00:59:49,661 --> 00:59:51,193
Uh... Okay,

717
00:59:51,195 --> 00:59:54,131
so the crime pattern started
changing about three months ago.

718
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:58,436
Oh, shit. What's that?

719
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:04,105
Multiple reports
of an explosion.

720
01:00:04,107 --> 01:00:06,442
Fire. Industrial warehouse,
downtown...

721
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:08,511
You stay here.
I'll catch up with you.

722
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:10,646
- Catch up? Where are you going?
- I got a hunch.

723
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,814
But we didn't talk about
a hunch.

724
01:00:12,816 --> 01:00:15,951
What?

725
01:00:15,953 --> 01:00:17,385
Radios are lighting up.

726
01:00:17,387 --> 01:00:19,689
- <i>What happened?</i>
- Downtown warehouse just exploded.

727
01:00:19,691 --> 01:00:20,789
<i>Is it her again?</i>

728
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,390
I'll check it out.

729
01:00:22,392 --> 01:00:24,559
Was it on the list of Garcia
locations you got from Narco?

730
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,127
- I don't know.
- <i>What the heck does that mean?</i>

731
01:00:26,129 --> 01:00:27,395
<i>Did you get a list or not?</i>

732
01:00:27,397 --> 01:00:30,065
It... I haven't heard back
from them yet, okay?

733
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:31,900
But I'm on it.

734
01:00:31,902 --> 01:00:34,536
They're probably just busy,
there's a lot going on right now.

735
01:00:34,538 --> 01:00:37,239
Yeah, right. By the way,
Bigfoot says hi.

736
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,041
Oh, come on, Moises, it doesn't
mean anything. They're just...

737
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,701
Hey, are you okay?

738
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:07,067
Hi.

739
01:01:07,069 --> 01:01:08,270
Hey!
Hey, what the...

740
01:01:08,272 --> 01:01:10,871
Hey! Hey!
Get out of my car!

741
01:01:10,873 --> 01:01:12,507
Wait, come on!

742
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:13,708
Give me my car back!

743
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:49,078
It's them.

744
01:01:49,645 --> 01:01:50,646
They got her.

745
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:57,318
What's the word?

746
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,320
Hey, boss,
we smoked her ass.

747
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:00,721
<i>Are you sure?</i>

748
01:02:00,723 --> 01:02:02,423
She was up in there
when it went up.

749
01:02:02,425 --> 01:02:04,291
There's no way she's
living through that shit.

750
01:02:04,293 --> 01:02:05,394
Trust me, she's gone.

751
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,303
You fools are moving up
in the world.

752
01:02:16,305 --> 01:02:17,773
<i>Be calling some shots
pretty soon.</i>

753
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:19,606
Thank you, boss.

754
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:20,909
<i>Now get your ass back here.</i>

755
01:02:30,118 --> 01:02:31,420
We'll be calling
some shots!

756
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,188
Whoo!

757
01:02:51,973 --> 01:02:52,974
Mm.

758
01:03:01,216 --> 01:03:02,217
That's a cop.

759
01:03:03,118 --> 01:03:04,517
How do you know?

760
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,488
Who else would be dumb enough
to bring a new car here?

761
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:15,363
Hi.

762
01:03:17,165 --> 01:03:18,566
Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

763
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:23,471
You lost?

764
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,242
I'm looking for someone.

765
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:30,976
Looking for someone.

766
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:32,913
No one's
looking for nobodies.

767
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:36,016
Isn't it dangerous
at night for the kids?

768
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,685
Not anymore.

769
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:40,688
Why's that?

770
01:03:42,524 --> 01:03:43,924
'Cause we got an angel now.

771
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:17,890
Is that car following us?

772
01:04:17,892 --> 01:04:19,357
What are you talking about?

773
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:26,598
I told you to lay off
that shit, man.

774
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,135
- You're getting paranoid.
- Shut the fuck up.

775
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:32,905
Shit.

776
01:04:32,907 --> 01:04:34,439
What the fuck's up
with that guy?

777
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:35,442
Oh, no.

778
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:00,233
Ah, yeah.

779
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:05,236
Boss,
check it out.

780
01:05:05,238 --> 01:05:08,239
<i>What makes you think
Riley North did this too?</i>

781
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:11,342
<i>'Cause I saw her jack this
dude's car and just take off.</i>

782
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:12,646
<i>And she was pissed.</i>

783
01:05:14,113 --> 01:05:17,181
<i>Social media continues
to explode with debate</i>

784
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:21,020
<i>about female vigilante, Riley
North, still on the loose.</i>

785
01:05:33,834 --> 01:05:35,134
It's them. Open it.

786
01:06:32,925 --> 01:06:33,926
Kill the lights.

787
01:06:35,061 --> 01:06:36,062
Stay with the boss.

788
01:07:38,657 --> 01:07:41,758
Don't, please. Please, don't.

789
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,327
I'm not here
to hurt you. Shh.

790
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:51,770
- He...
- Go.

791
01:08:49,226 --> 01:08:50,226
Fuck.

792
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:02,072
Don't fucking move!

793
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:07,509
Who the fuck are you?

794
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:08,545
What do you want?

795
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:10,180
What do I want?

796
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,483
I want justice.

797
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:15,085
Papa?

798
01:09:24,728 --> 01:09:26,262
Come here, baby.
Let's go!

799
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:30,834
Boss?

800
01:09:37,908 --> 01:09:38,909
Boss?

801
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,776
Boss?

802
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:44,079
Where is she? Where is she?

803
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:47,515
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It's okay.

804
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,383
<i>Jefe,</i> we gotta go.
We gotta go now!

805
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:50,451
We gotta go now!

806
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,470
Riley?

807
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,742
Good evening, Peg.

808
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:35,688
I remembered the address.

809
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,191
Sorry, we missed
the party last time.

810
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:41,127
Riley,
you're fucking crazy.

811
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:43,298
Everything they said
about you is true.

812
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:47,168
You know,

813
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:49,969
I couldn't help but notice,

814
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:53,074
you're not wearing a ring
on that finger anymore.

815
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:56,510
He left you, didn't he?

816
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,179
For someone younger,
prettier.

817
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,750
Go fuck yourself.

818
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:06,687
Oops.

819
01:12:08,823 --> 01:12:09,858
Yes, he...

820
01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:12,826
He left, okay?
You're right, I...

821
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:15,161
Please.

822
01:12:15,163 --> 01:12:17,363
This is... This is
not gonna bring her back.

823
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,332
I... I'm very sorry
that Carly and...

824
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:20,666
Don't say my daughter's name.

825
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:22,337
Okay.
I won't. I...

826
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,838
You're gonna get
locked away.

827
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,707
You're gonna go to jail
for a very long time.

828
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:30,410
They...
They will catch you.

829
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:33,013
This is not... You don't
wanna be doing this.

830
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,951
- Thank you.
- I'm going to

831
01:12:38,953 --> 01:12:41,088
burn your house down now,
Peg,

832
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:43,358
with you inside of it.

833
01:12:44,124 --> 01:12:45,225
Oh, good.

834
01:12:46,026 --> 01:12:47,393
Riley.

835
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:49,528
Riley! Get back here, Riley!

836
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,730
- No!
- Stop squealing, Peg.

837
01:12:51,732 --> 01:12:53,298
- I'm just kidding.
- Riley!

838
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,566
No!

839
01:12:54,568 --> 01:12:55,569
No!

840
01:12:55,903 --> 01:12:57,035
Riley!

841
01:13:16,256 --> 01:13:17,488
Moises.

842
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:19,159
- Got that info you wanted.
- Shoot.

843
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:24,963
All right, this place is owned by
an overseas company out of Belize.

844
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:26,331
So, any number
of assholes can be...

845
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:27,765
This is Diego Garcia's house.

846
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:28,967
Hey, I'm just saying.

847
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:30,402
Hey, you seen Carmichael
anywhere?

848
01:13:30,404 --> 01:13:32,437
I can't get him
on the phone.

849
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:33,806
Ain't my turn
to watch that baby.

850
01:13:35,508 --> 01:13:37,109
Hey, asshole.

851
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:38,477
If you see him,
tell him to call me.

852
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,445
- Getting a little worried about him.
- Roger that.

853
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:41,482
Hey, Barker.

854
01:13:41,948 --> 01:13:43,315
Barker.

855
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:45,250
What the fuck's going on
in Narcotics?

856
01:13:45,252 --> 01:13:47,486
Carmichael's been trying to get
a list of Garcia locations

857
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:49,287
from you guys
and he gets blown off?

858
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:51,490
You got somebody trying to
protect that motherfucker?

859
01:13:51,492 --> 01:13:53,425
- Hold on, Moises...
- No, no. Don't "Moises" me.

860
01:13:53,427 --> 01:13:55,695
I've been trying to call
Carmichael all goddamn night.

861
01:13:57,364 --> 01:13:58,662
- What?
- Yeah.

862
01:13:58,664 --> 01:14:00,631
Calls, texts, emails.

863
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:02,666
Even went by his desk twice.

864
01:14:02,668 --> 01:14:05,770
We've been trying to coordinate
with him since this thing started.

865
01:14:05,772 --> 01:14:07,173
Who told you
we didn't call him back?

866
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,511
He did.

867
01:14:24,657 --> 01:14:26,457
I think
there's another cop.

868
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:28,959
Where's your backup?
What took you so long?

869
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:30,961
Sorry, they're
a little behind.

870
01:14:30,963 --> 01:14:31,964
What do you got?

871
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:33,866
I snooped around
a little.

872
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:36,502
Look what I found.

873
01:14:37,837 --> 01:14:39,370
Damn.

874
01:14:39,372 --> 01:14:41,005
The van wasn't even locked.

875
01:14:41,007 --> 01:14:43,174
You'd have to be insane to leave
a vehicle in this neighborhood.

876
01:14:43,176 --> 01:14:45,543
But unlocked, with an
arsenal in the back?

877
01:14:45,545 --> 01:14:47,013
People are too afraid
to steal from her.

878
01:14:48,847 --> 01:14:50,183
I don't think it's fear,
Stan.

879
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,187
It's not some software glitch
that makes this area low crime.

880
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:58,489
It is low crime
because of her.

881
01:14:58,491 --> 01:15:00,558
So how do you wanna play it?

882
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,360
Set up surveillance, apprehend
her when she returns.

883
01:15:03,362 --> 01:15:05,563
- We can take her alive.
- Alive?

884
01:15:05,565 --> 01:15:08,598
She's obviously been watching
Garcia's operation for weeks.

885
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,100
God only knows
what she's figured out.

886
01:15:10,102 --> 01:15:12,902
We get her to talk, we take
down him, his suppliers,

887
01:15:12,904 --> 01:15:14,240
everything and everybody.

888
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:16,440
If the rumors are true,

889
01:15:16,442 --> 01:15:18,875
Garcia has someone tipping
him from the inside.

890
01:15:18,877 --> 01:15:20,844
And she's gotten closer
than we ever will.

891
01:15:20,846 --> 01:15:22,178
I'm gonna head back
to the office,

892
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,180
I'll coordinate
the inter-agency, FBI,

893
01:15:24,182 --> 01:15:27,217
DEA, LAPD,
and Internal Affairs.

894
01:15:27,219 --> 01:15:29,619
Hey, Inman, I have to
tell you something.

895
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:31,957
- Yeah, what?
- I'm sorry.

896
01:16:01,785 --> 01:16:03,219
I know where to find her.

897
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:04,454
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

898
01:16:04,456 --> 01:16:05,888
You gather your crew.

899
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,592
Tell those fuckers it's
time to earn their money.

900
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,827
I don't care if we have
to burn the city down.

901
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:13,999
But this shit ends tonight.
Understood?

902
01:16:49,867 --> 01:16:52,301
Let's get
these motherfuckers.

903
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:53,702
I got someone
in the 911 center.

904
01:16:53,704 --> 01:16:55,971
Any calls from this area
will route through him.

905
01:16:55,973 --> 01:16:57,174
We gotta to do this fast.

906
01:16:59,543 --> 01:17:01,276
Is this smart?

907
01:17:01,278 --> 01:17:03,280
We're announcing ourselves. I
don't know that she's here yet.

908
01:17:03,814 --> 01:17:05,180
If she's here,

909
01:17:05,182 --> 01:17:06,183
we'll find her.

910
01:17:07,151 --> 01:17:08,152
All right, let's go.

911
01:17:17,127 --> 01:17:18,162
- Hey!
- Get up!

912
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:21,532
Get out of here.

913
01:17:29,139 --> 01:17:30,307
Check over there.

914
01:18:23,459 --> 01:18:24,527
Mom.

915
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:30,898
Mom.

916
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,733
You have to wake up, now.

917
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,314
We got something here.

918
01:18:46,316 --> 01:18:48,082
<i>Warehouse,
west of the alley.</i>

919
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:49,252
Whoa, whoa, come on.

920
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:28,423
<i>Talk to me, guys,
what's going on?</i>

921
01:19:31,193 --> 01:19:32,294
<i>Did you find her?</i>

922
01:19:33,428 --> 01:19:35,097
<i>Maybe. Going in now.</i>

923
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:56,551
Holy shit.

924
01:19:57,619 --> 01:19:58,620
Man down.

925
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:34,321
<i>Cortez, we heard gunshots.
Did you get her?</i>

926
01:20:35,424 --> 01:20:36,425
<i>Cortez.</i>

927
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:48,601
Listen to me.

928
01:20:48,603 --> 01:20:50,202
<i>Get outta here.</i>

929
01:20:50,204 --> 01:20:52,337
<i>Leave these people alone.</i>

930
01:20:52,339 --> 01:20:55,541
<i>Just give me Garcia and go.</i>

931
01:20:55,543 --> 01:20:57,943
Or so help me God,
I will kill every

932
01:20:57,945 --> 01:20:59,511
<i>single one of you.</i>

933
01:20:59,513 --> 01:21:00,679
<i>Your choice.</i>

934
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:01,715
She's bluffing!

935
01:21:09,891 --> 01:21:11,592
I can hear the pain
in your voice.

936
01:21:13,227 --> 01:21:14,228
<i>You're hurting.</i>

937
01:21:15,196 --> 01:21:16,430
<i>You're hurting bad.</i>

938
01:21:17,598 --> 01:21:19,765
<i>Out-manned, out-gunned.</i>

939
01:21:19,767 --> 01:21:21,535
How you really think
this is gonna go?

940
01:21:26,774 --> 01:21:29,274
I'm gonna shoot you
in your fucking face.

941
01:21:29,276 --> 01:21:31,412
<i>And then I'll pretty much
figure it out from there.</i>

942
01:21:31,978 --> 01:21:33,079
I'll see you soon.

943
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:49,730
<i>You've
reached Special Agent Lisa Inman.</i>

944
01:21:50,831 --> 01:21:52,566
- She's not answering me, either.
- Shit.

945
01:21:53,266 --> 01:21:54,733
We gotta find her.

946
01:21:54,735 --> 01:21:57,134
See if we can get a location
on Inman's cell phone.

947
01:21:57,136 --> 01:22:00,238
- Find out where it last pinged a tower.
- Yeah, already ahead of you.

948
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,742
Hi, this is
Special Agent Li.

949
01:22:02,576 --> 01:22:04,175
I need
a cell phone location.

950
01:22:04,177 --> 01:22:05,911
- This is Barker, Narcotics.
- Special Agent Lisa Inman.

951
01:22:05,913 --> 01:22:08,112
I need a stingray van
immediately, Los Angeles area.

952
01:22:08,114 --> 01:22:11,650
- 323 555-9357.
- What? Yeah, yeah, right now.

953
01:22:42,682 --> 01:22:44,482
Where's the remote?

954
01:22:44,484 --> 01:22:45,783
Where's the remote for the TV?

955
01:22:45,785 --> 01:22:46,853
- Where's the remote?
- Here.

956
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:51,155
- <i>...prove it to you right now.</i>
- Moises, we got the van.

957
01:22:51,157 --> 01:22:52,225
<i>Look.</i>

958
01:22:54,059 --> 01:22:55,191
Okay.

959
01:22:55,193 --> 01:22:56,294
You see,

960
01:22:56,296 --> 01:22:58,563
<i>that guy is a dirty cop.</i>

961
01:22:58,565 --> 01:22:59,632
Motherfucker.

962
01:23:00,466 --> 01:23:02,800
<i>That scumbag right there,</i>

963
01:23:02,802 --> 01:23:04,402
<i>that is Diego Garcia.</i>

964
01:23:04,404 --> 01:23:06,906
He is the man who killed
my entire family.

965
01:23:10,743 --> 01:23:12,810
<i>If you have a news crew,
come on down,</i>

966
01:23:12,812 --> 01:23:14,679
<i>and if you have a cell phone</i>

967
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:16,581
<i>and you wanna come and
take videos, come on down.</i>

968
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,150
<i>And if you are the LAPD,</i>

969
01:23:19,886 --> 01:23:21,652
<i>this is where the party is.</i>

970
01:23:21,654 --> 01:23:24,187
<i>I'm not going anywhere.
Come and get me.</i>

971
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:25,890
<i>I'm Riley North.
I'm in Skid Row,</i>

972
01:23:25,892 --> 01:23:28,425
<i>I'm on the corner
of Olympic and San Julian.</i>

973
01:23:28,427 --> 01:23:29,860
- We got a location!
- <i>Riley?</i>

974
01:23:29,862 --> 01:23:31,196
Let's go! Let's go!

975
01:23:32,331 --> 01:23:33,933
Let me go! No!

976
01:23:35,534 --> 01:23:36,901
- Stop.
- Hey.

977
01:23:36,903 --> 01:23:39,005
Come on, man.
He's just a kid.

978
01:23:41,173 --> 01:23:43,375
You're in this.
You've always been in this.

979
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:45,011
You want out,

980
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:46,511
just nod.

981
01:23:49,114 --> 01:23:51,249
No, you're right. I'm in.

982
01:23:55,554 --> 01:23:56,953
Maria!

983
01:23:56,955 --> 01:23:59,191
Hey,
soon-to-be dead bitch,

984
01:23:59,691 --> 01:24:01,291
<i>you hear me?</i>

985
01:24:01,293 --> 01:24:03,460
I've got someone here
I want you to meet.

986
01:24:03,462 --> 01:24:04,630
Say your name, sweetheart.

987
01:24:07,432 --> 01:24:08,898
Tell her your name.

988
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,236
My name is Maria.

989
01:24:13,204 --> 01:24:14,270
<i>Maria, here,</i>

990
01:24:14,272 --> 01:24:17,107
she's about to die
because of you.

991
01:24:17,109 --> 01:24:20,977
Damn. You just don't seem to have
any luck with little girls, do you?

992
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:29,153
No! Stop!

993
01:24:30,122 --> 01:24:31,222
I'm gonna count to five.

994
01:24:33,224 --> 01:24:34,793
Then I'm gonna blow
her fucking head off.

995
01:24:36,561 --> 01:24:37,562
One...

996
01:24:38,563 --> 01:24:39,564
No!

997
01:24:40,632 --> 01:24:41,633
Two...

998
01:24:45,302 --> 01:24:46,602
Maria.

999
01:24:46,604 --> 01:24:47,638
Three...

1000
01:24:51,109 --> 01:24:52,110
<i>Four...</i>

1001
01:24:52,844 --> 01:24:54,278
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1002
01:24:55,646 --> 01:24:57,312
SWAT team is
ten minutes behind us.

1003
01:24:57,314 --> 01:24:58,683
Forget it.
We're not waiting.

1004
01:25:14,099 --> 01:25:15,798
Drop the gun!

1005
01:25:34,552 --> 01:25:35,951
Are you okay?

1006
01:25:35,953 --> 01:25:37,319
I knew you'd save me.

1007
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:38,487
I knew it.

1008
01:25:38,489 --> 01:25:39,988
You were right.

1009
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,125
Here I am.

1010
01:25:42,526 --> 01:25:43,527
Let her go.

1011
01:25:54,138 --> 01:25:55,871
You have to go now,
Maria.

1012
01:25:55,873 --> 01:25:57,172
You have to come
with me.

1013
01:25:57,174 --> 01:25:58,539
- I can't. I wish I could.
- No!

1014
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:00,909
- Get her outta here. Come on.
- Just go. Get safe.

1015
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:02,543
No! Please!

1016
01:26:02,545 --> 01:26:05,147
No! No, get off me!
Please!

1017
01:26:05,149 --> 01:26:06,217
Get off me!

1018
01:26:07,017 --> 01:26:08,018
No!

1019
01:26:08,518 --> 01:26:10,221
Stop. Stop.

1020
01:26:18,896 --> 01:26:20,164
Are you scared of me?

1021
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,677
Is this where you have one
of your flunkies shoot me?

1022
01:26:35,512 --> 01:26:36,844
Coward.

1023
01:26:36,846 --> 01:26:38,946
You don't wanna get
your hand dirty, huh?

1024
01:26:41,684 --> 01:26:42,685
Get her up.

1025
01:26:52,095 --> 01:26:53,795
- I'm waiting.
- We gotta get outta here.

1026
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:55,229
She's toying with you.
Stalling.

1027
01:26:55,231 --> 01:26:56,898
- Just get it over with.
- Shut the fuck up!

1028
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,201
Let me have a little fun here.

1029
01:27:02,138 --> 01:27:03,206
No!

1030
01:27:07,777 --> 01:27:09,478
You hit like a girl.

1031
01:27:14,483 --> 01:27:15,484
Oh, Jesus.

1032
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:19,255
You see that?
She ain't toying with shit.

1033
01:27:24,794 --> 01:27:27,661
I must say that
I'm a bit disappointed.

1034
01:27:27,663 --> 01:27:29,629
I thought you were
gonna put on a real fight.

1035
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:30,732
Make it fun for me.

1036
01:27:33,802 --> 01:27:34,938
You wanna hear a secret?

1037
01:27:39,275 --> 01:27:41,008
You should've
listened to Carmichael.

1038
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:49,016
<i>LAPD.
Stay where you are.</i>

1039
01:27:49,018 --> 01:27:50,485
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

1040
01:27:52,454 --> 01:27:53,455
Police!

1041
01:27:57,193 --> 01:27:58,194
Police!

1042
01:27:59,962 --> 01:28:01,262
Police!

1043
01:28:01,264 --> 01:28:02,464
- You sold me, <i>puto.</i>
- No!

1044
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:14,641
Uh, you guys can't
go through here. Stay back.

1045
01:28:14,643 --> 01:28:15,644
Yo, hey!

1046
01:28:20,649 --> 01:28:21,650
Move! Move!

1047
01:28:44,705 --> 01:28:46,041
Out of my fucking way!

1048
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:04,423
Riley North!

1049
01:29:04,425 --> 01:29:06,859
Step back! We got him.

1050
01:29:06,861 --> 01:29:08,761
We'll take care of it.

1051
01:29:08,763 --> 01:29:10,663
Like you did last time?

1052
01:29:10,665 --> 01:29:12,498
No, he ain't getting away.

1053
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,101
Just drop the gun.

1054
01:29:17,838 --> 01:29:19,239
Riley!

1055
01:29:19,241 --> 01:29:20,375
On the ground!

1056
01:29:21,475 --> 01:29:23,878
Don't do it.
I'm begging you.

1057
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:28,948
Please, Riley.

1058
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:30,616
You're a crazy ass.

1059
01:29:30,618 --> 01:29:33,788
You'll spend more time
in prison than me.

1060
01:29:36,223 --> 01:29:37,925
We're not going to prison.

1061
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:45,465
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1062
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:47,368
Fuck!

1063
01:30:02,049 --> 01:30:03,150
Where the hell is she?

1064
01:30:14,661 --> 01:30:17,465
Airship, Airship, what do you see?
You got eyes on anything?

1065
01:30:18,798 --> 01:30:21,601
<i>Negative. Negative.
We lost visual.</i>

1066
01:30:24,405 --> 01:30:25,803
Total clusterfuck.

1067
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:27,905
She could be anywhere.

1068
01:30:27,907 --> 01:30:29,776
We're setting a perimeter
ten blocks out, but...

1069
01:30:30,244 --> 01:30:31,410
Who knows?

1070
01:30:31,412 --> 01:30:32,912
Don't bother.
I know where she's going.

1071
01:31:22,529 --> 01:31:23,796
I've missed you.

1072
01:31:24,864 --> 01:31:26,399
I've missed you so much.

1073
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,902
I miss you so much.

1074
01:31:40,313 --> 01:31:41,314
Riley.

1075
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,317
My husband.

1076
01:31:44,883 --> 01:31:46,018
My daughter.

1077
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:50,223
They're waiting for me.

1078
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,090
Please, just let me die.

1079
01:31:53,092 --> 01:31:54,327
I can't do that.

1080
01:31:57,497 --> 01:31:59,432
This isn't where
the story ends.

1081
01:32:02,535 --> 01:32:03,869
It is for me.

1082
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:18,016
Need an RA! Now!

1083
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,700
<i>Thank you.
So is Riley North a vigilante,</i>

1084
01:32:37,702 --> 01:32:41,071
<i>folk hero, common criminal,
or all of the above?</i>

1085
01:32:41,073 --> 01:32:45,609
<i>Public opinion seems largely in support
of her, but the law may not agree.</i>

1086
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:48,979
<i>The LAPD's stance was clarified
just an hour ago</i>

1087
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:51,148
<i>by Chief Matthew Rogers.</i>

1088
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:54,750
<i>The Los Angeles Police
Department's position is clear.</i>

1089
01:32:54,752 --> 01:32:57,454
<i>Riley North will answer
for her actions.</i>

1090
01:32:57,456 --> 01:33:00,557
<i>And she will stand trial
for multiple counts of homicide.</i>

1091
01:33:00,559 --> 01:33:01,959
<i>Questions?</i>

1092
01:33:05,963 --> 01:33:09,266
How you doing? Detective Beltran.
I'll take over for a bit.

1093
01:33:09,268 --> 01:33:10,668
Why don't you grab
yourself a cup of coffee?

1094
01:33:11,135 --> 01:33:12,170
Okay.

1095
01:33:23,448 --> 01:33:24,449
Hi, Riley.

1096
01:33:27,653 --> 01:33:28,654
Remember me?

1097
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:32,857
How you feeling?

1098
01:33:37,094 --> 01:33:39,997
You killed a lot of
very bad people.

1099
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:44,535
You took down
a massive drug operation.

1100
01:33:46,304 --> 01:33:49,104
Exposed dirty bastards,

1101
01:33:49,106 --> 01:33:50,508
in my own department.

1102
01:33:53,611 --> 01:33:57,215
There's not a cop I know
that...

1103
01:33:58,683 --> 01:33:59,684
Well,

1104
01:34:01,953 --> 01:34:05,990
let's just say, some of us wish
things didn't have to be this way.

1105
01:34:15,032 --> 01:34:16,032
Well...

1106
01:34:21,071 --> 01:34:22,240
Hope you get better soon.

1107
01:34:42,227 --> 01:34:47,227

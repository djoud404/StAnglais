2
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,383
- You don't remember me, do you?
- Fuck you! Fuck...

3
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:43,914
Jose, she's here.

4
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,484
Did she find it?

5
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,504
Don't wave.

6
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,250
All right.

7
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:49,272
<i>Mom, hurry up.</i>

8
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:51,207
Mom!

9
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:57,377
- Riley!
- She's back.

10
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,780
- Riley!
- Just keep going.

11
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:01,949
I know
you can hear me.

12
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:04,620
Honestly, I don't know
what you were thinking.

13
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:08,688
Sorry, Peg.
I said I was sorry.

14
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,523
This parking lot is
where we set up.

15
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:13,960
Everybody knows that,
from here to the Pottery Barn.

16
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,163
We have earned this spot
because we sell

17
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,798
more Firefly Christmas
baked cookies than anyone.

18
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,369
Maybe if you actually showed up to a Den
Mother meeting, you'd know these...

19
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:24,204
Well, not all of us can sit around
in our perfect little houses

20
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,705
south of the Boulevard,
Peg.

21
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:26,708
Some of us have to work.

22
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:33,213
I will be lodging
a formal grievance

23
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,651
- at the next Den Mother meeting.
- Okay, you do that.

24
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,587
I don't think you're
Firefly Troop material.

25
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:41,590
Neither one of you.

26
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:43,558
Come on, Penelope.

27
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:52,812
What an asshole.

28
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,669
- Don't say that.
- Well, she is.

29
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:57,739
Well, maybe so.
But still...

30
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:00,675
You should've punched
her lights out.

31
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:06,578
Punched
her lights out, huh?

32
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,681
You can't go around punching
people who are jerks.

33
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:11,251
Then you're just as
bad as they are.

34
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,889
Mom, I know you took
the morning off work.

35
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:17,092
Thanks, for trying
to help me.

36
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,129
Do you know
how amazing you are?

37
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,799
Happy birthday,
get in the car.

38
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:28,203
Run, run, run.
Go, go, go.

39
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,050
Listen, I wouldn't ask...

40
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:34,209
When do you think?

41
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,111
Next month.

42
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:39,547
Right. Yeah, thanks.

43
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:03,168
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, squirt.

44
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,470
- Oh, how are you?
- Hey.

45
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:05,838
- I'm good.
- Good.

46
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,940
- I should be home by 4:30.
- Okay.

47
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,775
Someone's gonna have a birthday party.

48
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,609
The other kids
will be there by 4:00.

49
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,247
Can you handle 30
minutes on your own?

50
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,147
How many other kids?

51
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,016
All my friends, Daddy.

52
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:20,853
Chris North, everything in your life
has prepared you for this moment.

53
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:22,488
Oh, hey, I'm late. Love you.

54
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,654
Love you, bye.

55
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:25,590
- Love you.
- Bye, guys. Bye!

56
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,294
Come here,
birthday girl. Oh!

57
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:32,297
Oh, hi, Mr. Watson.
I'm late. Sorry.

58
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,665
Well, we'll talk about it later. I
gotta do some Christmas shopping.

59
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,002
- Okay.
- And I need you to close today.

60
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,770
- Oh, today is actually...
- Dee Dee called in sick.

61
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,305
So you're closing.

62
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,006
- It's my daughter's birthday...
- You asked for extra hours.

63
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:44,445
I'm giving them to you.
You're closing.

64
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:52,850
Are you sure, Mickey?
Are you really sure?

65
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,652
- 'Cause, don't put me in a situation...
- I got kids too, man.

66
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,527
Ten minutes, our lives change.
Our kids' lives change.

67
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:04,329
Nobody knows, nobody will know,
all you gotta do is drive.

68
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:05,830
I'll take care
of everything else.

69
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:07,468
I don't know, Mickey.
I don't know.

70
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:12,670
You wanna get Riley a house, right?
Good school for Carly.

71
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:15,075
This greasy hand shit, it's
not gonna get you there, man.

72
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:16,709
This will.

73
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:30,723
Hi!

74
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,057
I'm here.

75
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,727
Happy birth...

76
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:38,898
Where's everybody?

77
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:43,069
Nobody came.

78
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,871
Nobody came?

79
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:55,580
<i>Riley, Peg.</i>

80
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,348
<i>Let's forget
that little snafu</i>

81
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,450
<i>in the parking lot
ever happened.</i>

82
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:01,885
<i>We're having a little
holiday get-together today,</i>

83
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,753
<i>Penelope invited
the whole class.</i>

84
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:07,057
<i>I think Carly's invite must
have gotten lost in the mail.</i>

85
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,094
<i>Feel free to stop by. If you're
not doing anything else.</i>

86
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:14,298
<i>I'm sure you remember the address.
South of the Boulevard.</i>

87
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,533
<i>Hope to see you guys.</i>

88
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,369
Told you.

89
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:20,404
You should've punched
her lights out.

90
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:31,551
You know what,
buddy?

91
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,122
We don't need them
anyway.

92
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,624
It's your birthday.

93
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:41,091
My birthday sucks!

94
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,593
Carly, language.

95
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:43,729
It does.

96
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,567
We're gonna go out
for pizza.

97
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:53,170
Um, we are, just the three of us.
It'll be fun.

98
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,805
And then we're gonna go... we're
gonna go to the Christmas carnival.

99
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,008
- Yeah!
- Oh! Yes, the Christmas carnival.

100
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,777
And when we get there,
we are gonna ride every ride,

101
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:03,446
and play every game.

102
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:06,650
We'll do all the virus and
germ infested... Whatever.

103
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:08,817
But I'm good with that, it's your birthday.

104
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,686
- And then...
- Ice cream?

105
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:12,422
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream. Yes!

106
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:15,025
Heck, yes. Ice cream, yes,
as much as you want.

107
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:17,793
All right, we're gonna have
a big night. Go get a jacket.

108
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,915
- Let's go, go, go.
- Yeah! I'll be ready in a second.

109
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:27,370
I'm sorry, I just...

110
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:28,540
Hey, honey...

111
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:31,376
it's not always
gonna be like this.

112
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:32,977
You promise?

113
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,381
Yeah. I promise.

114
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:38,015
Come here.

115
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,224
<i>This is Mickey. I'm not here
right now, please leave a message.</i>

116
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,662
Mickey, hey, it's Chris.

117
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,197
I'm out.

118
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:54,832
I'm not risking it.

119
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:58,702
It's not worth it, man.

120
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:01,505
All right, listen, I'm sorry. Uh,
give me a call when you get this.

121
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:05,507
- Where's your dad?
- He's out here.

122
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:06,510
Oh, good.

123
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:10,079
Carnival! Yay!

124
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,082
All right.

125
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:12,817
Here we go.

126
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,821
Carnival.
I'm so excited.

127
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:20,222
<i>â™ª Jingle all the way</i>

128
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:25,496
It's me. Is the boss around?

129
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:28,165
I found the other one.

130
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:32,769
Seriously,
you trying to rip me off?

131
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:37,375
Did you really think you were
gonna get away with it, Mickey?

132
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,908
Hey, boss, it's for you.

133
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,911
It's Cortez.

134
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,118
I have to take
this phone call.

135
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,421
I hope you don't mind,
Mickey.

136
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:54,423
Talk to me.
What you got?

137
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,825
<i>I'm tailing the other guy.
What do you want me to do?</i>

138
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,362
Smoke him.

139
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:00,864
Make an example.

140
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,033
A loud one.

141
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,205
Mickey,

142
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:12,442
is this what you wanted?

143
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,942
Huh?

144
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:16,781
Is this gonna make
all your problems go away?

145
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,152
Feels good, huh?

146
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,456
Have some folding cash
on you.

147
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:28,759
Right?

148
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:30,960
Right?

149
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,096
Fucking <i>puto.</i>

150
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,470
Yay! I'm the king!

151
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,145
Give me that one.

152
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,150
High five!

153
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,686
I kept my eyes open
almost the whole... Oh!

154
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:00,488
Oh, I hope
I look smart.

155
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,625
- Aw. Not so much.
- Look at me.

156
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:05,693
You're a booger.

157
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:07,615
- Pretty charming.
- Oh, ice cream!

158
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,265
Let's get ice cream.

159
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,276
- Come on.
- We're coming, we're coming.

160
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,378
Hey,
what'll it be?

161
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,214
Uh, two of your finest
Rocky Roads, and...

162
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,015
Yes, and whatever
the little lady...

163
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,517
Peppermint.
Double scoop.

164
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,885
And a peppermint
double scoop.

165
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,153
- All right.
- It's her birthday.

166
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:34,875
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

167
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:59,413
- ...with the...
- Yeah, I agree.

168
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,381
Goodness,
look at that.

169
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:02,418
Can I try that?

170
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,820
Do you like it?

171
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:08,795
- Birthday, kiddo.
- Bye, sweetie pie.

172
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:16,897
- I'll grab a napkin.
- Okay.

173
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:17,999
Okay.

174
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,501
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, you got it.

175
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,143
- Thank you. Have a good night.
- Bye-bye.

176
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:31,110
- I know. Every day!
- We're gonna have your birthday every day.

177
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:32,672
Hey, make sure we can
get it in the car.

178
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,221
Ready?

179
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:24,491
Three, two...

180
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:29,193
Adult female, 35 years old.
Gunshot wound to the head.

181
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:31,398
Severe cerebral hemorrhaging,
vitals holding.

182
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,199
Closing up.

183
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:36,003
We're good.

184
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:40,674
Can I take a look?

185
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:00,658
It's messed up,
I get it.

186
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,527
But you need to get
your game face on.

187
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,064
We got a job here,
all right?

188
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,536
Shit ain't easy
when it's a kid.

189
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:12,171
It's not
supposed to be easy.

190
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:15,174
That's the difference
between us and them.

191
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,294
You were
supposed to call me the moment she woke up.

192
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,463
You don't wake up
from a medically-induced coma

193
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:40,865
like flipping on
a light switch.

194
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,432
The gunshot may have
missed her brain,

195
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,874
- but the cerebral swelling...
- But she's gonna be all right?

196
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,907
"All right,"
is out of my hands.

197
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,276
When her memory returned
she...

198
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:55,198
We had to restrain her
and she had to be sedated.

199
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,450
Mrs. North.

200
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:02,586
- My name is Detective Stan Carmichael...
- Detective.

201
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:05,224
I've been waiting
to speak to you for a long time.

202
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:11,128
I'm very sorry for your loss.

203
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,132
Forgive me for jumping in so abruptly,
but we have three suspects in custody,

204
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,067
who we otherwise will have
to release tomorrow.

205
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:18,835
Detective, this is
really not the time.

206
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:21,340
I... I can talk.

207
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:29,581
We think that what happened
may be linked to your husband.

208
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,582
There were rumors
he was involved

209
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:34,417
in a plan to rob
a drug dealer

210
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:36,119
named Diego Garcia.

211
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:37,821
He wouldn't have to...
He wouldn't do that.

212
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,923
No, yes,
you're absolutely right.

213
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,025
We recovered a voicemail
on his friend's telephone,

214
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:44,163
your husband did refuse
to go along with it, but,

215
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,495
word had already gotten out.

216
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,667
And got back to Garcia.

217
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:53,502
Now, an informant has given
us a very credible lead,

218
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,039
but no witnesses
are willing to step up.

219
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,443
We know everything,
but can't prove anything.

220
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:03,947
Detective.

221
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:05,150
I think that's enough now.

222
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,288
You get some rest,
Mrs. North, I'll come back.

223
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,058
But I, uh...

224
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,494
thought you might
wanna have this.

225
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:48,493
I saw them.

226
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:52,228
<i>All right, bring 'em out.</i>

227
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,363
Let's go.
Get in there.

228
00:21:09,412 --> 00:21:10,447
Um...

229
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:12,716
It's number five.

230
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:15,552
Number five,
step forward.

231
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:21,259
Take 'em out.
Next group.

232
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:32,936
Number three.

233
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:35,705
Number three,
step forward.

234
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,411
That's him.

235
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,451
Four.

236
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:54,224
Hmm.

237
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:58,128
Are you sure?

238
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,469
Yes, I'm sure.

239
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:14,277
Hey, thanks.

240
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:25,407
What's the matter,
you not hungry?

241
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:29,960
Tell me what that is.

242
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:34,661
That would be
a detective badge.

243
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:38,434
That would be all they found on the
last cop who went after Diego Garcia.

244
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,338
It was in his locker,
hanging in his locker here,

245
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,976
inside
Metro Homicide Headquarters.

246
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:49,012
Garcia has people
on the inside?

247
00:22:51,614 --> 00:22:56,016
Garcia has a nickname,
<i>La Guillotine.</i>

248
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:57,820
There's a reason
for that shit, Stan.

249
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:01,189
Chris North didn't even
rob Garcia.

250
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:07,295
He just considered it, and he's on the
wrong side of the grass with his kid.

251
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:10,365
Whatever happens with
this case, let it happen.

252
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,832
Don't be stupid.

253
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,036
You'll only get dead
and it won't change anything.

254
00:24:03,785 --> 00:24:04,786
Hello?

255
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,691
- Oh, Mrs. North.
- Who are you?

256
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:14,227
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

257
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:17,199
Um, I'm...
I'm a friend.

258
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:19,767
Uh, do you
wanna have a seat?

259
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:21,469
What do you want?

260
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,771
Eviction notice.

261
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:29,909
I can only imagine how
awful all of this has been for you.

262
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:32,611
I mean, how does one even begin to
recover from something like that?

263
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:35,081
Why are you here?

264
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,086
I just, uh... I just wanna
give you a bit of advice.

265
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:46,058
The road to recovery
has to begin somewhere.

266
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:52,333
The recognition that um...
as gut-wrenching as it is,

267
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:58,740
in the end, nothing's gonna
bring your family back.

268
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:05,146
I know, and that's the regrettable,
yet unavoidable truth.

269
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,583
Eventually, maybe
not right away,

270
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:14,355
but eventually it'll be
time for you to move on.

271
00:25:15,522 --> 00:25:19,260
New place, new clothes,
new memories.

272
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:27,801
A new life.

273
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,111
What is this?

274
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,285
Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone?
That's an antipsychotic.

275
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:48,288
Hey!

276
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:53,459
I think it's time
for you to leave.

277
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,393
Maybe you've made
a mistake.

278
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:57,695
Your memory is
a little hazy.

279
00:25:57,697 --> 00:25:59,297
I'm just
putting it out there.

280
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,399
Maybe you didn't see things

281
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,681
the way you thought
you saw them.

282
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:04,037
Hmm?

283
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:07,908
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!

284
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:09,910
Get out!

285
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:14,214
You think that
you're gonna have justice?

286
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:17,217
Make them all pay?

287
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:20,752
They won't.

288
00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:21,888
Get the fuck out!

289
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:39,003
Is there anything else you would
like to ask the witness, Mr. Henderson?

290
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:40,838
One last question,
Your Honor.

291
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,341
Mrs. North,
just to clarify one point.

292
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:44,877
Did you see them
get out of the car?

293
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,046
- No.
- Hmm.

294
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:49,882
Did the car ever stop moving?

295
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:52,950
No.

296
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:56,122
And yet you identified my clients
as the alleged shooters?

297
00:26:57,723 --> 00:26:59,591
- They did it.
- Objection, Your Honor.

298
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:00,757
Calls for legal conclusion.

299
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,759
Sustained.

300
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:04,928
- Mrs. North, we're interested in facts. Not opinions.
- He just asked me a question

301
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,130
- and I just answered.
- It's okay.

302
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:09,032
You identified
my clients, correct?

303
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:11,268
- Yes, I did. They did it...
- Okay. Okay.

304
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,142
And are you currently on any
antipsychotic medications?

305
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,976
What?

306
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:21,478
- Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone?
- Wait.

307
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,247
- Is there anything else we should know about?
- But that's not...

308
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:25,716
- Wait, that's not accurate.
- You identified not one, but three men

309
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:28,452
in a moving vehicle
at night from 30 feet.

310
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:29,953
- After a month in a coma...
- I saw them.

311
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:31,755
- and a mental breakdown...
- It's not something you forget.

312
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:33,891
And under the influence of antidepressant
and antipsychotic medications.

313
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:35,592
Excuse me,
he's not listening to me!

314
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:38,430
Is it possible that your recollection
isn't what you thought it was?

315
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:41,567
No.

316
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:47,404
No further questions,
Your Honor.

317
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:49,573
Wait, but you're not hearing me.
Can you help me out?

318
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:52,075
You're the district attorney.
Can't you do anything?

319
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:53,809
I didn't even
take those pills...

320
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:56,513
It is the opinion of this court
that in this preliminary hearing,

321
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,348
the evidence is insufficient

322
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,783
for a juror
to reasonably conclude

323
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:03,986
that the State has met
its burden of proof.

324
00:28:03,988 --> 00:28:07,326
I see no reason to hold
the defendants over for trial.

325
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:21,137
Wait a minute.
This can't be over.

326
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:23,940
- These men killed my family.
- Mrs. North, you're excused.

327
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,509
No, they killed my family!

328
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:27,511
- This guy showed up in my house.
- You are excused, Mrs. North.

329
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:29,212
No, I am not finished!

330
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:31,347
- You are excused, Mrs... Mrs. North.
- He offered me money!

331
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,849
- No, no, no! I am not done!
- Mrs. North, you're excused!

332
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:36,811
- They are killers! They're fucking killers!
- Mrs. North. Bailiffs!

333
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:41,290
Get away from me!
I'm gonna kill them.

334
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:55,673
Bailiffs,
remove this woman.

335
00:28:57,475 --> 00:29:01,312
Mrs. North, I'm remanding you to a
mental health treatment program.

336
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:03,379
Next case.

337
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:16,092
Why is she bleeding?
What happened?

338
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:18,229
She wouldn't stop banging
her head into the bars.

339
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,032
- She's all yours now.
- All right.

340
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:26,868
Mrs. North? Riley,
it's Detective Stan Carmichael.

341
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,936
Do you hear me?

342
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:29,771
Hey, guys,
come on, come on.

343
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:31,773
She saw her family get murdered and
the guys who did it just walked.

344
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,043
How about you lighten up?

345
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,415
Clear?
One, two, three.

346
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,087
- Where is she going?
- County General, psych hold.

347
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:46,589
That place is a nightmare.

348
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:49,592
County General, psych hold.

349
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:51,714
That place is a nightmare.

350
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,032
Hang on. Let me make a call.

351
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:01,305
Hey!

352
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:05,242
- You all right?
- Yeah.

353
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:08,278
Sorry.

354
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:39,643
Well, you called it.

355
00:30:44,247 --> 00:30:45,680
She'll turn up.

356
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:47,484
One way or another,
they always do.

357
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,976
Carmichael, 3-8-7-7,
Gang Homicide.

358
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:30,657
Don't you look especially
pretty this morning.

359
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,326
Thanks for showing up.

360
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:34,296
I've always been a firm
believer in beauty sleep.

361
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,500
Pro tip.

362
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:41,504
Wait until you're dead
before you embalm yourself.

363
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:47,510
Well,

364
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:49,978
that's new.

365
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,589
- Good morning, Lisa. You got a minute?
- What?

366
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:38,558
Somebody drove a truck
into a gun store

367
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,761
out in San Bernardino
a couple of nights ago.

368
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:42,729
The place was
a class-three dealer

369
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:44,230
and military-grade stuff.

370
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:47,099
ATF called us after reviewing
the security footage.

371
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:50,303
Uh, it was a woman. They got a
partial frame of the suspect's face.

372
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,572
Give it to
the DHS Fusion Center.

373
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:54,908
Let them run it through
their facial recognition system.

374
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,376
I did. Got a possible match
from customs

375
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:59,612
on a stowaway incident,
container ship,

376
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:02,215
at the Port of LA
three months ago.

377
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:04,619
Uh, your name popped up
on the case file, so I...

378
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,259
Inman.

379
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,429
Inman.

380
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,341
Are you maybe thinking
what I'm thinking?

381
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,184
Carmichael.

382
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,354
Who?

383
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:42,957
Yeah, sure.

384
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:46,091
The FBI wants to talk to us.

385
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,127
Feds?

386
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:14,079
Did you guys
run out of terrorists?

387
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:16,680
How come the feds care about
a squirrelly soccer mom?

388
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:18,449
Didn't she smack you in
the head five years ago?

389
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,852
Smacking dumbasses
ain't a federal offense.

390
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:21,920
Ha-ha.

391
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:23,955
Bank robbery is.

392
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,556
The night Riley North
got away from you,

393
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:28,525
she stole $55,000 from the
bank where she was employed.

394
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,895
Are we talking about the same Riley North?
Bank robbery?

395
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:35,466
Mm-hmm. She just disappeared,
completely off the grid,

396
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,635
as if she just ceased to be.

397
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,703
You're shitting me.
She wasn't the type.

398
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,271
I agree.

399
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:44,308
A woman with no priors, even if
her family is brutally murdered

400
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,646
doesn't just up and take
50 large and then take off.

401
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,614
Got my attention.

402
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:57,155
How many times did you
betray your oath, Your Honor?

403
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:03,093
I think that you're so goddamn
corrupt, I don't even stand out.

404
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:06,164
Well...

405
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,901
So, here's the deal.

406
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:14,073
If you can tell me my name,
I'll let you live.

407
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:17,841
I mean, you'll eat out of a
tube the rest of your life,

408
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,176
but you'll live.

409
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,179
You ready?

410
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:27,787
Do you remember my name?

411
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,591
Interpol tagged her
four months later.

412
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,494
Used her real name in a
hospital in Hong Kong.

413
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,931
Showed up with
a dislocated shoulder,

414
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,133
facial fracture,
ruptured spleen.

415
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:44,968
- Car wreck?
- Don't know.

416
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,869
She left before we could
have her apprehended.

417
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,304
She vanished.

418
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,373
Every now and then, a lead
trickles in from somewhere.

419
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,043
Some we can almost
substantiate, some we can't.

420
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:56,146
She's a shit magnet. Why
are you wasting our time?

421
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:57,348
Then we found this
on YouTube.

422
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,958
Wait, that's...
that's Riley North?

423
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,827
Herself,
in Europe last year,

424
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,496
under one of the four identities
we've tracked so far.

425
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,665
She got really, really good
at staying off the radar.

426
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,701
So she spends the last five years
bouncing around the world,

427
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,405
learning how to
get into trouble. And?

428
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,140
We don't exactly know
what she was doing.

429
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,842
What we do know,
is that she arrived in L.A.

430
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,045
three months ago.

431
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:32,715
Security cameras got this during a
gun shop burglary a few days ago.

432
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,751
She only took military grade.

433
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,888
Automatic rifles, high-capacity
shotguns, specific ammunition.

434
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,159
She knew exactly
what she was looking for.

435
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,693
She's back.

436
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,595
And today, you found the three guys
that allegedly killed her family.

437
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,733
Strung up, execution style.

438
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,769
Do you know what
the date is today?

439
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,436
- Come again?
- The date.

440
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,604
What's today's date?

441
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,008
It's December 21st.

442
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:00,377
Five-year anniversary
of her family's murder.

443
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:10,385
This stuff wrapped around you
is det cord, explosive rope.

444
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:11,953
You can cut through anything
with this.

445
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:14,958
Cut through trees,
cut through concrete...

446
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:16,927
Corrupt judges.

447
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,611
Watching someone
take everything from you.

448
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:38,382
All you have,

449
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,218
all you're ever gonna have,

450
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,221
just gone.

451
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:46,924
Hurts, doesn't it?

452
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,594
And knowing that it's all over,

453
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,065
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

454
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,637
You didn't serve justice,
Your Honor. I will.

455
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:50,853
Carmichael. Hm-hmm.

456
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:53,222
What?

457
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,658
Okay.

458
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:57,860
Thanks.

459
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:01,061
Steven Goldman
and Robert Henderson,

460
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:02,696
the DA and attorney
at that hearing,

461
00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:04,899
- five years ago?
- Yeah.

462
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:06,901
Goldman was found face down
in his swimming pool

463
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:09,003
and Henderson's house
burned down with him in it,

464
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,405
last night, both of them.

465
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,907
And that's not all.

466
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:14,675
LAPD bomb squad
is currently onsite

467
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:16,576
at the residence
of one James Stevens,

468
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:19,346
criminal court judge,
recently retired.

469
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:22,182
Some sort of explosion
at his house.

470
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:24,465
There's barely enough left of
him to fill an evidence bag.

471
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:27,988
Don't think I need
to tell you who he was.

472
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,160
We gotta go wide with this.
APB, the media, the whole deal.

473
00:40:47,676 --> 00:40:49,544
That looks good. Stack it up.

474
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:04,857
We need
to talk to you.

475
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:06,295
- We have a problem.
- What?

476
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:11,633
Just a minute.

477
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:15,036
Our informant called.

478
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:17,904
She got a judge
and, uh...

479
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:19,572
And a lawyer
we paid off.

480
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:21,374
Smoked some of
our homies, too.

481
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:22,978
The ones we sent
to take out her husband.

482
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,244
When the fuck was this?

483
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:26,980
Like, five years ago.

484
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:27,983
Is there
a problem?

485
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,318
No, just uh...

486
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:34,153
Go and get Jessica
out of the car,

487
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:35,790
bring her in
with a couple of drinks.

488
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:38,226
And that thing?

489
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:43,329
Put a paycheck
on her head,

490
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:44,399
call it a day.

491
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:53,605
Some personnel stuff.

492
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:54,775
You know how it goes.

493
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:56,808
Got ten more tons...

494
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,677
Your bullshit
ain't why I'm here.

495
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,982
You know, you shouldn't
play games with the cartel.

496
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,186
I came to deliver a message
from my father.

497
00:42:15,596 --> 00:42:17,029
It's just a misunderstanding.

498
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:18,599
One shipment goes missing,

499
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,001
maybe it's a mistake.

500
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:22,870
But two?

501
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:25,771
In a week?

502
00:42:25,773 --> 00:42:27,639
You think I tried
to steal from you?

503
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:29,511
That I lasted this long
by being stupid?

504
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:34,480
Everybody wants to be
a big dog.

505
00:42:34,482 --> 00:42:36,648
Little dogs
trying to eat my food.

506
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,684
That's all it is.

507
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:41,789
Hey, baby.

508
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:00,240
Get the fuck outta here.

509
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:07,481
There's something
you need to remember.

510
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,321
You are still
a little dog.

511
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,658
Don't let our business
be interfered with again.

512
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:57,763
Who's that for?

513
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:00,766
It's for you.

514
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:03,102
Thanks.

515
00:44:06,372 --> 00:44:07,373
Is he okay?

516
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:10,441
He drinks.

517
00:44:10,443 --> 00:44:13,944
I have to take care
of him sometimes.

518
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:16,346
<i>Stop requested.
Please use rear...</i>

519
00:44:22,155 --> 00:44:23,655
Dad. Come on.

520
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:26,626
Bye.

521
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:29,761
I told you
not to speak to strangers.

522
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:32,762
Hey.

523
00:44:32,764 --> 00:44:34,233
Where'd you get
that shitty toy?

524
00:44:36,302 --> 00:44:37,936
Sit. Sit.

525
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:48,512
Give me your wallet.

526
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:49,515
Oh, okay.

527
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:51,615
Okay.

528
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:53,257
I'm gonna need you
to stand still, please.

529
00:44:57,856 --> 00:45:00,190
All right.
What do we have here?

530
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:02,260
Bryan Hartley,
1214 Harlow Street.

531
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:04,796
Open your mouth, Bryan.

532
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:10,133
This is one of those
life-altering moments.

533
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:11,768
Do I have your attention?

534
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:15,338
I want you to take your boy
Christmas shopping.

535
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,508
I want you to give him
the time of his life.

536
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,550
I want you to grow up and
be the father he deserves.

537
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:22,545
Do you understand me?

538
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:24,180
I understand.

539
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:25,815
- Say it again.
- I understand.

540
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:27,517
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

541
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,152
1214 Harlow.

542
00:45:29,154 --> 00:45:30,722
I will never forget you,
Bryan.

543
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:32,390
Are we clear?

544
00:45:34,226 --> 00:45:35,325
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

545
00:45:35,327 --> 00:45:36,487
What are you still
doing here?

546
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:43,199
Come on.

547
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:46,169
You ever sell him anything else and I
will blow you and this place to bits.

548
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:47,570
- Do you understand?
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:49,038
- Do you have a car?
- Yeah.

550
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,041
Give me the keys.

551
00:45:51,742 --> 00:45:52,910
Consider it a rental.

552
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:56,271
Hey.

553
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:57,773
You're in the wrong place.

554
00:46:57,775 --> 00:46:59,241
Oh, actually I'm not.

555
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:00,377
Get the fuck out of here.

556
00:47:33,444 --> 00:47:35,577
- What's up, man?
- What's going on?

557
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,514
Listen, I'm about to get
this money, homes.

558
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:01,602
<i>...in this normally
quiet upscale neighborhood.</i>

559
00:48:01,604 --> 00:48:03,304
<i>Maureen, can you tell us more?</i>

560
00:48:03,306 --> 00:48:05,439
<i>What do we know about
the suspected bomber?</i>

561
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:08,476
<i>North is suspected to
have been behind today's bombing</i>

562
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:11,445
<i>and of possibly killing
up to five others.</i>

563
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:15,015
<i>Authorities believe her to be
armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

564
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,821
<i>If you see her, please contact the
police at the number on the screen.</i>

565
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:40,907
<i>...so called
"sweet killer."</i>

566
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:43,544
<i>What could be expected
for her next move?</i>

567
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:46,014
<i>What will the law enforcement
agencies respond with?</i>

568
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:54,657
What the fuck?

569
00:48:59,161 --> 00:49:00,694
Come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

570
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:01,697
Come on!

571
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:10,871
Oh, shit.

572
00:50:58,546 --> 00:50:59,847
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

573
00:51:00,714 --> 00:51:02,548
I have questions for you.

574
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:03,651
You're not busy, are you?

575
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:06,019
No.

576
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,954
<i>A fire has partially
destroyed this downtown pinata store,</i>

577
00:51:08,956 --> 00:51:12,024
Crazy.
Crazy, crazy.

578
00:51:12,026 --> 00:51:15,027
She's fucking crazy, man.

579
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:17,229
You already said that,
Marvin.

580
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:18,897
Yeah, well,
I'm saying it again.

581
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:20,966
So, you decided
to tell her everything.

582
00:51:20,968 --> 00:51:23,302
The whole damn operation.

583
00:51:23,304 --> 00:51:27,039
Yeah, but you guys would have
done the same thing. It's...

584
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,577
I'm so impressed by how
fucking stupid you are.

585
00:51:30,477 --> 00:51:32,076
How much
did she take?

586
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:35,081
She... Well, she
didn't take anything. She...

587
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:38,351
She burned all the money.

588
00:51:44,592 --> 00:51:47,059
It's the last fucking shit
that I need right now.

589
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:48,694
Boss, I'm so sorry.

590
00:51:48,696 --> 00:51:50,094
You know that
I would never...

591
00:51:50,096 --> 00:51:51,429
It's just these were
some extenuating...

592
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:52,733
Shut the fuck up!

593
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,437
Trust me, we will
have a short...

594
00:51:59,439 --> 00:52:02,042
a very short conversation
about this in a minute.

595
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:08,212
Double security.

596
00:52:08,214 --> 00:52:10,550
Put that bitch
in a box before sunset.

597
00:52:12,052 --> 00:52:13,686
Before she
gets us all killed.

598
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:16,854
<i>Thank you, Joanna.</i>

599
00:52:16,856 --> 00:52:18,456
<i>Today, Los Angeles
has witnessed</i>

600
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,691
<i>a disturbing series
of violent events</i>

601
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:23,761
<i>which some are speculating
are part of a pattern,</i>

602
00:52:23,763 --> 00:52:26,631
<i>possibly even the work
of a single suspect.</i>

603
00:52:26,633 --> 00:52:29,400
<i>According to sources at the
Los Angeles Police Department,</i>

604
00:52:29,402 --> 00:52:31,902
<i>everything seems to lead
to the same name,</i>

605
00:52:31,904 --> 00:52:33,204
<i>Riley North.</i>

606
00:52:33,206 --> 00:52:35,873
<i>So, who is Riley North?</i>

607
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:38,476
<i>Looking to social media,
theories abound.</i>

608
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:39,877
<i>One possible link,</i>

609
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:41,445
<i>Riley North's husband
and daughter</i>

610
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:44,482
<i>were gunned down in a drive-by
shooting, five years ago.</i>

611
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:48,653
<i>There is a storm of online
speculation about a connection.</i>

612
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:51,789
Folks, I'm gonna need
you behind the tape, thank you.

613
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:53,658
Thirty-four, Asian, male.

614
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,159
- Yeah, yo. Check it out.
- Roughly...

615
00:52:56,161 --> 00:52:59,997
Well, I got a dozen witnesses who
suddenly went blind and didn't see shit.

616
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:01,932
So we got that
going for us.

617
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:04,334
What the hell are the Koreans
doing, slumming it with Garcia?

618
00:53:04,336 --> 00:53:05,903
Money laundering.

619
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:08,271
Garcia's using their infrastructure
to launder his cash.

620
00:53:08,273 --> 00:53:09,940
These fuckers ain't
gonna be happy.

621
00:53:09,942 --> 00:53:12,422
It's gonna get a whole lot worse
if we don't get ahead of this.

622
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,580
We got every black
and white in this city looking,

623
00:53:17,582 --> 00:53:19,950
every camera. Her face
is all over the news.

624
00:53:19,952 --> 00:53:21,751
Well, she knows
what she's doing.

625
00:53:21,753 --> 00:53:24,754
It's turning into a typical
social media shit storm.

626
00:53:24,756 --> 00:53:26,491
Garcia's gonna love
all this attention.

627
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,361
Hey, man.

628
00:53:31,931 --> 00:53:34,633
There's, uh, something I
want you to take a look at.

629
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:36,169
Over here.

630
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:39,105
Stand back, thank you.

631
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,973
Well, this is
a hard sell.

632
00:53:43,975 --> 00:53:46,276
You honestly think that
Riley North did this?

633
00:53:46,278 --> 00:53:48,179
Well, your Fed girlfriend
thinks so.

634
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:50,880
- My what?
- Stan, my man,

635
00:53:50,882 --> 00:53:53,850
you gotta focus on the task at hand.
It's embarrassing.

636
00:53:53,852 --> 00:53:56,319
The only interest I have in
Agent Inman is professional.

637
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,054
- If you say so.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

638
00:53:58,056 --> 00:54:00,623
All right, I'll hit up Gang Narcotics
and see if they have any intel

639
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,325
on suspected
Garcia locations.

640
00:54:02,327 --> 00:54:04,293
Get a list,
set up some Code 5s,

641
00:54:04,295 --> 00:54:05,831
do surveillance
and see if she shows.

642
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:10,166
You be careful who you ask
those kind of questions to.

643
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:12,802
- Fuck's sake. Here we go again.
- Oh, hey.

644
00:54:12,804 --> 00:54:15,905
It only takes a few guys
in the right places.

645
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:17,475
Watch your ass
is all I'm saying.

646
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,309
And you say hi
to Bigfoot for me.

647
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:21,878
What, lover's quarrel?

648
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,980
What about Bigfoot?

649
00:54:23,982 --> 00:54:28,051
Yeah, we were debating who gets to
be impressed by your FBI prowess.

650
00:54:28,053 --> 00:54:29,054
I won.

651
00:54:30,155 --> 00:54:32,155
So what are you thinking?

652
00:54:32,157 --> 00:54:34,723
Riley North arrived in LA
almost three months ago.

653
00:54:34,725 --> 00:54:37,165
Aren't you guys a little curious
where she's been hanging out?

654
00:54:37,996 --> 00:54:39,716
You have a crime analysis
department, right?

655
00:54:40,698 --> 00:54:42,500
Yeah, come with me,
I'll take you there.

656
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:07,725
Cartel up our ass.
And now the Korean Mob?

657
00:55:08,592 --> 00:55:09,894
What's she gonna hit next?

658
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:14,463
Bet Marvin told her
about the lab.

659
00:55:14,465 --> 00:55:16,365
- That would be my bet.
- Fine.

660
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:18,927
Then we send everybody there and
just kill her when she shows up.

661
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:27,945
Boss.

662
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,984
How'd she know
about Marvin?

663
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:39,990
The one guy who happened
to know everything.

664
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,261
And she doesn't kill him.

665
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:46,964
How did she know?

666
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:50,398
She must have been watching us.

667
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,465
Oh, you think?

668
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,839
Those missing shipments,
it was her.

669
00:55:55,973 --> 00:55:57,640
She's been stirring shit up,

670
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:01,009
finding out the moving pieces.

671
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:03,247
Bitch has been
fucking with us for weeks.

672
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:06,148
If that's the case,

673
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,084
then maybe she's expecting us
to send everybody to the lab.

674
00:56:09,086 --> 00:56:11,320
That dance is over.

675
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:13,754
Bitch wanna have
the motherfucking lab,

676
00:56:13,756 --> 00:56:15,358
I will give her
the motherfucking lab.

677
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,684
The system tracks reported
crime in real time.

678
00:57:17,686 --> 00:57:19,753
From that data, we determine
where to send our resources.

679
00:57:19,755 --> 00:57:21,090
Stop problems from spreading.

680
00:57:21,657 --> 00:57:22,889
Any anomalies?

681
00:57:22,891 --> 00:57:25,159
Areas of higher violent crime
than expected?

682
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:26,693
Besides tonight?

683
00:57:26,695 --> 00:57:29,562
Going back a few weeks, are
there any areas that stand out?

684
00:57:29,564 --> 00:57:31,765
This can't predict
where she'll turn up next.

685
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:33,600
It might tell me
where she's been.

686
00:57:33,602 --> 00:57:36,103
Everywhere she goes, people get dead.
She has to be living somewhere.

687
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:38,071
Maybe I can locate
where she's been staying,

688
00:57:38,073 --> 00:57:39,741
her base of operations.
Find her that way.

689
00:57:50,286 --> 00:57:51,918
Nothing.

690
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,888
No sector or neighborhood
stands out.

691
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:57,059
No abnormal spike
in crimes anywhere.

692
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:00,929
It was a good idea.
I was impressed.

693
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:03,396
Really.

694
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:05,198
Oh, you wanna see something
really interesting?

695
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,869
I was looking at this
before you got here.

696
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:12,605
Social media is lit up
with support for her.

697
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,741
She's a multiple
homicide suspect.

698
00:58:14,743 --> 00:58:16,876
Well, not to them she's not.

699
00:58:16,878 --> 00:58:19,624
Now that people know what she's been
through, they're rooting for her.

700
00:58:19,648 --> 00:58:20,648
Look.

701
00:58:23,885 --> 00:58:25,986
Zoom in.
There. What's that?

702
00:58:25,988 --> 00:58:27,619
Skid Row?

703
00:58:27,621 --> 00:58:29,422
Why does it look
safer than Bel-Air?

704
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:31,724
Hmm. That's odd.

705
00:58:31,726 --> 00:58:33,592
Has it
always been like that?

706
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,662
You keep the data,
right?

707
00:58:36,564 --> 00:58:37,884
Can you
give me a minute?

708
00:59:23,512 --> 00:59:24,977
What's going on?

709
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:25,980
You see anything?

710
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:29,016
I don't see nothing.

711
00:59:45,132 --> 00:59:46,733
<i>She's in.
Hit the remote.</i>

712
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:15,093
Uh... Okay,

713
01:00:15,095 --> 01:00:18,031
so the crime pattern started
changing about three months ago.

714
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:22,336
Oh, shit. What's that?

715
01:00:25,238 --> 01:00:28,005
Multiple reports
of an explosion.

716
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:30,342
Fire. Industrial warehouse,
downtown...

717
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:32,411
You stay here.
I'll catch up with you.

718
01:00:32,413 --> 01:00:34,546
- Catch up? Where are you going?
- I got a hunch.

719
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,714
But we didn't talk about
a hunch.

720
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,851
What?

721
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:41,285
Radios are lighting up.

722
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:43,589
- <i>What happened?</i>
- Downtown warehouse just exploded.

723
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:44,689
<i>Is it her again?</i>

724
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:46,290
I'll check it out.

725
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,459
Was it on the list of Garcia
locations you got from Narco?

726
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:50,027
- I don't know.
- <i>What the heck does that mean?</i>

727
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:51,295
<i>Did you get a list or not?</i>

728
01:00:51,297 --> 01:00:53,965
It... I haven't heard back
from them yet, okay?

729
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:55,800
But I'm on it.

730
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:58,436
They're probably just busy,
there's a lot going on right now.

731
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:01,139
Yeah, right. By the way,
Bigfoot says hi.

732
01:01:01,141 --> 01:01:03,941
Oh, come on, Moises, it doesn't
mean anything. They're just...

733
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,601
Hey, are you okay?

734
01:01:29,235 --> 01:01:30,967
Hi.

735
01:01:30,969 --> 01:01:32,170
Hey!
Hey, what the...

736
01:01:32,172 --> 01:01:34,771
Hey! Hey!
Get out of my car!

737
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:36,407
Wait, come on!

738
01:01:36,409 --> 01:01:37,608
Give me my car back!

739
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:12,978
It's them.

740
01:02:13,545 --> 01:02:14,546
They got her.

741
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:21,218
What's the word?

742
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,220
Hey, boss,
we smoked her ass.

743
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:24,621
<i>Are you sure?</i>

744
01:02:24,623 --> 01:02:26,323
She was up in there
when it went up.

745
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,191
There's no way she's
living through that shit.

746
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:29,294
Trust me, she's gone.

747
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,203
You fools are moving up
in the world.

748
01:02:40,205 --> 01:02:41,673
<i>Be calling some shots
pretty soon.</i>

749
01:02:42,407 --> 01:02:43,506
Thank you, boss.

750
01:02:43,508 --> 01:02:44,809
<i>Now get your ass back here.</i>

751
01:02:54,018 --> 01:02:55,320
We'll be calling
some shots!

752
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,088
Whoo!

753
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:16,874
Mm.

754
01:03:25,116 --> 01:03:26,117
That's a cop.

755
01:03:27,018 --> 01:03:28,417
How do you know?

756
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:30,539
Who else would be dumb enough
to bring a new car here?

757
01:03:38,262 --> 01:03:39,263
Hi.

758
01:03:41,065 --> 01:03:42,466
Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

759
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,371
You lost?

760
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,142
I'm looking for someone.

761
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:54,876
Looking for someone.

762
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:56,813
No one's
looking for nobodies.

763
01:03:58,082 --> 01:03:59,916
Isn't it dangerous
at night for the kids?

764
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:03,585
Not anymore.

765
01:04:03,587 --> 01:04:04,588
Why's that?

766
01:04:06,424 --> 01:04:07,824
'Cause we got an angel now.

767
01:04:40,256 --> 01:04:41,790
Is that car following us?

768
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:43,257
What are you talking about?

769
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:50,498
I told you to lay off
that shit, man.

770
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,300
- You're getting paranoid.
- Shut the fuck up.

771
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:56,805
Shit.

772
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:58,339
What the fuck's up
with that guy?

773
01:04:58,341 --> 01:04:59,342
Oh, no.

774
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:24,133
Ah, yeah.

775
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:29,136
Boss,
check it out.

776
01:05:29,138 --> 01:05:32,139
<i>What makes you think
Riley North did this too?</i>

777
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,242
<i>'Cause I saw her jack this
dude's car and just take off.</i>

778
01:05:35,244 --> 01:05:36,546
<i>And she was pissed.</i>

779
01:05:38,013 --> 01:05:41,081
<i>Social media continues
to explode with debate</i>

780
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,920
<i>about female vigilante, Riley
North, still on the loose.</i>

781
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:59,034
It's them. Open it.

782
01:06:56,825 --> 01:06:57,826
Kill the lights.

783
01:06:58,961 --> 01:06:59,962
Stay with the boss.

784
01:08:02,557 --> 01:08:05,658
Don't, please. Please, don't.

785
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,227
I'm not here
to hurt you. Shh.

786
01:08:13,868 --> 01:08:15,670
- He...
- Go.

787
01:09:13,126 --> 01:09:14,126
Fuck.

788
01:09:24,037 --> 01:09:25,972
Don't fucking move!

789
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:31,409
Who the fuck are you?

790
01:09:31,411 --> 01:09:32,445
What do you want?

791
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:34,080
What do I want?

792
01:09:36,148 --> 01:09:37,383
I want justice.

793
01:09:37,984 --> 01:09:38,985
Papa?

794
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:50,162
Come here, baby.
Let's go!

795
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:54,734
Boss?

796
01:10:01,808 --> 01:10:02,809
Boss?

797
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,676
Boss?

798
01:10:05,678 --> 01:10:07,979
Where is she? Where is she?

799
01:10:07,981 --> 01:10:11,415
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It's okay.

800
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:13,283
<i>Jefe,</i> we gotta go.
We gotta go now!

801
01:10:13,285 --> 01:10:14,351
We gotta go now!

802
01:11:07,072 --> 01:11:08,370
Riley?

803
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:11,642
Good evening, Peg.

804
01:11:57,922 --> 01:11:59,588
I remembered the address.

805
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,091
Sorry, we missed
the party last time.

806
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:05,027
Riley,
you're fucking crazy.

807
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,198
Everything they said
about you is true.

808
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,068
You know,

809
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:13,869
I couldn't help but notice,

810
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,974
you're not wearing a ring
on that finger anymore.

811
01:12:18,609 --> 01:12:20,410
He left you, didn't he?

812
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:24,079
For someone younger,
prettier.

813
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:25,650
Go fuck yourself.

814
01:12:29,586 --> 01:12:30,587
Oops.

815
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,758
Yes, he...

816
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:36,726
He left, okay?
You're right, I...

817
01:12:37,795 --> 01:12:39,061
Please.

818
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,263
This is... This is
not gonna bring her back.

819
01:12:41,265 --> 01:12:43,232
I... I'm very sorry
that Carly and...

820
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,566
Don't say my daughter's name.

821
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:46,237
Okay.
I won't. I...

822
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,738
You're gonna get
locked away.

823
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,607
You're gonna go to jail
for a very long time.

824
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:54,310
They...
They will catch you.

825
01:12:54,312 --> 01:12:56,913
This is not... You don't
wanna be doing this.

826
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:02,851
- Thank you.
- I'm going to

827
01:13:02,853 --> 01:13:04,988
burn your house down now,
Peg,

828
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:07,258
with you inside of it.

829
01:13:08,024 --> 01:13:09,125
Oh, good.

830
01:13:09,926 --> 01:13:11,293
Riley.

831
01:13:11,295 --> 01:13:13,428
Riley! Get back here, Riley!

832
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,630
- No!
- Stop squealing, Peg.

833
01:13:15,632 --> 01:13:17,198
- I'm just kidding.
- Riley!

834
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,466
No!

835
01:13:18,468 --> 01:13:19,469
No!

836
01:13:19,803 --> 01:13:20,935
Riley!

837
01:13:40,156 --> 01:13:41,388
Moises.

838
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:43,059
- Got that info you wanted.
- Shoot.

839
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:48,863
All right, this place is owned by
an overseas company out of Belize.

840
01:13:48,865 --> 01:13:50,231
So, any number
of assholes can be...

841
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:51,665
This is Diego Garcia's house.

842
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:52,867
Hey, I'm just saying.

843
01:13:52,869 --> 01:13:54,302
Hey, you seen Carmichael
anywhere?

844
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,337
I can't get him
on the phone.

845
01:13:56,339 --> 01:13:57,706
Ain't my turn
to watch that baby.

846
01:13:59,408 --> 01:14:01,009
Hey, asshole.

847
01:14:01,011 --> 01:14:02,377
If you see him,
tell him to call me.

848
01:14:02,379 --> 01:14:04,345
- Getting a little worried about him.
- Roger that.

849
01:14:04,347 --> 01:14:05,382
Hey, Barker.

850
01:14:05,848 --> 01:14:07,215
Barker.

851
01:14:07,217 --> 01:14:09,150
What the fuck's going on
in Narcotics?

852
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:11,386
Carmichael's been trying to get
a list of Garcia locations

853
01:14:11,388 --> 01:14:13,187
from you guys
and he gets blown off?

854
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:15,390
You got somebody trying to
protect that motherfucker?

855
01:14:15,392 --> 01:14:17,325
- Hold on, Moises...
- No, no. Don't "Moises" me.

856
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,595
I've been trying to call
Carmichael all goddamn night.

857
01:14:21,264 --> 01:14:22,562
- What?
- Yeah.

858
01:14:22,564 --> 01:14:24,531
Calls, texts, emails.

859
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:26,566
Even went by his desk twice.

860
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:29,670
We've been trying to coordinate
with him since this thing started.

861
01:14:29,672 --> 01:14:31,112
Who told you
we didn't call him back?

862
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:34,411
He did.

863
01:14:48,557 --> 01:14:50,357
I think
there's another cop.

864
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:52,859
Where's your backup?
What took you so long?

865
01:14:52,861 --> 01:14:54,861
Sorry, they're
a little behind.

866
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:55,864
What do you got?

867
01:14:56,598 --> 01:14:57,766
I snooped around
a little.

868
01:14:59,401 --> 01:15:00,402
Look what I found.

869
01:15:01,737 --> 01:15:03,270
Damn.

870
01:15:03,272 --> 01:15:04,905
The van wasn't even locked.

871
01:15:04,907 --> 01:15:07,074
You'd have to be insane to leave
a vehicle in this neighborhood.

872
01:15:07,076 --> 01:15:09,443
But unlocked, with an
arsenal in the back?

873
01:15:09,445 --> 01:15:11,005
People are too afraid
to steal from her.

874
01:15:12,747 --> 01:15:14,083
I don't think it's fear,
Stan.

875
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,087
It's not some software glitch
that makes this area low crime.

876
01:15:20,089 --> 01:15:22,389
It is low crime
because of her.

877
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:24,458
So how do you wanna play it?

878
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:27,260
Set up surveillance, apprehend
her when she returns.

879
01:15:27,262 --> 01:15:29,463
- We can take her alive.
- Alive?

880
01:15:29,465 --> 01:15:32,498
She's obviously been watching
Garcia's operation for weeks.

881
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,000
God only knows
what she's figured out.

882
01:15:34,002 --> 01:15:36,802
We get her to talk, we take
down him, his suppliers,

883
01:15:36,804 --> 01:15:38,140
everything and everybody.

884
01:15:39,107 --> 01:15:40,340
If the rumors are true,

885
01:15:40,342 --> 01:15:42,775
Garcia has someone tipping
him from the inside.

886
01:15:42,777 --> 01:15:44,744
And she's gotten closer
than we ever will.

887
01:15:44,746 --> 01:15:46,078
I'm gonna head back
to the office,

888
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,080
I'll coordinate
the inter-agency, FBI,

889
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:51,117
DEA, LAPD,
and Internal Affairs.

890
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:53,519
Hey, Inman, I have to
tell you something.

891
01:15:53,521 --> 01:15:55,857
- Yeah, what?
- I'm sorry.

892
01:16:25,685 --> 01:16:27,119
I know where to find her.

893
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:28,354
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

894
01:16:28,356 --> 01:16:29,788
You gather your crew.

895
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:31,710
Tell those fuckers it's
time to earn their money.

896
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,727
I don't care if we have
to burn the city down.

897
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:37,899
But this shit ends tonight.
Understood?

898
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:16,201
Let's get
these motherfuckers.

899
01:17:16,203 --> 01:17:17,602
I got someone
in the 911 center.

900
01:17:17,604 --> 01:17:19,871
Any calls from this area
will route through him.

901
01:17:19,873 --> 01:17:21,074
We gotta to do this fast.

902
01:17:23,443 --> 01:17:25,176
Is this smart?

903
01:17:25,178 --> 01:17:27,578
We're announcing ourselves. I
don't know that she's here yet.

904
01:17:27,714 --> 01:17:29,080
If she's here,

905
01:17:29,082 --> 01:17:30,083
we'll find her.

906
01:17:31,051 --> 01:17:32,052
All right, let's go.

907
01:17:41,027 --> 01:17:42,187
- Hey!
- Get up!

908
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:45,432
Get out of here.

909
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:54,207
Check over there.

910
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:48,427
Mom.

911
01:18:53,098 --> 01:18:54,798
Mom.

912
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,633
You have to wake up, now.

913
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,214
We got something here.

914
01:19:10,216 --> 01:19:11,982
<i>Warehouse,
west of the alley.</i>

915
01:19:11,984 --> 01:19:13,152
Whoa, whoa, come on.

916
01:19:50,589 --> 01:19:52,389
<i>Talk to me, guys,
what's going on?</i>

917
01:19:55,093 --> 01:19:56,194
<i>Did you find her?</i>

918
01:19:57,328 --> 01:19:58,997
<i>Maybe. Going in now.</i>

919
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,451
Holy shit.

920
01:20:21,519 --> 01:20:22,520
Man down.

921
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:58,279
<i>Cortez, we heard gunshots.
Did you get her?</i>

922
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:00,325
<i>Cortez.</i>

923
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:12,501
Listen to me.

924
01:21:12,503 --> 01:21:14,102
<i>Get outta here.</i>

925
01:21:14,104 --> 01:21:16,237
<i>Leave these people alone.</i>

926
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,441
<i>Just give me Garcia and go.</i>

927
01:21:19,443 --> 01:21:21,843
Or so help me God,
I will kill every

928
01:21:21,845 --> 01:21:23,411
<i>single one of you.</i>

929
01:21:23,413 --> 01:21:24,579
<i>Your choice.</i>

930
01:21:24,581 --> 01:21:25,615
She's bluffing!

931
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:35,492
I can hear the pain
in your voice.

932
01:21:37,127 --> 01:21:38,128
<i>You're hurting.</i>

933
01:21:39,096 --> 01:21:40,330
<i>You're hurting bad.</i>

934
01:21:41,498 --> 01:21:43,665
<i>Out-manned, out-gunned.</i>

935
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,435
How you really think
this is gonna go?

936
01:21:50,674 --> 01:21:53,174
I'm gonna shoot you
in your fucking face.

937
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:55,312
<i>And then I'll pretty much
figure it out from there.</i>

938
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:56,979
I'll see you soon.

939
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:14,361
<i>You've
reached Special Agent Lisa Inman.</i>

940
01:22:14,731 --> 01:22:16,466
- She's not answering me, either.
- Shit.

941
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:18,633
We gotta find her.

942
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:21,034
See if we can get a location
on Inman's cell phone.

943
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:24,138
- Find out where it last pinged a tower.
- Yeah, already ahead of you.

944
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,642
Hi, this is
Special Agent Li.

945
01:22:26,476 --> 01:22:28,075
I need
a cell phone location.

946
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:29,811
- This is Barker, Narcotics.
- Special Agent Lisa Inman.

947
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:32,012
I need a stingray van
immediately, Los Angeles area.

948
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:35,550
- 323 555-9357.
- What? Yeah, yeah, right now.

949
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:08,382
Where's the remote?

950
01:23:08,384 --> 01:23:09,683
Where's the remote for the TV?

951
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:10,805
- Where's the remote?
- Here.

952
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:15,055
<i>- ...prove it to you right now.</i>
- Moises, we got the van.

953
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:16,125
<i>Look.</i>

954
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:19,091
Okay.

955
01:23:19,093 --> 01:23:20,194
You see,

956
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:22,463
<i>that guy is a dirty cop.</i>

957
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:23,532
Motherfucker.

958
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:26,700
<i>That scumbag right there,</i>

959
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,302
<i>that is Diego Garcia.</i>

960
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,806
He is the man who killed
my entire family.

961
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:36,710
<i>If you have a news crew,
come on down,</i>

962
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:38,579
<i>and if you have a cell phone</i>

963
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:40,481
<i>and you wanna come and
take videos, come on down.</i>

964
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:42,050
<i>And if you are the LAPD,</i>

965
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:45,552
<i>this is where the party is.</i>

966
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:48,087
<i>I'm not going anywhere.
Come and get me.</i>

967
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,790
<i>I'm Riley North.
I'm in Skid Row,</i>

968
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:52,325
<i>I'm on the corner
of Olympic and San Julian.</i>

969
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:53,760
- We got a location!
<i>- Riley?</i>

970
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,096
Let's go! Let's go!

971
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,833
Let me go! No!

972
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,801
- Stop.
- Hey.

973
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:02,905
Come on, man.
He's just a kid.

974
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,275
You're in this.
You've always been in this.

975
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:08,911
You want out,

976
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:10,411
just nod.

977
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:15,149
No, you're right. I'm in.

978
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:20,853
Maria!

979
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:23,091
Hey,
soon-to-be dead bitch,

980
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:25,191
<i>you hear me?</i>

981
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:27,360
I've got someone here
I want you to meet.

982
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,530
Say your name, sweetheart.

983
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:32,798
Tell her your name.

984
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,136
My name is Maria.

985
01:24:37,104 --> 01:24:38,170
<i>Maria, here,</i>

986
01:24:38,172 --> 01:24:41,007
she's about to die
because of you.

987
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:44,877
Damn. You just don't seem to have
any luck with little girls, do you?

988
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,053
No! Stop!

989
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:55,302
I'm gonna count to five.

990
01:24:57,124 --> 01:24:58,724
Then I'm gonna blow
her fucking head off.

991
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:01,462
One...

992
01:25:02,463 --> 01:25:03,464
No!

993
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:05,533
Two...

994
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:10,502
Maria.

995
01:25:10,504 --> 01:25:11,538
Three...

996
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:16,010
<i>Four...</i>

997
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,178
I'm coming. I'm coming.

998
01:25:19,546 --> 01:25:21,212
SWAT team is
ten minutes behind us.

999
01:25:21,214 --> 01:25:22,583
Forget it.
We're not waiting.

1000
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:39,698
Drop the gun!

1001
01:25:58,452 --> 01:25:59,851
Are you okay?

1002
01:25:59,853 --> 01:26:01,219
I knew you'd save me.

1003
01:26:01,221 --> 01:26:02,387
I knew it.

1004
01:26:02,389 --> 01:26:03,888
You were right.

1005
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:05,025
Here I am.

1006
01:26:06,426 --> 01:26:07,427
Let her go.

1007
01:26:18,038 --> 01:26:19,771
You have to go now,
Maria.

1008
01:26:19,773 --> 01:26:21,072
You have to come
with me.

1009
01:26:21,074 --> 01:26:22,439
- I can't. I wish I could.
- No!

1010
01:26:22,441 --> 01:26:24,809
- Get her outta here. Come on.
- Just go. Get safe.

1011
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:26,443
No! Please!

1012
01:26:26,445 --> 01:26:29,047
No! No, get off me!
Please!

1013
01:26:29,049 --> 01:26:30,117
Get off me!

1014
01:26:30,917 --> 01:26:31,918
No!

1015
01:26:32,418 --> 01:26:34,121
Stop. Stop.

1016
01:26:42,796 --> 01:26:44,064
Are you scared of me?

1017
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:58,577
Is this where you have one
of your flunkies shoot me?

1018
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:00,744
Coward.

1019
01:27:00,746 --> 01:27:02,846
You don't wanna get
your hand dirty, huh?

1020
01:27:05,584 --> 01:27:06,585
Get her up.

1021
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:17,695
- I'm waiting.
- We gotta get outta here.

1022
01:27:17,697 --> 01:27:19,129
She's toying with you.
Stalling.

1023
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:20,798
- Just get it over with.
- Shut the fuck up!

1024
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,101
Let me have a little fun here.

1025
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:27,106
No!

1026
01:27:31,677 --> 01:27:33,378
You hit like a girl.

1027
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:39,384
Oh, Jesus.

1028
01:27:40,519 --> 01:27:43,155
You see that?
She ain't toying with shit.

1029
01:27:48,694 --> 01:27:51,561
I must say that
I'm a bit disappointed.

1030
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:53,529
I thought you were
gonna put on a real fight.

1031
01:27:53,531 --> 01:27:54,632
Make it fun for me.

1032
01:27:57,702 --> 01:27:58,838
You wanna hear a secret?

1033
01:28:03,175 --> 01:28:04,908
You should've
listened to Carmichael.

1034
01:28:10,381 --> 01:28:12,916
<i>LAPD.
Stay where you are.</i>

1035
01:28:12,918 --> 01:28:14,385
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

1036
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:17,355
Police!

1037
01:28:21,093 --> 01:28:22,094
Police!

1038
01:28:23,862 --> 01:28:25,162
Police!

1039
01:28:25,164 --> 01:28:26,364
- You sold me, <i>puto.</i>
- No!

1040
01:28:36,274 --> 01:28:38,541
Uh, you guys can't
go through here. Stay back.

1041
01:28:38,543 --> 01:28:39,544
Yo, hey!

1042
01:28:44,549 --> 01:28:45,550
Move! Move!

1043
01:29:08,605 --> 01:29:09,941
Out of my fucking way!

1044
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,323
Riley North!

1045
01:29:28,325 --> 01:29:30,759
Step back! We got him.

1046
01:29:30,761 --> 01:29:32,661
We'll take care of it.

1047
01:29:32,663 --> 01:29:34,563
Like you did last time?

1048
01:29:34,565 --> 01:29:36,398
No, he ain't getting away.

1049
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,001
Just drop the gun.

1050
01:29:41,738 --> 01:29:43,139
Riley!

1051
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:44,275
On the ground!

1052
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:47,778
Don't do it.
I'm begging you.

1053
01:29:51,081 --> 01:29:52,848
Please, Riley.

1054
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:54,516
You're a crazy ass.

1055
01:29:54,518 --> 01:29:57,688
You'll spend more time
in prison than me.

1056
01:30:00,123 --> 01:30:01,825
We're not going to prison.

1057
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:09,365
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1058
01:30:10,267 --> 01:30:11,268
Fuck!

1059
01:30:25,949 --> 01:30:27,050
Where the hell is she?

1060
01:30:38,561 --> 01:30:41,365
Airship, Airship, what do you see?
You got eyes on anything?

1061
01:30:42,698 --> 01:30:45,501
<i>Negative. Negative.
We lost visual.</i>

1062
01:30:48,305 --> 01:30:49,703
Total clusterfuck.

1063
01:30:49,705 --> 01:30:51,805
She could be anywhere.

1064
01:30:51,807 --> 01:30:53,687
We're setting a perimeter
ten blocks out, but...

1065
01:30:54,144 --> 01:30:55,310
Who knows?

1066
01:30:55,312 --> 01:30:56,832
Don't bother.
I know where she's going.

1067
01:31:46,429 --> 01:31:47,696
I've missed you.

1068
01:31:48,764 --> 01:31:50,299
I've missed you so much.

1069
01:31:51,233 --> 01:31:52,802
I miss you so much.

1070
01:32:04,213 --> 01:32:05,214
Riley.

1071
01:32:06,983 --> 01:32:08,217
My husband.

1072
01:32:08,783 --> 01:32:09,918
My daughter.

1073
01:32:12,654 --> 01:32:14,123
They're waiting for me.

1074
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:16,990
Please, just let me die.

1075
01:32:16,992 --> 01:32:18,227
I can't do that.

1076
01:32:21,397 --> 01:32:23,332
This isn't where
the story ends.

1077
01:32:26,435 --> 01:32:27,769
It is for me.

1078
01:32:40,015 --> 01:32:41,916
Need an RA! Now!

1079
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:01,600
<i>Thank you.
So is Riley North a vigilante,</i>

1080
01:33:01,602 --> 01:33:04,971
<i>folk hero, common criminal,
or all of the above?</i>

1081
01:33:04,973 --> 01:33:09,509
<i>Public opinion seems largely in support
of her, but the law may not agree.</i>

1082
01:33:09,511 --> 01:33:12,879
<i>The LAPD's stance was clarified
just an hour ago</i>

1083
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:15,048
<i>by Chief Matthew Rogers.</i>

1084
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:18,650
<i>The Los Angeles Police
Department's position is clear.</i>

1085
01:33:18,652 --> 01:33:21,354
<i>Riley North will answer
for her actions.</i>

1086
01:33:21,356 --> 01:33:24,457
<i>And she will stand trial
for multiple counts of homicide.</i>

1087
01:33:24,459 --> 01:33:25,859
<i>Questions?</i>

1088
01:33:29,863 --> 01:33:33,166
How you doing? Detective Beltran.
I'll take over for a bit.

1089
01:33:33,168 --> 01:33:34,888
Why don't you grab
yourself a cup of coffee?

1090
01:33:35,035 --> 01:33:36,070
Okay.

1091
01:33:47,348 --> 01:33:48,349
Hi, Riley.

1092
01:33:51,553 --> 01:33:52,554
Remember me?

1093
01:33:55,756 --> 01:33:56,757
How you feeling?

1094
01:34:00,994 --> 01:34:03,897
You killed a lot of
very bad people.

1095
01:34:05,099 --> 01:34:08,435
You took down
a massive drug operation.

1096
01:34:10,204 --> 01:34:13,004
Exposed dirty bastards,

1097
01:34:13,006 --> 01:34:14,408
in my own department.

1098
01:34:17,511 --> 01:34:21,115
There's not a cop I know
that...

1099
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:23,584
Well,

1100
01:34:25,853 --> 01:34:29,890
let's just say, some of us wish
things didn't have to be this way.

1101
01:34:38,932 --> 01:34:39,932
Well...

1102
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:46,140
Hope you get better soon.

1103
01:35:06,127 --> 01:35:11,127

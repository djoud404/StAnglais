1
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:26,776
In The New York Herald,
November 26, year 1911...

2
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,113
...there is an account
of the hanging of three men.

3
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,578
They died for the murder
of Sir Edmund William Godfrey...

4
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,374
...husband, father, pharmacist,
and all-around gentleman resident...

5
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,335
...of Greenberry Hill, London.

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,549
He was murdered by three vagrants
whose motive was simple robbery.

7
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,803
They were identified as Joseph Green...

8
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,972
...Stanley Berry...

9
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,808
...and Daniel Hill.

10
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,481
Green, Berry, Hill.

11
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:11,195
And I would like to think
this was only a matter of chance.

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,202
As reported in the Reno Gazette,
June of 1 983...

13
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,455
...there is the story of a fire...

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,083
...the water that it took
to contain the fire...

15
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,837
...and a scuba diver
named Delmer Darion.

16
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,761
Employee of the Nugget Hotel and Casino,
Reno, Nevada...

17
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,681
...engaged as a blackjack dealer,
well-liked and well-regarded...

18
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,185
...as a physical, recreational,
and sporting sort...

19
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,854
...Delmer's true passion was for the lake.

20
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,701
As reported by the coroner,
Delmer died of a heart attack...

21
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,329
...somewhere between the lake
and the tree...

22
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:05,917
...but most curious side note is the suicide
the next day of Craig Hansen...

23
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,128
...volunteer firefighter,
estranged father of four...

24
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,132
...and a poor tendency to drink.
Mr. Hansen was the pilot of the plane...

25
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,553
...that quite accidentally
lifted Delmer Darion out of the water.

26
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,515
Added to this,
Mr. Hansen's tortured life...

27
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,060
...met before with Delmer Darion
just two nights previous.

28
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,686
All I need is a two.

29
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,397
All you need is a deuce. All right.

30
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,107
That is an eight.

31
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,153
Glad you like my work.
All right. Moment of truth-

32
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,282
The weight of the guilt
and the measure of coincidence so large...

33
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,660
...Craig Hansen took his life.

34
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:48,084
And I am trying to think
this was all only a matter of chance.

35
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,379
The tale told
at a 1 961 awards dinner...

36
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,215
...for the American Association
of Forensic Science...

37
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,635
...by Dr. John Harper,
president of the association...

38
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,096
...began with a simple suicide attempt.

39
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,722
- curiosity.

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,183
Seventeen-year-old Sydney Barringer...

41
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:10,314
...in the city of Los Angeles
on March 23rd, 1 958.

42
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,957
The coroner ruled
that the unsuccessful suicide...

43
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,043
...had suddenly become
a successful homicide.

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,589
To explain,
the suicide was confirmed by a note...

45
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,800
...in the right hip pocket
of Sydney Barringer.

46
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,179
At the same time young Sydney stood
on the ledge of this nine-story building...

47
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,974
...an argument swelled
three stories below.

48
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,979
The neighbors heard, as they usually did,
the arguing of the tenants...

49
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,649
...and it was not uncommon for them
to threaten each other with a shotgun...

50
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,818
...or one of the many handguns
in the house.

51
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,486
I'm gonna put you down!

52
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,156
And when the shotgun
accidentally went off...

53
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,449
You asshole!

54
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,869
Sydney just happened to pass.

55
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,162
What?

56
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,081
Shut the fuck up!

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,668
Added to this,
the two tenants turned out to be...

58
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,503
...Faye and Arthur Barringer...

59
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,673
...Sydney's mother and Sydney's father.

60
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,634
When confronted with the charge...

61
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,346
...which took some figuring out
for the officers on the scene of the crime...

62
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,349
...Faye Barringer swore
she did not know the gun was loaded.

63
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,642
I didn't know.

64
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,062
She always threatens me with the gun,
but I don't keep it loaded.

65
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,481
DETECTIVE:
And you didn't load the gun?

66
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,358
Why would I load the gun?

67
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,610
A boy who lived in the building...

68
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,404
...sometimes a visitor
and friend to Sydney Barringer...

69
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,450
...said that he had seen, six days prior,
the loading of the shotgun.

70
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,202
Ricky, come here a minute.

71
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,704
It seems that all the arguing and fighting...

72
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,874
...and all of the violence
was far too much for Sydney Barringer...

73
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,002
...and knowing his mother
and father's tendency to fight...

74
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,629
...he decided to do something.

75
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,549
He said that he wanted them
to kill each other...

76
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,511
. .. and that's all that they wanted to do,
kill each other. . .

77
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,847
. .. and that he would help them do that
if that's what they wanted.

78
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,726
Sydney Barringer jumps
from the ninth-floor rooftop.

79
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,354
His parents argue three stories below.

80
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,482
Her accidental shotgun blast
hits Sydney in the stomach...

81
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,485
...as he passes
the arguing sixth-floor window.

82
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,613
He is killed instantly,
but continues to fall...

83
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,451
...only to find, five stories below,
a safety net installed three days prior...

84
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,121
...for window washers
that would've broken his fall...

85
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,666
...and saved his life
if not for the hole in his stomach.

86
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,211
So Faye Barringer was charged
with the murder of her son...

87
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,798
...and Sydney Barringer noted
as an accomplice in his own death.

88
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,301
And it is in the humble opinion
of this narrator...

89
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,430
...that this is not
just something that happened.

90
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,183
This cannot be one of those things.

91
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,186
This, please, cannot be that.

92
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,731
And for what I would like to say,
I can't.

93
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,067
This was not just
a matter of chance. Ha, ha.

94
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,071
These strange things happen all the time.

95
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,271
In this big game that we play, life,
it's not what you hope for.

96
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,358
It's not what you deserve.
It's what you take.

97
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,487
I'm Frank T.J. Mackey,
a master of the muffin...

98
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,447

102

...just dripping to wet your dock.

103
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,877
Bottom line? Language:

104
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,464
the magical key to unlocking
the female analytical mindset.

105
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,841
Tap directly into her hopes, her wants...

106
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,845
...her fears, her desires,
and her sweet little panties.

107
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:14,517
Learn how to make that lady "friend"
your sex-starved servant.

108
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,354
Seduce and Destroy produces an instant,
money-back guaranteed...

109
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,523
...trance-like state that will get you...

110
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,690
Hey.

111
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,111
- naughty sauce you want fast.

112
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,612
Hey, how many more times...

113
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,658
...do you need to hear
the all-too-famous line-

114
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,451
So?

115
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,038
- "I just don't feel that way about you"?

116
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,707
DICK For over 30 years,
America has hung out...

117
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,168
...and answered questions
with Jimmy Gator.

118
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,713
An American legend
and a true television icon...

119
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,342
...Jimmy celebrates his 1 2,000th hour
of broadcast this week.

120
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,219
Have I been around that long?

121
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,180
DICK He's a family man
who's been married for over 40 years...

122
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,101
...with two children and one
bouncing baby grandchild on the way.

123
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,812
We've tuned in each day
to see the human interaction...

124
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,731
...between Jimmy
and some very special kids...

125
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,235
...and we hope there's 30 more years
of watching that happen.

126
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,403
I'm Jimmy Gator.

127
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,823
Donald W. Winnicott.
1911. North America. South America.

128
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,409
The answer is four.
The answer is 22. Gravity.

129
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,494
The answer
is The Life of Samuel Johnson.

130
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,499
I don't care
what your last bank statement is.

131
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,252
Let's go.
You should have done that 1 0 minutes ago.

132
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,671
We need more dog food.
RICK: Talk in the car.

133
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,924
- Look, I got a serious audition today.
Are you lonely?

134
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,926
RICK: That one too?
- I need this one.

135
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,386
Well, let me tell you.

136
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,598
RICK: I don't understand why you need
four bags of books to go to school.

137
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,102
There's no reason
for this many backpacks.

138
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,147
- Be ready at 2:00.
- It should be 1:30.

139
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,108
RICK: I told you I got an audition.
I won't be here till 2:00.

140
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,319
Get your stuff. Come on.
Gotta go. Love you.

141
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,612
Love you too.
- Okay.

142
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,073
Donnie, do you have an answer?

143
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,367
I do, Jimmy. Prometheus.

144
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,577
JIMMY:
It is!

145
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,623
Donnie, how does it feel?

146
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,547
It's pretty exciting. Bet you don't get
many people my age getting braces.

147
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,050
You were so cute on that game show.

148
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,928
Bet you can't answer any questions now,
though, huh? Ha, ha!

149
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,222
- So we're all set to go, Donnie.
DONNIE: Good.

150
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,932
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

151
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,226
RECEPTIONIST: Bye.
- You're running around like crazy.

152
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,644
I'm gonna be late for work.

153
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,615
Hey.

154
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,450
It's the Quiz Kid, Donnie Smith.

155
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,245
PH IL:
Hello, hello.

156
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:52,007
- How's today, then?
- Fucking bullshit is what this is.

157
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,635
EARL
Fucking regrets.

158
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:59,139
And we do these things,
move through this life.

159
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,394
I'm gonna need your help, Phil.
You got to help me on something today.

160
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,604
I'll take care. Anything, Earl.

161
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,274
Well, you're his doctor, and that's why.

162
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,693
Tell me something. Tell me something.

163
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,945
He needs more pills.
He needs more- Fuck it.

164
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,364
He needs more pills,
and I need some answers. . .

165
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,199
. .. so I'm coming to see you.

166
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,037
Morning, Linda.

167
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,086
I love you, my darling.

168
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,672
I'll be back in a while, Phil.
I have to do some things. . .

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,550
. .. and I have to see something,
and I'll be back.

170
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,803
Fuck.

171
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,764
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

172
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,851
WOMAN
Press one to hear...

173
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,145
...this person's personal description
of themselves...

174
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,314
...and two to leave a personal message
of your own.

175
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,777
JIM Well, hello.
This is Jim. I work in law enforcement.

176
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,362
I'm an officer for the LAPD...

177
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,740
...and work
out of the North Hollywood district.

178
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,409
I love my job,
and I love to go to the movies.

179
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,745
I try to stay physically fit.
My job demands it.

180
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,747
I'm getting up there, though.

181
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:09,626
I'm 32 years old, and I'm 6'2" tall,
and I weigh about 1 80...

182
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,253
...if that's important to you.

183
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm really interested in meeting
someone special who likes quiet things.

184
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,011
My life is very stressful, and I hope
to have a relationship that is very calm...

185
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,764
...and undemanding and loving...

186
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:26,185
...so if you are this person, please leave me
a message at box number 82.

187
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,936
Thank you.

188
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,612
OFFICER:
So much violence...

189
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,032
. .. but that's the way of the world.
Good luck, as always.

190
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,745
Serve and protect and all that other
blah, blah, blah on the side of the car.

191
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,999
JIM:
Let me tell you something.

192
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,919
This is not an easy job.

193
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:57,299
I get a call on the radio from Dispatch.

194
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,385
It's bad news.

195
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,721
And it stinks.

196
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,311
But this is my job, and I love it...

197
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,648
...because I wanna do well.

198
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,943
In this life and in this world,
I wanna do well...

199
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,362
...and I wanna help people.

200
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,824
And I might get 20 bad calls a day...

201
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,662
. .. but one time I can help someone,
I make a save. . .

202
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,082
. .. I correct a wrong or right a situation.. .

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,168
. .. then I'm a happy cop.

204
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:39,341
And we move through this life,
we should try and do good.

205
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,140
Do good.

206
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,145
And if we can do that. ..

207
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,523
. .. and not hurt anyone else...

208
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,277
. .. well, then. . . .

209
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,040
JIM: Hello?
MARCIE: I turn around, there's something.

210
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,042
- Whoa! Slow down.
- You can't just come in here.

211
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,420
- The door was open.
- You not allowed to come in.

212
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,380
- Calm down.
- I am calm!

213
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,258
I got a call to this apartment,
report of a disturbance.

214
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,010
There's no disturbance.

215
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,472
I got a call of a disturbance.
I wanna see what's going on.

216
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,225
- Yeah, but there's no disturbance.
- Then you got nothing to worry about.

217
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,979
You don't tell me. I know my rights.
Just come right in. You can't just. . . .

218
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,981
All right, ma'am, you wanna test me?

219
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,193
All right? You wanna tell me
about the law book, we can do that.

220
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,404
You push me far enough,
I will take you to jail.

221
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,241
- Okay? Now calm yourself down.
- I am calm!

222
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,578
No. You are not calm.
You're screaming at me.

223
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,497
Do you understand?

224
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,875
I got a call of a disturbance,
and I'm going to check it out.

225
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,169
That is what I'm going to do.

226
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,923
- Are you alone in here?
- I ain't got to answer your questions.

227
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,426
No, you don't,
but I'm gonna ask you one more time.

228
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,763
- Are you alone in here?
- What does it look like?

229
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,141
- There's no one else in here?
- You in here.

230
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,561
Okay. That's true,
but is there anyone else. . .

231
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,730
. .. besides me
and besides you in this house?

232
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,815
- No. I said that already.
- Mm-hm.

233
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,068
- Are you lying to me?
- I live by myself.

234
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,696
That might be true,
but the question I'm asking you, ma'am. . . .

235
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,449
Is there anyone else
in this house right now?

236
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,577
- No.
- Okay.

237
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,454
- What is your name?
- Marcie.

238
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,624
Okay. Marcie,
I'm gonna need you to take a seat here.

239
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,878
- I prefer to stand up.
- Okay. I'm not asking.

240
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,508
- I didn't even do nothing.
- Move, ma'am.

241
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:54,268
Okay. So, like I was saying,
I'm here to check on a disturbance.

242
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,229
Now, some of your neighbors
heard screaming and a loud crash.

243
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,815
- I don't even know no loud crash.
- Okay, what-?

244
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,276
- What was that?
- Nothing.

245
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,654
- Sit back down on the couch.
- I ain't gotta do a goddamn thing.

246
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,656
- What's this bullshit?
- Do not do this.

247
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,326
- Do not do this. Do not slap me, ma'am.
- This is bullshit. This is bullshit.

248
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,789
This is bullshit. For what? For what?
For what? Huh? Tell me for what.

249
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,124
No, tell me for what.

250
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,668
JIM: I asked you to sit on the couch.
MARCIE: This is bullshit.

251
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,463
This is bullshit. This is fucking bullshit.

252
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,841
1 5-L-27, I'm gonna need backup.

253
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,343
What the fuck is this?
It's bullshit, motherfucker!

254
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,930
- I want you to stay right there.
- Fucking bullshit, and you know it!

255
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,641
JIM: Stay right there, Marcie.
- Don't you go in my bedroom!

256
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,520
This is bullshit, motherfucker!
Don't go down the hallway!

257
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,731
Don't go down
my motherfucking hallway!

258
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,024
JIM:
This is the LAPD!

259
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,234
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!

260
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,361
JIM:
Come out now with your hands up!

261
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,282
MARCIE:
What did I tell you? Ain't nobody in there!

262
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,534
Where the fuck you going, motherfucker?

263
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,786
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!

264
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,873
Stay out of my motherfucking closet!
What did I tell you?

265
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,375
- Don't go down my hallway!
- This is the police!

266
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,045
If there is anyone in this closet,
come out...

267
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,881
. .. and show yourself to me now,
with your hands up.

268
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,509
Marcie, do not drag
that couch any further!

269
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,761
Don't do this, ma'am!

270
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,097
There's nobody
in my motherfucking closet!

271
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,558
If I have to open this closet,
you will get shot!

272
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,394
MARCIE: Come back here!
Come back here, motherfucker!

273
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,897
What can't you
goddamn fucking talk to me?

274
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,860
- There's nobody in there! I told you!
JIM: Marcie, quiet down!

275
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,783
MARCIE: This don't make no fucking sense!
This don't make no goddamn sense!

276
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,410
This is bullshit, motherfucker!

277
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,245
Why can't you talk to me?

278
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,832
Whoa! Whoa-ho!

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,085
What the hell is this, Marcie?

280
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,587
That ain't mine.

281
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,757
LINDA: He's dying.
He's fucking dying as we're sitting here.

282
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,217
There's not a fucking...

283
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,427
Jesus, how can you tell me
to calm down?

284
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,931
I can help you through this,
but there's certain things...

285
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,267
. .. you're gonna have to take care of,
and we can go over them...

286
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,229
. .. but I need to know
that you're listening to me, okay?

287
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,440
I'm- I'm in a fucking state.
It's like he's going, and I don't-

288
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,944
Just tell me practical things,
like what the fuck do I do with his body?

289
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,280
What do I do when he dies? What next?
What happens then? What next?

290
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,157
That's what Hospice can take care of.

291
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,201
They'll send over a nurse,
somebody who-

292
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,245
No. Phil. He has Phil now.

293
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,997
- Phil is one of the nurses from the service?
- Yeah.

294
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,668
If you're happy with Phil taking care
of him and helping you, that's fine...

295
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,212
. .. but contact Hospice
to arrange for the body.

296
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,172
You don't understand. It's-

297
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,093
There's more pain than before, and
the fucking morphine pills aren't working. . .

298
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,722
. .. and it's like- The past two days,
he can't really swallow...

299
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,350
. .. and I , um- I don't know
if the pills are going down.

300
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:44,187
I can't see inside his mouth anymore,
and I'm up all night staring at him. . .

301
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,774
. .. and I don't know if the pills
are going down. He moans and he hurts.

302
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,277
We can fix that, because I can give you-

303
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,237
Are you listening?

304
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,699
- Yeah. I'm listening. I'm getting better.
- Do you wanna sit down?

305
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,617
I need to sit down.

306
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,999
Okay, Linda, Earl's not gonna make it.

307
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,794
He's dying. He is.
He's dying very, very rapidly.

308
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,548
The thing here
is to make this experience. . .

309
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,885
. .. as painless
and easy for him as possible.

310
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,678
You understand?

311
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:21,016
Now, Hospice will take care
of all the technical things.

312
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,186
They will help you.
They will take care of the body.

313
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,605
They are who you call when he dies.

314
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,025
There's the number of Hospice.

315
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,489
Okay. Now,
as far as the morphine pills go. . .

316
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,657
. .. there's something else to consider.

317
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:42,537
There's a very strong,
very potent solution of liquid morphine. . .

318
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,624
. .. and it's a little bottle.
It has an eyedropper.

319
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,418
It's easy to get into his mouth
and drop on his tongue...

320
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:52,172
. .. and it will certainly diminish the pain
that he's in.

321
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,427
But you need to realize
that, uh, once you give it to him...

322
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,846
. .. there really is no going back.

323
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,643
It will certainly cure his pain, but he will
drift in and out of consciousness. . .

324
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,896
. .. even worse than he is now, Linda.
I mean...

325
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:13,193
All sign of the recognizable Earl
will pretty much go away.

326
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,033
I- What the fuck can I say to-?
I don't know what to say to that.

327
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,255
I don't want to do this.

328
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,424
Sit here.

329
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,221
I can see the things, you know.

330
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,683
It's getting there, that's the cocksucker.

331
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,895
I see that pen.

332
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,231
I see it. I know it's there.

333
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,316
I reach for it.

334
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,944
No.

335
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,282
No. No goddamn use.

336
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,869
I have a son, you know.

337
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,829
- You do?
- Yeah.

338
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,415
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

339
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,250
I mean...

340
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,003
. .. he's around, but...

341
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:18,550
He's here in town,
but I don't know.

342
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,886
You know. . .

343
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,346
. .. he's a tough one.

344
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,266
Very. . . .

345
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,231
- Got a girlfriend, Phil?
- No.

346
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,650
- Get a girlfriend.
- I'm trying.

347
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,279
Do good things with her.
Share the things.

348
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,240
- All that bullshit is true, you know.
- Yeah.

349
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:46,036
Find a good one, hold on, and all that.

350
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,495
Where's Linda?

351
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,582
She went out. She, uh, said
she went out to run some errands.

352
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,792
- She'll be back.
- Oh.

353
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,961
- She's a good girl.
- Yeah.

354
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:02,510
She's a little nuts. Heh.
But she's a good girl, I think. Yeah.

355
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,096
- She's a little daffy. Yeah.
- Yeah.

356
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,182
She loves you.

357
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,893
Well, maybe.

358
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

359
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,105
She is a good one.

360
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,983
When's the last time
you talked to your son?

361
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,111
I don't know.

362
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,656
Ten.

363
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,702
Maybe ten. . . . Five...

364
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,539
Fuck.

365
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
Fuck.

366
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,963
That's another thing that goes.

367
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,384
- Your memory?
- Time lines, you know?

368
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:48,390
I can remember things,
but not right there.

369
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,183
- You know?
- Yeah.

370
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,435
"Yeah"? What the fuck do you know?

371
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,730
- I've seen it before.
- Oh, other fucking assholes like me?

372
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,733
- Ah, there's no asshole like you.
- Cocksucker.

373
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,738
How come every word you use
is either cocksucker, shit balls, or fuck?

374
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,992
- Do me a personal favor.
- Go fuck myself.

375
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,576
- You got it.
- Ha, ha.

376
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,254
I can't...

377
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,214
I can't hold on to this any longer.

378
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,677
- I'll get another pill. Another morphine pill.
- No. Give me the fucking phone.

379
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:30,056
- Who you gonna call?
- I wanna see this. I, uh-

380
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,434
- Where is he? Do you know?
- Who?

381
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,353
- Jack.
- Is Jack your son?

382
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,025
Do you want to call him on the phone?
I can call him.

383
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,777
I can dial the number
if you can remember the number.

384
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,863
It's not him.

385
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:48,450
It's not him. He's a fucking asshole.

386
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,953
Oh, Phil, come here. This is so boring.

387
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,998
So goddamn.. . . Goddamn. . ..

388
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,126
You know, that dying wish. . .

389
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,796
. .. and all that old man on a bed. . ..

390
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,218
- Wants one thing.
- It's okay.

391
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,846
Find him on a. . . .

392
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,976
Frank.

393
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:21,316
His name is Frank Mackey.

394
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,987
- Frank Mackey?
- Yeah.

395
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,864
That's your son?

396
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,991
Not my name.

397
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,537
Go find. ..

398
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,165
Find Lily.

399
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,420
Give me that. Give me.

400
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,675
Give me- If you give me that...

401
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,513
. .. over there on, uh. . . .

402
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,433
Oh. Fuck. I can't hold on to this.

403
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,185
I got it. I got it.

404
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,770
Yeah.

405
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,439
Ah.

406
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,958
Respect the cock.

407
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,215
And tame the cunt.

408
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,802
Tame it.

409
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,556
Take it on headfirst with the skills
that I will teach you at work...

410
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,059
- ... and say, "No. "
AUDIENCE: No!

411
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,853
- You will not control me. No!
AUDIENCE: No!

412
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,940
- You will not take my soul. No!
AUDIENCE: No!

413
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,734
You will not win this game.

414
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,820
Because it is a game, guys.
You wanna think it's not, huh?

415
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,989
You go back to the schoolyard...

416
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,660
. .. and you have that crush
on big-titted Mary Jane.

417
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,167
Respect the cock.

418
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,883
You are embedding this thought:

419
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,137
- I am the one who's in charge.
Yeah.

420
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,683
- I am the one who says, "Yes. "
AUDIENCE: Yes!

421
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,476
- "No. "
AUDIENCE: No!

422
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,687
- "Now. "
AUDIENCE: Now!

423
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,188
"Here. "

424
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,197
Because it's universal, man.

425
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,950
It is evolutional. It is anthropological.

426
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,370
- It is biological.
Yeah.

427
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,080
It is animal.

428
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,873
We. . .

429
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,377
. .. are. . .

430
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,717
. .. men.

431
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,180
You need to ask yourself
what you can do...

432
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,016
- You Gwenovier?
- Yeah.

433
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,976
I'm Captain Muffy, Frank's assistant.

434
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,729
- This is Doc. We can go in right here.
- Sorry I'm late.

435
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,480
He started about 35 minutes ago.. .

436
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,567
. .. but he's probably
getting all pumped up right now.

437
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:37,155
Look down at the top of the page.
At the top of the page, what does it say?

438
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,492
AUDIENCE: "Get a calendar. "
Right. I cannot stress this enough.

439
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,746
It's a simple item.
It's 99 cents at the corner store.

440
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,708
But if you look into your packs,
reach deep into your packs. . .

441
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:53,338
. .. you will see that I have been
nice enough to include one. See?

442
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,300
Yeah, yeah.
That's just the kind of prick I am.

443
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,553
You're gonna need this calendar.
It doesn't seem like much.

444
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,722
It's a simple item. It is a small item.. .

445
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,142
. .. but it is going to make all
the difference in your world.

446
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,269
You meet a girl, work an A-3 interruption.

447
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,856
Let's say an eight-day waiting period
before next contact.

448
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,108
How are you gonna know
when those eight days are up?

449
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,318
AUDIENCE:
Mark the calendar.

450
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,029
That's right. Mark the calendar.
You're gonna mark that calendar.

451
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,782
You're going to stick with me
and this calendar.

452
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,241
You're gonna set goals.

453
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,120
If you really, really wanna make
that friend something else...

454
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,498
. .. you're gonna have to be tough
on yourself.

455
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,833
You're gonna have to set goals.

456
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,212
Uh, you, sir,
in the, uh, brown short-sleeve shirt.

457
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,464
I can't read your name tag.
What's your name, please?

458
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,809
Hello.
- Hi, uh, is Frank there?

459
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,478
- No, you have the wrong number.
- Um...

460
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,897
I'm sorry. I'm looking for a Frank Mackey.

461
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,149
Yeah, no, there's no Frank here.

462
00:28:55,317 --> 00:29:00,321
Is this, um, 81 8-775-3993?

463
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,157
Yeah. No, you have the wrong number.

464
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,453
Do you know a Jack, by any chance?

465
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,998
Just a regular deal. Loosers and tighters.

466
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,335
- We're all set upstairs.
And then she called me up...

467
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:19,340
. .. and she asked me
for advice about a guy.

468
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,509
- Got everything you need?
- All set, thanks.

469
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,554
Does she know how you feel
about her? Have you discussed that?

470
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,347
Yes. Absolutely.

471
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,474
And what does she say?

472
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,602
She says she doesn't
feel that way about me.

473
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,691
I don't think there's anyone in this room
that doesn't understand that pain...

474
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,527
. .. and I wanna thank you
for sharing that with us.

475
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:45,867
Let me tell you what we're gonna teach
Denise when we set goals, all right?

476
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,244
What I say is, "Denise.

477
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,788
Denise the Piece. "

478
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,791
I mark it down. Oh, I write it up.

479
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,335
And you have been warned...

480
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,005
. .. because I have my lasers. . .

481
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,549
. .. I have my Tasers,
I have my ICBMs. ..

482
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:06,804
. .. I have my bazookas,
I have my jets pointed right at you.

483
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,724
Because me and my brothers,
we like to celebrate...

484
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:14,562
. .. and on the first of May,
we celebrate V-Day.

485
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:22,195
And come June, oh, baby,
it is the lick of my spoon.

486
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,407
Come August, we like to celebrate...

487
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,619
. .. Saint Suck My Big Fat
Fucking Sausage.

488
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,747
I set goals for myself. ..

489
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,374
. .. and when I say
I do not wanna take it anymore. . .

490
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,001
. .. I will not take it anymore.

491
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,087
You think she's your friend, Geoff?
You think she's your friend?

492
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,422
They're not your friends.

493
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,800
Do you really think
she's gonna be there when things go bad?

494
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,721
Huh, guys? When things go wrong,
do you think they're gonna be there for us?

495
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,765
Ho-ho, you think again.

496
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:54,268
Oh, fucking Denise, Denise the Piece...

497
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,939
. .. you are gonna give me
that cherry pie, sweet mama baby.

498
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:07,114
Oh, yeah, but listen up. That is not to say
that we don't all need females as friends.

499
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,993
We're gonna learn later that having
a couple of chick friends lying around.. .

500
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,622
. .. comes in real handy in setting
jealousy traps. We'll get to that later.

501
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,252
Right now, what I want you guys to do
is pull out your blue booklets, page 1 8.

502
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,963
We're going quickly.
We're gonna workshop it later.

503
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,090
Eighteen, blue booklet.

504
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,634
"Form A Tragedy. "

505
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,136
This is simple and clean,
and if done correctly...

506
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,514
. .. can be very, very effective
in getting some bush.

507
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,892
Here we go. You call up
your so-called friend and set a date.

508
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,646
Let's say make it around 7:30.
You call her on the phone.

509
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,546
Hello?

510
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,757
Hi. Uh, is Claudia here?

511
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,843
She's sleeping.

512
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,180
Are you-? Are you her boyfriend?

513
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,183
You're Jimmy Gator, right?

514
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,978
That's right. What's your name?

515
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,896
I'm Ray.

516
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,609
- So are you her boyfriend?
- No, I'm just a friend.

517
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,569
I see.

518
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,573
- Ha, ha, what are you doing here? I mean-
- I'm her father.

519
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,160
Mind if I come in?

520
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,997
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

521
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:52,219
CLAUDIA: What the fuck is this?
JIMMY: It's me, Claudia. It's me.

522
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,181
What do you want?
Why are you here?

523
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,976
I'd like to talk to you.
Uh, your boyfriend let me in. I just-

524
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,228
That's not my boyfriend.

525
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,650
- Wanna call me a slut now or something?
- No, I don't.

526
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,401
What the fuck do you want?

527
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:12,865
- I wanna sit. I wanna talk to you.
- Don't sit down.

528
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,243
I want to, uh- God, I want so many things.

529
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,746
- Maybe we could talk-
- I don't wanna talk to you.

530
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,500
- There's things I have to talk to you about.
- I don't want to talk to you.

531
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,752
That's all right.
It doesn't have to be now.

532
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,962
We can make a date
to set some other time.

533
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,090
I didn't mean to walk in on you like this.

534
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,593
Why are you here?
Why are you doing this? Coming in here?

535
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,930
- You wanna call me a whore?
- No, I- Claudia. . . .

536
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,349
I don't want you to think
I'm that way to you.

537
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,019
- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something.
- Yeah, ha, ha. Yeah, right.

538
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,188
What are you doing here?

539
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,108
What the fuck are you doing
in my house?

540
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,777
Please don't yell, honey.
Just don't go crazy.

541
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:53,614
I'm not crazy!
Don't you tell me that I'm crazy!

542
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:58,160
Claudia, I'm sick. I'm sick, Claudia.

543
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,287
- Fuck you.
- No, no, please, listen to me.

544
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,957
- Fuck you!
- Listen to me right now, Claudia.

545
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,292
I am dying.

546
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,878
I got sick, and then I fell down-

547
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,715
Fuck you! Get the fuck out of my house.

548
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,135
I'm dying. I have cancer, Claudia.

549
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,137
I have cancer.

550
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,889
- And I'm dying very soon.
- Fuck you.

551
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,226
- It's metastasized in my bones.
- Fuck you!

552
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,062
Claudia, it's. ... I'm not lying to you.
This is the truth.

553
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,773
I'm telling you, Claudia,
I'm going to lose.

554
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,234
Get out.

555
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,530
Get out! Get the fuck out of here!

556
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,576
- Get out! Go!
- Your mother would like to hear from you.

557
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,829
Fuck you. Get out!

558
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,208
Get the fuck out of my house now!

559
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,210
Get out!

560
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,180
Keep your body running good.

561
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,182
Prevention is everything.

562
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,059
If you don't maintain it, I'll be fixing it.

563
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,519
Keep fit. Stay healthy.

564
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,355
If your car is running good,
take it to Jiffy Lube...

565
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,690
...and they offer Pennzoil.

566
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,484
Prevention.

567
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,985
It's worth it.

568
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,904
Hey, you don't wanna see me.

569
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,530
AVl:
Don.

570
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,116
Hey, Avi.

571
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,035
Just one sec.

572
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,538
Say goodbye to the
plastered-down look of heavy hairspray...

573
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,373
...and hello to the natural-looking-

574
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,043
- Please.
Don't, Donnie. Don't do this.

575
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,379
This is so fucked, Solomon!
I don't deserve this!

576
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,091
Don't get strong, Donnie.
This is making sense.

577
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,511
This is making a lot of sense.

578
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:42,056
You are not doing the job.
The job I ask you to do.

579
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,266
A job I give you.

580
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,227
Over and over and over.

581
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,355
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna say
"I'm sorry" much more.

582
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,982
I don't have any money, Solomon.
If you fire me-

583
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,319
I pay you. I give you a paycheck.

584
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,780
Your sales suck, Don.

585
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,074
I give. I give.

586
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,701
When I find you,
when I meet you, what?

587
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,745
I put your name up
on a fucking billboard.

588
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,831
I put you in my store. My salesman.

589
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,209
My fucking representation
of Solomon Solomon Electronic.

590
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,503
The Quiz Kid, Donnie Smith,
from the game show.

591
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,756
I lent you my celebrity, my name. Exactly.

592
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:20,386
Oh, fuck you. Fuck you.
I paid you! I paid you!

593
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,723
I gave you a fucking chance, and a chance,
over and over, and you let me down!

594
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,268
I trust you with so much!

595
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,981
Keys to my store. The codes to my locks.
The life and blood of my business.

596
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,942
In return, you smash in 7-Eleven!

597
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,112
And late! Always late! Loans!

598
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,406
The loans for your kitchen
that you never did.

599
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,615
I paid you back!

600
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,243
Two years! Two years later,
and from your paycheck!

601
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,036
I never charged interest.

602
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,330
Solomon, please. Please.

603
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,374
I am so fucked here if you do this.

604
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,295
This is the worst timing.
The worst timing I could ever imagine.

605
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,796
I need to keep working.

606
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,924
I have so many debts, so many things.

607
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,760
I have- I have- I have-
I have my surgery.

608
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,722
- My oral surgery coming.
- What surgery?

609
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,017
Oral surgery. Corrective teeth surgery.

610
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,394
What is that?
- Braces.

611
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,313
You don't need braces.
- Yes, I do.

612
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,398
AVl: Your teeth are straight.
- I need surgery!

613
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,025
I need corrective oral surgery.

614
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,986
Donnie, you got struck by lightning
that time in Tahoe.

615
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,946
I don't think braces is a good idea.

616
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,574
Solomon, just let me
ask you once, please.

617
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,783
Please don't do this.

618
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,620
AVl: How are you paying for the braces?
- I don't know.

619
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,456
Well, that's just incredible.
How much are braces, anyway?

620
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,333
It's, uh... It doesn't matter.

621
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,669
AVl: It's, like, $5000. I've seen it. I know.
- Now you're pissing me off.

622
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,963
This is incredible. This is fucking stupid.

623
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,257
You're paying $5000
for braces you don't need?

624
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,092
- I've been a good worker.
- Don't.

625
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,845
- No need for braces.
- Where are you gonna get the money?

626
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,889
- I don't know.
- You were going to ask me.

627
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,767
- I have been a good worker.
- No need for braces, Donnie.

628
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,352
That is none of your business!

629
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,855
I've been a good and loyal worker for you,
you fucking assholes!

630
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,358
- Hey, fuck you. Watch it, now.
- Give me your keys.

631
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,819
- No, don't-
- Give me your fucking keys!

632
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,041
OFFICER 1:
Identified as Porter Parker, age 59...

633
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,543
. .. better known as the dead guy
in the closet.

634
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,420
Says the building guy,
this is her husband.

635
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,714
DETECTIVE 1:
He comes around, raises some shit...

636
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,549
. .. screaming and yelling something.

637
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,218
There's a son and a kid.

638
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,595
- Her son?
- Her son. That's right. And the kid.

639
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,764
They were here,
and from late last night. . .

640
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,058
. .. and through the morning,
screaming and yelling.

641
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,394
- Where are they?
DETECTIVE 1: They are not to be found.

642
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,438
She's got $600 and a large box
of condoms next to the bed.

643
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,983
- She was real belligerent-
OFFICER 2: Three wedding rings.

644
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,528
Guys coming in and out all day.
This is the building guy talking.

645
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,990
OFFICER 1: Building guy says the son
and the closet guy are always going at it.

646
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,201
DETECTIVE 2: And what is she saying?
OFFICER 1: Not a goddamn thing.

647
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,206
Thanks, Randy. Whoa!

648
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,084
How much you pay me for my help?

649
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,336
It's more complicated than that,
little man.

650
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,131
Put me on the payroll and find out.
Find out what's up.

651
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,050
Okay, you don't just sign up
to be a police officer.

652
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:09,138
- It's about three years of training, okay?
- I'm trained. I'm ready to go.

653
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,683
- You wanna buy some candy to help-?
- No. No, sorry, little man.

654
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,394
You wanna take my statement?
I'll perform for you.

655
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,731
- Gotta get paid, though. Gotta get paid.
- Mm-hm.

656
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,441
Why aren't you in school today?

657
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,402
No school today. My teacher got sick.

658
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,238
Oh, you don't have substitute teachers
where you go to school?

659
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,615
No. So, what did they find out
in there?

660
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,826
JIM:
That is confidential information, little man.

661
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,287
DIXON: Tell me what you know.
I'll tell you what I know.

662
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:34,455
JIM:
No can do.

663
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,167
DIXON: Leave this one to the detectives,
they ain't gonna solve shit.

664
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,794
I can help you.
Make you the man with the plan.

665
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,297
Give you the gift that I flow. Think fast.

666
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,800
- You wanna know who killed that guy?
- Okay. You come here.

667
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,802
DIXON: No.
- Come here.

668
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,055
You wanna disrespect an officer
of the law?

669
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,308
I can help you solve the case.
I can tell you who did it.

670
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,519
Oh, you're a joker, huh?
Telling me jokes?

671
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,565
- I'm a rapper.
- Oh, you're a rapper. Oh, okay.

672
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,984
- You got a record contract?
- Not yet.

673
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,987
Give you a clue for the bust
if you show me some trust.

674
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,822
You ever been to juvenile hall?

675
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,157
I ain't fucking with you!

676
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,160
Hey, watch the mouth. Watch it.

677
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,120
Come on, man, just watch me.

678
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,289
Watch and listen.

679
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,294
Okay.

680
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,467
Presence
With the double-ass-meaning gifts I bestow

681
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,136
With my riff and my flow
But you don't hear me, though

682
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,387
Think fast, catch me, yo

683
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,765
'Cause I throw what I know
With a resonance

684
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,017
For your trouble-ass fiend
In weaning yourself

685
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,519
Off of the back of the shelf

686
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,355
Jackass crackers, body-stackers

687
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,649
Dick-tooting niggers
Masturbating your triggers

688
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:46,819
Hold it, homeboy.
I don't need to hear that word.

689
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,279
Living to get older
With a chip on your shoulder

690
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,783
Except you think you got a grip
'Cause your hip got a holster

691
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:56,495
Ain't no confessor, so, buster,
you better just shut the fuck up

692
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,080
Try to listen and learn

693
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,792
Whoa, cut it, Coolio. I've had enough
of the mouth and the language.

694
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,794
I'm almost done.

695
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,879
Finish it up without the lip.

696
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,174
Check that ego
Come off it, I'm the prophet

697
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,885
The professor
I'm gonna teach you about the Worm

698
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,973
Who eventually turned to catch wreck
With the neck of a long-time oppressor

699
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,184
And he's running from the devil
But the debt is always gaining

700
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,271
And if he's worth being hurt
He's worth bringing pain in

701
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,649
When the sunshine don't work
The good Lord bring the rain in

702
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,652
Now, that shit
will help you solve the case.

703
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,075
Okay. Whatever that meant.

704
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,995
I'm sure it's real helpful, Ice-T.

705
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,747
DIXON:
Did you listen to me?

706
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,000
I was listening to you.

707
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,879
I told you who did it,
and you're not even listening to me.

708
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,881
I'm through playing games.

709
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,176
Be cool. Stay in school, okay?

710
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,427
Get out of the street now.

711
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,264
Move it.

712
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,248
RICK: Come on, let's go.
- You're late, not me.

713
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,417
RICK: You could have been in front.
- I didn't see you from the window.

714
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,003
Well, you- Why didn't you just, uh-?
I don't know.

715
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,257
You could have come in the front.
I don't know. Hurry up.

716
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:18,262
- All right, you ready to keep winning?
- Sure.

717
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,611
RICK:
You okay?

718
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,240
Busted my ankle there.

719
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,077
You gotta have that makeup lady
fix your hair.

720
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,413
Okay.
- Okay? It's really wet.

721
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,374
- There you are. There you are.
- I'm sorry we're late, Cynthia.

722
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,210
- Oh, that's all right.
RICK: We got caught in traffic.

723
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,587
- Your book is okay. How you doing?
- I'm fine.

724
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,799
Yeah? Yeah, you ready to go, go, go?

725
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,176
Know anybody involved
in that Alan Thicke thing?

726
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,429
The Corey Haim thing?
Terrorist in the high school?

727
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,723
- Uh, no.
- Where's Richard and Julia?

728
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,933
Oh, good. Um, they're here. They're fine.

729
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,269
They're in the dressing room,
so we're all set.

730
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,730
- Okay. See you later.
- You go to it, handsome.

731
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,566
- See you.
- Okay, buddy, love you.

732
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,903
- Good luck, Rick.
- Hey, Peter.

733
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,406
Dick, Dick. I'm sorry. Dick.

734
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,743
Fuck.
Can't get that fucking name.

735
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,913
- Who's ready to beat the record?
JULIA'S DAD: That was close.

736
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,292
RICK: It's cats and fucking dogs out there.
- Cats and dogs indeed.

737
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,961
RICK: I've never seen it rain
this bad since last year...

738
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,089
. .. because of La Nina or El Nino
or whatever the shit.

739
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,218
RICK:
Sorry I'm late.

740
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,013
- What was your name again?
- Amy, Mr. Jennings.

741
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,766
DICK:
Call me D.J. You said Amy, right? Listen.

742
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,352
Trust me, you know. But stay focused.

743
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,020
Where's the news department?

744
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,147
CYNTH IA: It's upstairs.
- Have you ever been there?

745
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,732
Oh, sure. Why?

746
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,692
I was wondering
about the weather department.

747
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,944
- Uh-huh.
- I was wonder whether the weather people.. .

748
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,905
. .. have outside meteorological services. . .

749
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,782
. .. or if they have in-house instruments.

750
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,951
Um, I can check on that,
and later we can take a tour.

751
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,620
- Oh, okay.
- Sounds good?

752
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,039
- You asking because it's raining outside?
- I guess.

753
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,458
Uh-huh. What do you do?
Whatever's happening, you look into?

754
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,544
- Something like that?
- I don't know.

755
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:19,007
Ha, ha, you don't know, huh?
Well, it's not a bad way to be.

756
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,301
Interested in everything
that's going around.

757
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,471
Wet- Wet is wet. Just that simple.

758
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,933
Hi, Mary.
- Hi, hon, Stanley.

759
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,905
Production.

760
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,540
Rose is on the phone.
Here are the cards for today.

761
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,917
- Fifteen minutes to go over those cards.
- Sorry.

762
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,086
- Find Paula for me.
- You want her right now?

763
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,338
- Yes, now.
- We're on the air in 20 minutes.

764
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,508
Fucking hell, Mary. Yeah, hi.

765
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:05,011
- Hi, how you doing?
I'm drinking.

766
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,515
- Slowly or quickly?
- As fast as I can.

767
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,101
You come home soon after the show.

768
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,769
I went to see her.

769
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,689
Some fucking asshole answers the door
in his underwear.

770
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,190
He's 50 years old.

771
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,443
There's coke and shit
laid out on the table.

772
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,902
Did she talk to you?

773
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,697
She went crazy.
She went fucking crazy, Rose.

774
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,533
- Did you tell her?
- Oh, I don't know.

775
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,201
I gotta go. I don't have time.

776
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,954
I got a lot more drinking to do
before I go on.

777
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:34,291
- I love you.
- Love you too.

778
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:35,876
Shit.

779
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:40,941
- Hello?
JIM: Police! Open the door!

780
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,359
Who is it?

781
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,196
JIM:
It's the LAPD! Open the door!

782
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,823
CLAUDIA:
I'm coming!

783
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,451
I have to get dressed!

784
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,790
You're not coming fast enough!
Open the door!

785
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:00,752
Didn't you hear me? I said I'm coming,
and that means I'm coming!

786
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,755
I just have to get dressed, all right?

787
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,591
I really- I have to get dressed!

788
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,020
I hate coming here
and not being able to talk.

789
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,439
It's fine. I understand.

790
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,441
I wish the circumstance was better.

791
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,860
I don't know what's gonna happen.
It's so fucked.

792
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:29,906
- I feel so over the top with everything.
- Running out of your medication at all. . .

793
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,325
. .. let alone at a time like this,
could be drastic.

794
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,578
Thank you, Dr. Diane.

795
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,332
- even your pocket.
And the pocket fisherman's-

796
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,501
-7:30 this Saturday night.

797
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:46,923
- dollars and 99 cents.
Hold it, Ron. It's only four easy-

798
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,800
NASDAQ trading at-

799
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,811
- Stanley Spector
and his brilliant friends, Richard and Julia...

800
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:04,065
...can defeat today's adult challengers,
Mim, Luis, and Todd.

801
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,027
They're moving towards
a half-a-million-dollar team total...

802
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,529
...and a What Do Kids Know? record.

803
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,866
Pink Dot.
- Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.

804
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:16,578
- Phone number?
-81 8-725-4424.

805
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,330
- Partridge?
- Yeah.

806
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,581
What would you like?

807
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,125
I'd like to get an order of,
um, peanut butter. . .

808
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,045
- Mm-hm.
- . . .uh, cigarettes, Camel Lights.

809
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,255
- Mm-hm.
- Uh, water...

810
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,967
- Bottled water?
- Um, no. You know what, forget the water.

811
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,846
- Just give me a loaf of bread. White bread.
- Okay.

812
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:40,060
- And, um, do you have Playboy magazine?
- Yeah.

813
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,813
Okay. One of those.
And, uh, Penthouse, the magazine?

814
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,275
- Yeah.
- You have that? Okay. Uh, one of those.

815
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:51,154
- And, um, Hustler?
- Yeah.

816
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,032
- Do you have that?
- Yeah, I said.

817
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,076
- That it?
- Yeah, that's it.

818
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,828
You still want the peanut butter,
bread, and cigarettes?

819
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,498
Yeah. What?

820
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:05,710
- The total is 31 .90. Thirty minutes or less.
- Okay. Thank you.

821
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,171
- Is that cash or credit card?
- Cash.

822
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,256
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

823
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,425
- Bye.
- Bye.

824
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:26,231
Respect the cock and tame the cunt!

825
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,400
Have a great lunch!

826
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,865
This is Gwenovier from Profiles.
She's here for the interview.

827
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,784
- Nice to meet you.
- I admire your work.

828
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:42,539
- Thank you. I have us set up in a suite-
- It's not very safe for you here.

829
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,125
I finish
one of these seminars, Gwenovier.. . .

830
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:49,754
I swear to fucking God.
I mean, I am Batman.

831
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,590
I'm Superman. I'm like a. . .. A fucking. . . .

832
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,927
I'm like a fucking action hero after that.

833
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,263
I could walk out if this room right now.

834
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,682
I could go down the hall,
walk down the street. . .

835
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,310
. .. and pick up any little honey I meet
that has even one second to stop.

836
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,980
GWENOVIER: All it takes is one second?
- Just one second, girl.

837
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,940
One glance, one hesitation...

838
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:13,987
. .. one subtle look my way
for me to know...

839
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,947
. .. and then it is:

840
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,283
Bing, bang, boom.

841
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,994
Oh, my God. Oh!

842
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,579
I'm away on a tangent.

843
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,667
- I tell you...
GWENOVIER: Don't hurt yourself, okay?

844
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,295
I tell you, I do.

845
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,672
I get so fucking jazzed
at these seminars. . .

846
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,050
. .. see, because I am what I believe.

847
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,178
I do as I say.

848
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,973
I live by these rules. . .

849
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,975
. .. as religiously as I preach them.

850
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:47,687
That's why I am getting the nasty left,
right, center, up, down, sideways.

851
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:51,941
The Battle of the Bush is being fought
and won by Team Mackey.

852
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:58,448
- We're gonna start rolling now.
- What? I thought we were rolling.

853
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:03,369
Come on, go, go, go, Gwenovier.
I am firing pearls at you here.

854
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,164
I want you to know that I'm not
succeeding in the bush...

855
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,834
. .. because I'm Frank T.J. Mackey.
Ah, you think about this.

856
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:13,421
I mean, there are women. . .

857
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:17,133
. .. who, uh, wanna destroy me.

858
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,261
No. I find that hard to believe.

859
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,432
It makes it very difficult,
twice as hard for me.

860
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,434
There's some hottie I'm moving in on...

861
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:32,565
. .. knows me, knows my, you know,
my, uh, plans and my schemes, you know?

862
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,275
She's gonna wanna fuck with me.

863
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:37,195
She's gonna go back, you know
tell her friends: Yada, yada, yada...

864
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:40,406
"You know, Frank T.J. Mackey,
he ain't all that. " You know.

865
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,450
"He ain't all that. Didn't get me. "

866
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,285
So, me, I am...

867
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,580
You know, I'm just on full afterburners.. .

868
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,666
- . . .full-throttle through hottie heaven.
- Okay.

869
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,419
- Just dodging left. Dodging right.
- Yes, I understand.

870
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:58,216
- Dodging these bullets from these terrorists.
- I should've known this was gonna happen.

871
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:01,761
Calm down, take it easy,
and be a good boy. ..

872
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,055
. .. okay, Mr. Mackey?

873
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,140
Thank you. Now, you sit back there...

874
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,268
. .. put your microphone on
for me, please. . .

875
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,604
- Yes, ma'am.
- So we can do this thing, all right?

876
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,110
Okay, um.. . .

877
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:24,284
- Okay. Let me start by asking you-
- Just a second. One second.

878
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,790
You missed a button.

879
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,459
Thank you.

880
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,799
What do you wanna know?

881
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:53,479
Make it happen.

882
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,150
This is you, Donnie. Go, go, go.

883
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,947
Hello. You're back again, huh?

884
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,157
Yeah. Yes. Hi.

885
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:49,160
- What can I get you?
- Uh, Diet Coke.

886
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,961
You look tired. You want one of these?

887
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:42,505
Better pour you one of these, huh?

888
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,674
WAITRESS:
Can you ring me up?

889
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,599
Brad, good to see you.
It's good to see you.

890
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,935
You make that down payment
on the Harley yet?

891
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,980
Not yet. Not yet. I'll make it next week.

892
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:04,527
Six days. You'll be the first.

893
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,780
Ha, ha, I would love that.

894
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,283
- Want another one?
- Yes.

895
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,463
Uh, I'd like a tequila.

896
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,340
WAITRESS: What kind?
- It doesn't matter.

897
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,562
JIM:
Open up the door now!

898
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,524
CLAUDIA:
Yes, hi! Hello!

899
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,112
Yeah.

900
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,324
I'm sorry. I had to get dressed.

901
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:55,119
- You the resident here?
- Yes.

902
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,914
- You alone in there?
- Yes.

903
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,458
No one else in there with you?

904
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:04,837
No. What's wrong?

905
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:11,302
First of all, you're gonna have to turn down
the music so we can have a conversation.

906
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,194
You mind if I come in?

907
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,488
No. Go ahead.

908
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,875
You got your neighbors
real worried for you.

909
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,128
I'm sorry.

910
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,921
- You live alone?
- Yes.

911
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,631
- What's your name?
- Claudia.

912
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,384
- Claudia what?
- Wilson.

913
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,095
Okay, Claudia Wilson...

914
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,431
- . . .are you trying to go deaf?
- What? Ha, ha.

915
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,395
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes, but I don't know what.. . .

916
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,731
Okay. You're listening to your music
so loud. ..

917
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:10,403
- . . .you're gonna damage your ears.
- Okay.

918
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,573
If you continue to listen
to your music at that level. . .

919
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:18,035
. .. you're gonna damage not only your ears,
but your neighbors' ears as well.

920
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,080
- I didn't realize it was that loud.
- Yeah.

921
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,458
Well, that right there
is the first sign of hearing loss, okay?

922
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,127
Okay.

923
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,798
I see you got your TV on there too.

924
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:33,134
You usually keep that on
at the same time?

925
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:37,305
I don't know. I mean, um. . . . What is this?

926
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,809
- You been doing some drugs today, Claudia?
- No.

927
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,522
- Have you been doing some drinking?
- No, ha, ha.

928
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,399
Okay.

929
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,779
I got a call of a disturbance here.

930
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:59,827
Some loud music, A,
and some screaming and yelling.

931
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,914
Has there been some screaming
and yelling here?

932
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,708
Yes.

933
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,837
I had someone come to my door.

934
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,465
Someone that I didn't want here.

935
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:18,888
And I told them to leave,
so it's no big deal.

936
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:22,725
They left. I'm sorry.

937
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,311
- Was that your boyfriend?
- No.

938
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,024
- You don't have a boyfriend?
- No.

939
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,486
Well, who was it?

940
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:37,156
I was. . .. He's gone.

941
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:41,077
I mean, it's not- It's over, you know?

942
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,418
You mind if I have a look around
for your safety?

943
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,796
- It's fine.
- Okay.

944
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:55,675
Uh, what-?
What are you looking for?

945
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:00,012
Claudia, why don't you let me
handle the questions. . .

946
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,848
- . . .and you handle the answers, okay?
- Okay.

947
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,851
- I'm here to help you.
- Okay.

948
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,398
- So do you still have to do homework?
- Not as much as I used to.

949
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,775
Since we started,
I haven't gone to school much.

950
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:16,028
- I've had so many auditions.
- I don't have regular classes anymore.

951
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,365
- What do you do?
- They let me have my own study time.

952
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,201
- My own reading time in the library.
- That's pretty cool.

953
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,370
- Do you have an agent, Stanley?
No.

954
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,957
You should get one. I'm serious.
You could get a lot of stuff out of this.

955
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,960
- Like what?
- What do you mean? Endorsements and shit!

956
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,421
- Richard.
- Bite it, Cynthia.

957
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,590
You get stuff from people
that want you to endorse their product.

958
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,468
Commercials, a sitcom,
an M.O.W. or something.

959
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,513
- What's M.O.W.?
- Hello. Movie of the week.

960
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,266
I went for one this morning
with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim.

961
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,269
RICHARD: Was it a callback?
JULIA: No, but I'll probably get a callback.

962
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:50,688
RICHARD: If we beat the record,
you might get a callback.

963
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,024
JULIA: I'll get it
because I'm a good actress, Richard.

964
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,568
RICHARD: Saucy, saucy.
CYNTH IA: Come on, guys. Settle down.

965
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,111
- Cynthia?
- What do you want?

966
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,530
I gotta go to the bathroom.
CYNTH IA: Can you hold it?

967
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,743
Yessiree! Whoa!

968
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,496
That was absolutely fantastic,
and I thank you very much.

969
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:11,125
As a matter of fact, we may even
take you folks on the road with us.

970
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,502
LUIS: That's my thing.
Come on. I'm serious. Come on.

971
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,672
Milk and sports, man.
You never heard-? Milk and sports, okay?

972
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,800
Anything baseball.
Um, anything dealing with numbers. . .

973
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:23,220
. .. when it comes to those, you know,
or who broke whatever record.

974
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:27,141
Any kind of dairy product, any kind-
Dairy recipe...

975
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:30,561
. .. um, like goat milk, goat cheese, goat-
All that stuff.

976
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,438
Wow, check this out over here.

977
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:35,191
So, um, look guys,
just work with me on that. Work with me.

978
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,610
Excuse me,
can you bring me low-fat milk, please?

979
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,987
A couple of ice cubes.

980
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,614
Ah, they don't look so tough.

981
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,866
Do they look smart?
- No.

982
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,827
RICHARD: What are they gonna do, beat us?
Maybe.

983
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,538
We're not going out two days
before we set the record.

984
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,790
It's not gonna happen.

985
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,541
RICHARD:
Yeah. When they want us done...

986
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,461
. .. they'll call in the Harvard SWAT team
or some shit.

987
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:58,464
Ready to run.

988
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,814
You smell like trouble.
- I'm fucking hammered.

989
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,274
- You okay?
- You know.

990
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,402
Good. You have a chance
to look those over?

991
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,155
Oh, come on. It's the same fucking shit
for 30 years, Burt.

992
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,660
You look like you have money
in your pocket.

993
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,374
Maybe I'm just happy to see
my friend Brad there.

994
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,919
DONNIE:
Just throw some money around.

995
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,296
- Money, money, money.
- It's Brad.

996
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:43,175
Ooh. This sounds threatening.

997
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,344
Do you have love in your heart?

998
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,680
I have love all over.

999
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:50,933
I even have love for you, friend.

1000
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,601
- Is it real love?
- Well-

1001
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:56,856
The kind of love that makes you feel
that intangible joy. . .

1002
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,524
. .. in the pit of your stomach...

1003
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,694
. .. like a bucket of acid
and nerves running around...

1004
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:05,948
. .. and making you hurt
and happy and all over. ..?

1005
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,908
You're head over heels?

1006
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,495
You lost me with the last couple
of cocktail words spoken, my boy. . .

1007
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:15,207
. .. but I believe it's that sort of love.

1008
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,127
Sounds nice to me.

1009
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,338
I have love.

1010
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,841
Hmm, a very chatty kind.
Indeed you do, it seems.

1011
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,135
No, I mean, I'm telling you.

1012
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,637
I'm telling you, I have love.

1013
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,224
Yes, and I'm listening avidly, fellow.

1014
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,899
My name is Donnie Smith,
and I have lots of love to give.

1015
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:48,699
- Hello.
- Hi.

1016
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,668
Wow.

1017
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,504
Lot of stuff here, huh?

1018
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,449
It's 30 seconds.

1019
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,078
- eye on you. I'll be back.

1020
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:37,039
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Jakety, Jakety.

1021
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,462
RICHARD:
The fuck is going on over there?

1022
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,299
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Jesus Christ, Stanley.

1023
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:50,803
No, no, no. You cannot do that.
Let me explain something to you people.

1024
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,764
You have to tone it.
Don't be real aggressive like that.

1025
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:56,684
Be subtly abusive
so they don't know what's happening.

1026
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,937
You say, "You're not gonna go outside
and play with your friends. ..

1027
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,481
. .. until that entire room
is cleaned floor to ceiling. "

1028
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,400
Oh, Julia's room's the same way.

1029
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,403
JULIA'S DAD: Like a pigsty.
But it's the outfits we're into now.

1030
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,990
Oh, you should have seen what she had on
walking out the door.

1031
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,576
I said, "No. We're going to school,
not a fashion show. "

1032
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,786
RICHARD'S MOM:
It's not a fashion show. It's school.

1033
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,830
JULIA'S MOM:
Absolutely. It's not a fashion show.

1034
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:19,039
Shh.

1035
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,500
Let's make
some fucking money here, people.

1036
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,586
You with me, Jimmy?

1037
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,005
JIMMY: The book says,
"We may be through with the past...

1038
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,715
. .. but the past ain't through with us. "

1039
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,468
We met upon the level,
and we're parting on the square.

1040
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,054
In my fucking sleep, Burt.

1041
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:41,186
And five, four, three, two. . ..

1042
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:46,859
Live from Burbank, California,
its What Do Kids Know?

1043
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:50,779
Going into our 33rd year on the air,
it's America's longest-running quiz show. ..

1044
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,033
. .. and the place where three kids
get to challenge three adults. . .

1045
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,827
. .. and in the end,
we'll see who's the boss.

1046
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,788
Moving towards their
eighth consecutive week as champions. . .

1047
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,542
...we have the kids:
Richard, Julia, and Stanley.

1048
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,921
And our new adult challengers today
are Mim, Luis, and Todd.

1049
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,049
And me, I'm Dick Jennings...

1050
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:14,428
. .. and now say hello to your favorite host
and my boss...

1051
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,723
. .. Jimmy Gator.

1052
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:28,776
Back again, again, again.
I'm Jimmy Gator, and believe it or not...

1053
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,570
...we are at the end of Week 7,
heading towards Week 8...

1054
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:35,783
...with these three incredible kids, who-
Hello, hello.

1055
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,870
- are just two days and two games away
from the What Do Kids Know? record...

1056
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:43,290
...for the longest-running quiz show
in television history.

1057
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:46,251
Now, we are, as you know,
endorsed by the PTA...

1058
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,420
...and the North American
Teachers' Foundation.

1059
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:52,424
We keep our standards high, and that's why
we are the longest-running quiz show...

1060
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,969
...in television history. I wanna say
something about these kids now.

1061
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,931
These kids right here,
I think they're gonna be here a while.

1062
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,766
But today is a dangerous day...

1063
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,436
...because I have just met
with the adult challengers backstage...

1064
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:08,607
...and let me tell you,
they are a terrific challenge for our kids.

1065
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,819
So let's get this show up and away,
shall we?

1066
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,201
DETECTIVE:
We wanna know where your son is.

1067
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,454
"Jerome Samuel Hall. " Did he fight
your husband? Is this the Worm?

1068
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,457
DETECTIVE: They had a fight. An accident.
OFFICER: They call him Worm?

1069
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,292
DETECTIVE:
We wanna know where your son is.

1070
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,003
- Help us, Marcie.
- Do they call him Worm?

1071
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:33,006
- Help us help your son, Marcie.
OFFICER: Do they call him Worm?

1072
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,883
DETECTIVE:
Help us help your son, Marcie.

1073
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,428
OFFICER: Your son and your grandson.
Help us help them.

1074
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,430
Is this the Worm?

1075
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,474
JIMMY
Let's jump right in.

1076
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,893
A quick recap for those who don't know.

1077
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,439
Round One.
Three categories. Steals are okay.

1078
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:53,610
Point scale escalating from 25 to 250,
one of which is a conversation bonus.

1079
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,620
- Hi.
- That'll be 31 .90.

1080
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:09,501
The categories are "authors,
chaos versus superstring, and rub-a-dub. "

1081
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,424
- Max. Thanks.
- Bye.

1082
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,844
Adults won a coin toss backstage,
so they get to pick first.

1083
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,263
Team captain: Mim.

1084
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,196
First question, for 25.

JIMMY: Stanley?

1088
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,873
Willa Cather for 25.

1089
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,375
Best known for the tragedy-of-blood genre,
this playwright-

1090
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,837
- Stanley.
- Thomas Kyd.

1091
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:55,047
Thomas Kyd.

01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:58,050
This French playwright and actor

1094
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,514
Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna need
a full name, Stanley.

1095
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,600
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.

1096
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,894
What the fuck is this?

1097
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:11,855
God damn. My little fucker.
Ha-ha-ha!

1098
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:15,400
I have no idea where he gets this shit.
He's a fucking genius, really.

1099
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,611
Seduce and Destroy. This is Chad.

1100
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:18,946
Can I have your phone number?

1101
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,949
- Is this Seduce and Destroy?
- Yes, it is. Can I have your phone number?

1102
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,576
Okay, I don't want to order anything.
Uh, you see... .

1103
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:29,206
I have a situation, uh, that's just come up
that's really pretty serious.. .

1104
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:32,167
. .. and I don't know who to talk to
or what I should do. . .

1105
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:35,921
. .. but maybe you could put me in touch
with somebody if I explain myself?

1106
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,590
Uh, we're really only equipped
to take orders here, sir.

1107
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:42,052
I mean, it's just us with the phones,
and that's what we do, you know-

1108
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,515
Okay, okay, okay. Could you connect me
with somebody else, you think?

1109
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:48,267
Well, what's the situation?

1110
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,227
Okay, great, um. . . .

1111
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:53,397
All right. Let me try to explain myself
without it seeming crazy.

1112
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:55,440
But here I go. I'm- No.

1113
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,067
Uh, my name is Phil Parma. . .

1114
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:00,445
. .. and I work for, uh, a man
named Earl Partridge.

1115
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,406
Uh, Mr. Earl Partridge.

1116
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:05,534
I'm his nurse, and he's a very sick man.

1117
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,453
He's a dying man, and he's sick...

1118
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:11,081
. .. and he has asked me to help him.

1119
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:13,792
To help him find his son.

1120
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,881
- Hello? Are you there? Hello?
- No, I'm here. I'm listening.

1121
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,884
Okay. Um, you see...

1122
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,095
. .. Frank T.J. Mackey
is Earl Partridge's son.

1123
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,097
So where are you from originally?

1124
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,849
From around here.
- Valley?

1125
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:32,644
- Well, Hollywood, mainly.
- What did your parents do?

1126
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,439
Uh, my father- Well, he was in television.
My mother-

1127
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,816
- This is going to sound silly to you.
- Try me.

1128
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:41,069
- Uh, she was a librarian.
- Why does that sound silly?

1129
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,196
I don't know. I guess it doesn't.

1130
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,992
- Does your mother still work?
- No, she's retired.

1131
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,870
- Are you close?
- She's my mother.

1132
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:53,749
Yes, but, uh, I mean,
she's a woman too. . .

1133
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,168
. .. so how does she feel
about Seduce and Destroy?

1134
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:57,711
I mean, what does she say?

1135
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,592
Well, she says, uh,
"You go get them, honey. "

1136
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,345
Uh-huh.
And what about your father?

1137
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,306
Oh, my father.
Unfortunately, he passed away.

1138
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:11,642
- Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea.
- No, please.

1139
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,936
I wouldn't have brought that up
if I had known.

1140
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,021
- That's a very hard thing.
- Please.

1141
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,857
Yes, it is, but listen.

1142
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,652
I mean, you have to move forward.
The past has its place.

1143
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:25,530
- It was a long time ago, and people die.
- Yeah.

1144
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,699
Okay, let's switch gears here. Um...

1145
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:33,121
According to your book,
you ended up at UC Berkeley?

1146
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,373
'84 to '89.

1147
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,916
- Psychology major.
- That's right.

1148
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:37,793
- Get your masters?
- Hmm? Oh.

1149
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,878
- This close.
Wow .

1150
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:43,674
- That's impressive in five years.
- Cap, can I have some coffee?

1151
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:44,925
Can I get you anything?

1152
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,386
- No, no, no, I'm good. Thank you.
- You sure? Okay.

1153
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,097
- She's good. I need coffee.
- Ha, ha.

1154
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,893
PHARMACIST:
Cats and dogs out there, huh?

1155
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,983
Must have a lot going on
for all that stuff back there, huh?

1156
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,318
You could, uh...

1157
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,446
Heh. You could have quite a party,
all that stuff.

1158
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:12,786
You been on Prozac long? Dexedrine?

1159
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:15,580
- I don't. . . .
- Interesting drugs.

1160
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,126
Dexedrine's basically speed in a pill,
you know.

1161
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:23,755
I guess a lot of the doctors are balancing
out the Prozac with the Dexedrine, so. . . .

1162
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,925
That liquid morphine
will knock you down, out. . .

1163
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,928
. .. around, up and down,
someone's not careful.

1164
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,766
You can't mix those up, you know.

1165
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,204
Strong, strong stuff here, boy. Wow!

1166
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,790
What you have wrong,
you need all this stuff?

1167
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,001
- Motherfucker.
- What?

1168
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:04,087
- Motherfucker. You fucking asshole.
- What are you talking about?

1169
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,757
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I'm just trying-

1170
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:11,136
I come in here. You don't know me.
You don't know who I am, what my life is. . .

1171
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:14,890
. .. and you have the balls, the indecency
to ask me a question about my life?

1172
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:18,143
- Please, lady, calm down.
- Fuck you too! Don't you call me "lady"!

1173
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,812
I come in here,
I give these things to you.. .

1174
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,939
. .. you check,
you make your phone calls. . .

1175
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,025
. .. look suspicious, ask questions.

1176
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:26,401
I'm sick.

1177
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,489
I have sickness all around me,
and you fucking ask me my life?

1178
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:31,698
"What's wrong?"

1179
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:35,452
Have you seen death in your bed?
In your house?

1180
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:39,164
Where's your fucking decency?
And then I'm asked fucking questions.

1181
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:42,626
"What's wrong?"

1182
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:45,378
You suck my dick, that's what's wrong.

1183
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,256
And you. You fucking call me "lady"?

1184
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,509
Shame on you!

1185
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:55,764
Shame on you. Shame on both of you.

1186
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,309
Why don't they have the same last name?

1187
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,144
Because they don't
have the same last name.

1188
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:05,690
PH IL: I know, and I can't really explain that,
but I think-

1189
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:09,277
I have a feeling there is something,
you know, a situation between them. . .

1190
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,114
. .. like they don't know each other
much or well, you know?

1191
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,574
Something like they don't talk much
anymore, even.

1192
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:15,992
Uh-huh.

1193
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,703
You know? God, does this sound weird?

1194
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,706
Ha, ha. I just don't understand
why you're calling me.

1195
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:25,752
Well, there's no number for Frank
in any of Earl's stuff.. .

1196
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,213
. .. you know, and he's pretty out of it.

1197
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,466
I mean, like I said, he's dying.

1198
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:34,719
Dying of cancer. So...

1199
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,889
- What kind of cancer?
- It's brain and lung.

1200
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,559
- My mother had breast cancer.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1201
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,395
- Is she all right?
- Oh, she's fine now.

1202
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,397
- Oh, that's good.
- It was scary, though.

1203
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,524
- Oh, it's a hell of a disease.
- Oh, it sure is.

1204
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:49,985
- Yeah.
- Well, so, uh...

1205
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:53,280
Wait, I'm sorry. So why call me?

1206
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,825
I know this sounds silly,
and I know that I might sound ridiculous...

1207
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,910
. .. like this is the scene of the movie...

1208
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,955
. .. where the guy is trying to get ahold
of the long-lost son. . .

1209
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,458
. .. you know, but this is that scene.
This is that scene.

1210
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,044
And I think they have
those scenes in movies. . .

1211
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,046
. .. because they're true, you know.

1212
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,007
Because they really happen.

1213
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:16,094
And you gotta believe me,
this is really happening.

1214
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,390
I mean, I can give you my number
and you can go check. . .

1215
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,601
. .. with whoever you gotta check with. . .

1216
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:26,104
. .. but do not leave me hanging on this.

1217
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:31,276
All right? Please. I'm just- Please.

1218
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,778
See. . . .

1219
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:39,034
See, this is, uh, the scene of the movie
where you help me out.

1220
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,077
You're great. These are great questions.

1221
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,663
GWENOVIER: Thank you. Good, good.
- This is going great.

1222
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,957
See, I thought you grew up
here in the Valley.

1223
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,959
Yeah. You know, like I said. Around.

1224
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,920
You went to Van Nuys High, right?

1225
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,255
I wouldn't say I went. I frequented.

1226
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:55,175
I was misguided, pathetic.
Not the Frank T.J. Mackey. . .

1227
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,386
. .. you're so eagerly, uh, wanting
to put on national television.

1228
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,806
Because I was swimming in what was
as opposed to what I wanted.

1229
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,476
- Where does that name come from?
- What name? My name?

1230
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:06,770
Yeah. It's not your given name, right?

1231
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:10,857
It's my mother's name, actually.
That's good. Good. Done your research.

1232
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,818
- And "Frank"?
- Frank is my mother's father.

1233
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,863
Oh, okay. That's why.
See, I had some trouble. . .

1234
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:20,492
. .. locating your school records
at, um, UCLA and, uh, Berkeley.

1235
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,663
And it's your name change.
See, they had no official enrollment for you.

1236
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,915
- No, no, no, they wouldn't.
- They wouldn't?

1237
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,001
No, because I was never
officially enrolled there.

1238
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,670
- Was that unclear?
- Kind of.

1239
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:35,006
Oh. God, I wouldn't want that
to be misunderstood.

1240
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,175
No, uh, my enrollment
was totally unofficial.

1241
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,844
Sadly, I couldn't afford
to pay the tuition up there.

1242
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,348
There were three wonderful professors
who let me to sit in their classes.

1243
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,643
Their names were Macready, Horn,
and Langtree, among others.

1244
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:50,438
You're welcome to call them if you like.
See, I didn't get a free ride. . .

1245
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,526
. .. so, what we're looking at here
is a true rags-to-riches story.

1246
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,153
That's why people respond so strongly
to Seduce. . .

1247
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,156
. .. because at the end of the day,
Seduce may not be just...

1248
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,575
. .. about picking up chicks,
sticking your cock in.

1249
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:06,329
It's about finding out
what you can be in this world...

1250
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:12,335
. .. defining it, controlling it,
and saying, "I will take what is mine. "

1251
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,879
And you happen to get a little blow job
out of it...

1252
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,799
- . . .then, hey, what the fuck? Why not?
- Ha, ha, okay. There you go.

1253
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:22,095
End of Round One.
Excellent work, ladies and germs.

1254
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:24,556
I think we should take a look
at the scores here.

1255
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,349
Kids are up a leg with 1 500...

1256
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:30,061
. .. and the adults are down a little bit
with 1 025.

1257
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,564
So we'll be back for Round Two in a
ring-ding-do.

1258
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:37,319
Whoa, hello, hello.
Bonus musical question.

1259
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,071
And the winner is...

1260
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,326
. .. kids.

1261
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,041
Uh, kids are in the lead. They get a chance
to pull further ahead. . .

1262
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:55,920
. .. if they can answer the following
secret-bonus musical question.

1263
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,631
Now, what I'm going to do
is read a line from an opera.

1264
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,300
Give me that line back. . .

1265
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:02,927
. .. in the language
in which the opera was written. . .

1266
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:07,640
. .. and for a bonus 250- Um, 250-
Uh, 250...

1267
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,101
. .. uh, you can sing it. Heh.

1268
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,771
Here's the line.

1269
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:17,400
"Love is a rebellious bird
that nobody can tame...

1270
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:20,945
. .. and it's all in vain to call it
if it chooses to refuse. "

1271
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:23,782
Yes, Stanley.

1272
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,576
Well, that was in French. . .

1273
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,870
. .. and that was from the opera Carmen...

1274
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,955
. .. and that goes:

1275
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,812
- You got some coffee brewing here.
CLAUDIA: It's not-

1276
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,564
It's been on for a bit.

1277
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,359
Yeah, I like iced coffee, generally. . .

1278
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:03,488
. .. but a day like today, you know,
with the rain and whatnot...

1279
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,865
. .. I enjoy a warm cup.

1280
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,206
Do you want a cup?

1281
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,793
Is that all right?
Just raining cats and dogs out there.

1282
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:20,505
I'd just as soon not go back in it. Heh.

1283
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,550
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be.

1284
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:26,636
Oh, I'm sure it's fine, Claudia.

1285
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:33,393
Do you, um, take cream or sugar?

1286
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,520
That would be fine. Um-

1287
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,732
So, Claudia, let me just say,
so I can get my role as an LAPD officer. ..

1288
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,985
. .. out of the way
before we enjoy our coffee.

1289
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:45,321
I don't like to talk shop over coffee.

1290
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,198
I'm not gonna write you up.

1291
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,826
I'm not gonna give you
a citation here. . .

1292
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:53,663
. .. but the real problem we have here
is that you got people around you...

1293
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:57,667
. .. people who work from home
trying to get some work done...

1294
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:03,506
. .. and if you're listening to your music
that loud, they're inconvenienced by that.

1295
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,801
If you had a job,
you'd probably understand, but...

1296
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:13,266
You like listening to your music.
That's fine. That's fine. Um. . ..

1297
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,227
You're just gonna wanna keep an eye
on the volume level.

1298
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:20,398
You know, maybe memorize
what number you see on the dial.

1299
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,775
If it's the middle of the day,
that's what I do.

1300
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:27,572
I set it at two and a half, and then I know
that's a good listening level for me.

1301
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:32,410
But, uh, you like listening
to your music loud.

1302
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,414
That's fine. That's cool.
It's good to rock out sometimes.

1303
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,208
But you can't do it every day. . .

1304
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,003
. .. or else you risk
damaging your ears. Seriously.

1305
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,425
- You listen to it all the time like that?
- Yeah.

1306
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:51,638
You're gonna drive these people crazy.

1307
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,556
Anyway, you get the point.

1308
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,517
- Yes.
- Okay.

1309
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,018
Um...

1310
01:20:57,937 --> 01:20:59,395
Cheers.

1311
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:13,117
- So this boyfriend bothering you?
- I don't have a boyfriend.

1312
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,704
- The gentleman who was at the door-
- He's not my boyfriend.

1313
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,086
Okay. A lot of times,
in domestic-abuse situations. . .

1314
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:26,214
. .. the young woman
is afraid to speak out.

1315
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,758
You don't have to be afraid
to tell me anything.

1316
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:32,804
And as a police officer, I can tell you. ..

1317
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:35,348
. .. it goes bad places.

1318
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,727
Young woman is afraid,
next thing you know, I'm here on a 1 87.

1319
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,189
It's not- What's a 1 87?

1320
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:47,235
It's not good. And it's where situations
like this always lead.

1321
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,487
It's not my boyfriend,
and it's not anything.

1322
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:53,449
It's over. Really. It's not.
He won't come back.

1323
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:56,703
- I don't wanna have to come back here-
- You won't have to.

1324
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:03,167
You know, I-
I wouldn't mind coming back.

1325
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,087
You know, get a look
at your pretty face again.

1326
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,172
I'll be right back.

1327
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,472
Here you go.

1328
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,808
Let's get the jacket off.
It will help you to breathe.

1329
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,938
I can't fucking do this.

1330
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,277
I've, uh-

1331
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,823
I think- I'm gonna throw up, I think.

1332
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,370
I haven't thrown up
since I was 20 years old.

1333
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,497
Cynthia.

1334
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,207
You are the man.

1335
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,629
- What's the problem?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

1336
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,672
Jesus Christ, Stanley. You can't go now.

1337
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,841
You have one minute
before we're on the air.

1338
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,010
Now is not the time
to go to the bathroom.

1339
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:56,262
RICHARD: Why does this always happen?
- Hey.

1340
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,389
Excuse me, is there a problem over there?

1341
01:22:58,557 --> 01:22:59,807
Mind your own business.

1342
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,227
- You better watch your mouth.
- Why don't you mind your own business?

1343
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:06,272
LUIS: Oh, no, she didn't.
- Cool down. Cool it, please.

1344
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,817
Now, Stanley, wait for the
commercial break, then you can go.

1345
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,904
- Just hold it.
LUIS: Where did they get these kids?

1346
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,072
Don't taunt the kids.

1347
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,741
- I'm trying to be helpful.
CYNTH IA: Don't start trouble, Luis.

1348
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,703
Honey, you haven't seen trouble.
Wait till next commercial break.

1349
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,081
- What's the problem?
- Nothing.

1350
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,248
Lily! Please!

1351
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,292
FRANK
Order Seduce and Destroy...

1352
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,252
- Get away from me, you shithead!
- Okay.

1353
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:32,465
Can't afford it?
We'll work out something for you.

1354
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:34,759
Seduce and Destroy will change your life.

1355
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,427
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1356
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:38,888
No.

1357
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:43,267
Don't, don't, don't.

1358
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:47,772
- I'm gonna save you.
- Hi? Hello? Okay.

1359
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,982
I guarantee, money-back guarantee-

1360
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,318
- Don't eat these.
- This will change your life.

1361
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:56,447
It's gonna help you get
that naughty sauce that you...

1362
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:01,411
- For a low cost of 49.99...
PH IL: Here you go.

1363
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:08,668
Come on out of the cold
and order Seduce and Destroy...

1364
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:12,630
...for the low cost of 49.99.
We take all credit cards.

1365
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:16,843
- I take Visa, MasterCard...
PH IL: Out of the trash, out of the trash.

1366
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,096
Hey, Phil, are you there?

1367
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,431
- It's Chad.
- Yeah. Hi, Chad.

1368
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:25,226
Yeah, listen, I'm gonna put you in touch
with Janet, Frank's assistant.

1369
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,395
- Okay.
- And she's gonna see what she can do.

1370
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:30,231
Thank you very much,
and good luck to you and your mother.

1371
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,942
Thanks, man. You too.
Okay, Janet, are you there?

1372
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:36,070
Hello?
All right, Janet, you have Phil Parma.

1373
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,990
Okay?

1374
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:47,498
I have cancer, Mary.
I have about two months.

1375
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,459
I have no time.

1376
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,754
It's in my bones.
I don't have a chance.

1377
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,047
- Oh.
- I'm fucked.

1378
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:03,514
DIRECTOR: And 15 seconds.
LUIS: You got any cookies or anything?

1379
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:07,810
DIRECTOR:
Ten seconds.

1380
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:15,234
And five, four, three, two. . ..

1381
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,612
We're back, ready for Round Two.

1382
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,198
We're talking
to our adult contestants here today.

1383
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,075
Uh, Mim, it says here
that you live in California...

1384
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,660
...and that you have two kids.

1385
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,537
MIM:
Right. I have a six-year-old son...

1386
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,372
Do you know who I am?

1387
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,209
You're a friend of the family, I presume.

1388
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,877
What does that mean?

1389
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,214
Nothing special.
Just a spoke in the wheel.

1390
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:40,134
You talk in rhymes
and riddles and rub-a-dub...

1391
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:44,847
. .. but that doesn't mean anything to me.
See, see- See, I used to be smart.

1392
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,517
I'm "Quiz Kid" Donnie Smith.

1393
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:52,688
I'm "Quiz Kid" Donnie Smith
from TV.

1394
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,565
It might have been before my time.

1395
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,776
I remember now. In the sixties, right?

1396
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,695
- I'm "Quiz Kid" Donnie Smith.
- Like you said.

1397
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:04,242
Smart kid. You got struck by lightning
at one time, right?

1398
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,785
DONNIE:
So what?

1399
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:08,287
- I heard about that.
- Did it hurt?

1400
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:09,831
DONNIE:
Yes.

1401
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,750
But you're all right now.
So, what's the what?

1402
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:15,169
- What?
- That's right.

1403
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:18,631
I used to be smart. Now I'm just stupid.

1404
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:22,593
Ha! Brad, dear, who was it that said:

1405
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:26,597
"A man of genius has seldom been ruined
but by himself"?

1406
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,266
Um...

1407
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:32,228
The lovely Samuel Johnson.
- Ah.

1408
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,690
Who also spoke of a fellow
who was not only dull...

1409
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,608
. .. but a cause of dullness in others.

1410
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:39,318
DONNIE:
The cause of dullness in others.

1411
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:42,280
- Picky, picky.
- Let me tell you this.

1412
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:45,491
Samuel Johnson
never had his life shit on...

1413
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:48,619
. .. and taken from him,
and his money stolen.

1414
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,289
Who took his life and his money?

1415
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:55,042
His parents? His mommy and daddy?

1416
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,837
Make him live this life like this.

1417
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:02,133
A man of genius
who gets shit on as a child...

1418
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:05,303
. .. and that scars. That hurts.

1419
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,305
Have you ever been hit by lightning?

1420
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,182
It hurts. It doesn't happen to everyone.

1421
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,809
It's an electrical charge.

1422
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,312
It finds its way across the universe.. .

1423
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:19,108
. .. and it lands in your body
and your head.

1424
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:24,530
And as for "ruined but by himself"...

1425
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,617
. .. not if his parents
took his freaking life. ..

1426
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,869
. .. and his money,
and tell you to do this. . .

1427
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:33,080
. .. and to do that,
and if you don't, well... .

1428
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,000
Your parents took your money
that you won on that game show?

1429
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:39,253
Yes. They did.

1430
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:45,176
What does that mean,
"a spoke in the wheel"?

1431
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:48,262
Things go round and round, don't they?

1432
01:27:49,056 --> 01:27:51,807
Yes, they do. They do.

1433
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:54,352
But I'll make my dreams come true.

1434
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:57,688
Sounds sad as a weeping willow.

1435
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,941
I used to be smart.

1436
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,443
But now I'm just stupid.

1437
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,030
Shall we drink to that?

1438
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,658
Um, I wanna talk a little bit more
about your background.

1439
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,369
You made, um, some references earlier. ..

1440
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:17,500
. .. to, uh, subjective human experiences
and terrible things, and, um. . . .

1441
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:21,003
Actually, I'm confused about your past,
is the thing.

1442
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:24,215
- Is that still lingering? It's so boring.
- Just to clarify.. . .

1443
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:27,385
- Just wanna clear some things up.
- Useless. Mm.

1444
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,347
Excuse me. See- Thank you, Muff.
It's a funny thing that-

1445
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,849
This is an important element
of Seduce and Destroy.

1446
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:37,019
Facing the past is an important way
of not making progress.

1447
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,730
This is something I tell my men
over and over and over.

1448
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,983
GWENOVIER:
This isn't meant, um...

1449
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,944
See, I try to teach my students to ask:

1450
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:47,405
"What is it in aid of?"

1451
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,240
- Are you asking me that?
- Yes.

1452
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:53,202
- Well, in trying to figure out who you are. . . .
- In aid of what?

1453
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:56,998
Well, Frank, I'm saying
that in trying to figure out who you are-

1454
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,624
I have more important things...

1455
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:01,335
- . . .to put myself into.
- Well, no, it's all important.

1456
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:03,254
I think this is something important. ..

1457
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:05,923
. .. that you might need to think about
putting yourself into.

1458
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,092
- Mm. Not really.
- Um, look, Frank...

1459
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,386
. .. it's not like
I'm trying to attack you here.

1460
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:11,637
- No.
- I just-

1461
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:15,016
Okay. Hey, this is how you wanna spend
your time, then go, go, go.

1462
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,393
But you're gonna be surprised
at what a waste it is.

1463
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:21,772
"The most useless thing in the world
is that which is behind me. " Chapter Three.

1464
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,693
We talked earlier about your mother.. .

1465
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:28,279
. .. and we talked about your father
and his death.

1466
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:32,450
I don't want to be challenging,
but I have to ask, um...

1467
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:38,289
I just wanna clarify something.
Something that I understand...

1468
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:43,294
- I'm not sure I hear a question in here.
- I'm trying to put this as delicately as I can.

1469
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,254
What's the question?

1470
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:49,050
- Do you remember a Miss Simms?
- I know a lot of women.

1471
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,720
- I'm sure she remembers me, ha, ha.
- She does. From when you were a boy.

1472
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,805
- Yeah?
- She lived in Tarzana.

1473
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:57,558
That's my old stomping ground.

1474
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:02,271
Is this the attack portion
of the interview?

1475
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:07,818
- Is the girl coming in for the kill?
- No. This is about getting something right. . .

1476
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:10,279
. .. and clarifying answers
to an earlier question.

1477
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:11,989
What question?

1478
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:15,159
I was told that your mother died, Frank.

1479
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,795
That's what you heard.

1480
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:29,965
Do you remember Miss Simms?

1481
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:37,306
- No.
- Well, I talked to Miss Simms. . .

1482
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:42,853
. .. your neighbor and caretaker
after your mother died in 1 980. . .

1483
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:45,523
. .. and in my research...

1484
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:52,154
. .. I have you listed as the only son
of Earl and Lily Partridge.

1485
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:56,534
And what I learned from Barbara Simms
is that your mother, Lily...

1486
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:00,121
. .. died in 1 980.

1487
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,833
So, see, it's my understanding
that information supplied. . .

1488
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,252
. .. by you and your company...

1489
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:09,296
. .. and the answers
to the questions I've asked is incorrect. . .

1490
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,551
. .. and if I wanna get to the bottom
of who you are and why you are. . .

1491
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:19,223
. .. then I think that your family history,
your actual family history...

1492
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:25,146
Well, this is important.

1493
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,191
What is your fucking question?

1494
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,697
Well, I guess my question is this:

1495
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,243
Why would you lie, Frank?

1496
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:44,415
Kids, adults...

1497
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:48,335
. .. I would like you
to put yourself at a picnic.

1498
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,047
Uh, place yourself there
with your family and friends, if you'd like.

1499
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:55,217
You'll hear three musical notes,
and you are to tell me...

1500
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:59,221
. .. what it might represent
that you would find at a picnic.

1501
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:01,515
The first three notes. Guys?

1502
01:32:06,897 --> 01:32:08,772
JIMMY: Yes, Todd.
- Well, Jimmy, I know this.

1503
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:13,777
I have perfect pitch, you see,
and that would be A-D-E...

1504
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:17,615
- ... and that would represent lemonade.
JIMMY: For 250. Next notes, please.

1505
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:26,957
JIMMY: Todd?
That's E-G-G, which would be egg.

1506
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:31,170
JIMMY: For 500.
And the third set of notes. Guys?

1507
01:32:36,343 --> 01:32:39,428
- You don't want any water?
- No. I just. . ..

1508
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,138
I'm so fucked up right now, Alan.

1509
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:45,601
- There's just so much. So many things.
- Are you on drugs right now?

1510
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:49,271
If I tell you something, if I say things, then-
You're a lawyer, right?

1511
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:52,983
You can't say anything, tell anybody.
It's like a privilege. Attorney/client.

1512
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,319
- You understand?
- Not exactly.

1513
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,821
Like a shrink.
If I go see a shrink, I'm protected.

1514
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,324
I can say things. Oh, fuck.

1515
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:05,287
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Linda, you're safe, okay? It's all right.

1516
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:08,123
You're my friend.
You and Earl are clients.

1517
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,334
Whatever you wanna say
won't leave this room.

1518
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:13,003
You have something
you wanna say to me. . . .

1519
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:18,717
I have to tell you something.
I have something to tell you.

1520
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,180
I wanna change his will.
Can I change his will? I need to.

1521
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,683
No, you can't change his will.
Only Earl can.

1522
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,060
No, no, no. You see, um. . .

1523
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,105
. .. I never loved him.

1524
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,023
I never loved him. Earl.

1525
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,860
When I met him- When I started-
I met him, I fucked him, and I married him. ..

1526
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,863
. .. because I wanted his money.
You understand?

1527
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,865
Uh, I'm telling you this.

1528
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,618
I've never told anyone.
Uh, I didn't love him...

1529
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:47,371
. .. but now- I know I'm in that will.
We were all there.

1530
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:51,375
We made that thing. And the money I'll get.
I don't want it, because I love him now.

1531
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,753
I've fallen in love with him now for real,
as he's dying, and...

1532
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:58,215
Uh, I look at him, and he's about to go,
Alan. He's moments...

1533
01:33:59,426 --> 01:34:01,927
I took care of him through this, Alan.
What now, then?

1534
01:34:02,095 --> 01:34:03,137
JIMMY:
Let's listen.

1535
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:06,056
"Hello, Mary.
How are you and the seven kids?

1536
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:09,685
As you probably heard by now, we sure
gave that Pope a run for his money. "

1537
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,856
JIMMY: Mim.
MIM: Um, that would be Robert E. Lee.

1538
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:18,235
His wife was Mary Parke Custis.
I know he had seven children.

1539
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:23,073
Um, and he would be talking about Pope,
who he defeated at the Battle of Manassas.

1540
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:26,410
JIMMY:
Absolutely right, Miss Mim. Next question.

1541
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:28,954
Come on, come on, come on.
Snap out of it, man.

1542
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,498
Come on. Stanley.

1543
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:37,004
Bonjour, Josephine.
Maintenant je suis en Egypte.

1544
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:39,423
JIMMY:
Yes, Mim.

1545
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,759
MIM: Um, that would be Napoleon
speaking to Josephine.

1546
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:45,346
JIMMY:
Absolutely right, for 500. Next voice.

1547
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,850
I don't want him to die.
I didn't love him when we met.. .

1548
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,978
. .. and I did so many bad things to him
that he doesn't know.

1549
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:57,566
Things that I want to confess to him.
But now I do. I love him.

1550
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:02,946
- Linda, what kind of medication are you on?
- This isn't any fucking medication talking!

1551
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,783
Can you give me nothing?
You have power of attorney.

1552
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,495
Can you go in the final fucking moments
and change the will?

1553
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,413
I- I don't want any money.

1554
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:15,042
I couldn't live with myself
with this thing that I've done.

1555
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:18,337
I fucked around. I fucking cheated on him.
I fucking cheated on him.

1556
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:20,923
There. There.
You're his lawyer, our lawyer.

1557
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:23,634
I am his wife. We are married.
I broke the contract of marriage.

1558
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:27,805
I fucked around on him many times.
I sucked other men's cocks.

1559
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,640
Adultery is not against the law.

1560
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:32,810
It's not something you can use in court
to discredit the will.

1561
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,437
- Linda. Linda, calm down.
- I can't.

1562
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:37,648
You don't have to change the will.

1563
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:41,151
If you wanna take nothing,
renounce the will when the time comes.

1564
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:43,445
What does that mean?
Where does the money go?

1565
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:48,158
- It goes to the nearest relative.
- What's that? Frank?

1566
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:52,496
No, no, no. That can't happen.
Earl doesn't want him to have anything.

1567
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,873
- That's what will happen.
- This is so fucked up.

1568
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:56,333
Linda, stop!

1569
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,587
Now, you take a moment, you breathe...

1570
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,340
- . . .and one thing at a time.
- Shut the fuck up.

1571
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:05,968
- You want me to help you?
- Shut the fuck up.

1572
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:09,054
- You need to sober up.
- Now, you must really shut the fuck up.

1573
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:11,014
Now. Please, shut the fuck up.

1574
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,183
- Linda.
- I have to go.

1575
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:16,270
- Let me call you a car, Linda.
- Shut the fuck up.

1576
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:20,399
JIMMY: Now, imagine
that you are attending a jam session...

1577
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:22,860
. .. of classical composers...

1578
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:27,656
. .. and they have each done an arrangement
of the classic favorite, "Whispering. "

1579
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,784
Now, we have here
the New World Harmonica Trio. . .

1580
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:33,120
. .. who are going to play, uh-

1581
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:38,542
Uh, three, um-
Uh, variations on the theme...

1582
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,960
. .. as the, uh- As-

1583
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,629
As three classical composers
might have written it.

1584
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:46,383
So you are to name the, uh, first composer.

1585
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:47,926
Guys?

1586
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,901
JIMMY: Yes, Todd.
- Well, Jimmy, that sounded like Brahms.

1587
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,403
Uh, a bit like his
"Hungarian Dance Number Six. "

1588
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:09,656
That is excellent, Todd.
Next composer, guys.

1589
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:38,393
Stanley the man.

1590
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:42,189
I don't know the answer.

1591
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:45,192
That is not right.

1592
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,985
That's not right, Stanley.

1593
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:51,114
The correct answer is Ravel.

1594
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,325
Ravel.

1595
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:58,121
Uh, and now I'm gonna have
our three whistlers, um...

1596
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:03,835
. .. please to present the next, uh, musical... .

1597
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:06,964
There were three, uh,
musical sections here. . .

1598
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,967
. .. and this will be the third section
that the whistlers. . ..

1599
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,428
Um, and they'll play a piece that's...

1600
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:19,351
It's very recognizable.
It's Chopin, actually, and, uh.. . .

1601
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,647
Well, it's taken-
It's in the style of "Marche Militaire. "

1602
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:26,984
It's a very recognizable piece.

1603
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,362
So if you please just listen to this. . .

1604
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:34,575
. .. and I'm sure you can identify the, uh. ...

1605
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,827
I'm sort of
giving away the answer here, but-

1606
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:39,830
It's Chopin. I don't mean
to give away the answer.

1607
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:43,041
It's just- Please, just-

1608
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:46,503
Well, sing us a ditty, guys.
A Chopin ditty.

1609
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:51,174
Let's have a Chopin ditty here. I can't. . . .

1610
01:38:52,302 --> 01:38:55,554
- Go to the card. Go to the fucking card.
- Go to the card. Go.

1611
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:57,681
Go to the card.

1612
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:06,565
Okay, I'm back.

1613
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:09,067
JIM: For not a fresh cup,
this is a good cup of coffee.

1614
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:11,653
CLAUDIA: Thank you.
What do you wanna talk about?

1615
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:16,491
I don't know.

1616
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,911
- Do you want to talk?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1617
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:21,496
- Okay.
- Um...

1618
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:24,041
What's your name?

1619
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,792
Jim Kurring.

1620
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,545
Call 911.
- I think I had a stroke.

1621
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:31,715
No, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1622
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,844
- I wanna finish the show.
No, we need to call this quits.

1623
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:38,221
- Get your hands off me.
- Let this guy help you.

1624
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:42,017
- Look, I just- I'll tell you what happened.
- Call 91 1 . Do it right now, Mary.

1625
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:45,896
I fell down and I couldn't see for a minute,
but I'm okay. Get your hands off me.

1626
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:57,115
- Did you fucking piss your pants?
- Shut up.

1627
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,701
- What happened? What's going on?
- Nothing. Go away.

1628
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:01,119
Don't tell me to go away.

1629
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:05,290
I'm the coordinator for the show,
and you will answer the questions I ask.

1630
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:09,419
- Now, what is going on? You-
- What's the problem?

1631
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:12,297
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- Why didn't you answer those questions?

1632
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:14,591
- I didn't know the answer.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

1633
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:16,551
You know the answer to every question.

1634
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,054
I knew the answers.
I'm not half as smart as you. ..

1635
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,847
. .. so what the hell happened?

1636
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,433
- I don't know.
- He pissed his pants.

1637
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:27,187
You pissed your pants?

1638
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,106
- No, I didn't. I'm fine.
- Stand up.

1639
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:32,317
- I said I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Stand up.

1640
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:35,195
Oh, Jesus, Stanley,
what the fuck did you do that for?

1641
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:38,699
I just wanna keep playing.
I'll keep playing. I'm fine.

1642
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,450
That's great.

1643
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:44,371
I mean, you know that,
to a performer, that's food, right?

1644
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,332
That shows that you love him,
and I'm sure he appreciates it.

1645
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,544
Everything's fine. Relax.
Relax, darling. Everything's fine.

1646
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:53,797
I'm okay.

1647
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:56,967
All right, see? I'm all right.

1648
01:40:57,135 --> 01:41:00,053
It's pretty fucking stupid,
isn't it? Jesus Christ.

1649
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:02,347
What the fuck do they think out there?

1650
01:41:02,515 --> 01:41:04,516
They must be laughing their asses off.

1651
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:07,144
Tell them I got a bad knee
or some fucking thing.

1652
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:08,687
Ha, ha. This is fucking funny.

1653
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:12,107
- What do you guys wanna do?
- Just what I said.

1654
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,115
- Are we going to continue with this game?
- Yes.

1655
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,659
All right, you look at me. Look at me.

1656
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:26,913
You are two days away from this record.
Okay? Nobody's ever done that.

1657
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:30,000
You get through this,
I'll get you anything you want. Anything.

1658
01:41:30,168 --> 01:41:33,503
- You just gotta get through this, okay?
- Okay.

1659
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,508
Hang in there, buddy.
I'm sorry I squeezed your arm.

1660
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:40,635
Hey. I love you.

1661
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,890
- Are we doing this?
Fucking stupidity.

1662
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:48,101
- Why don't I put the medic on?
- Don't let him do this.

1663
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:50,520
- He's been doing it for 30 years.
- You don't know.

1664
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:52,898
It's a fucking game show, Mary.

1665
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:00,864
Hear that?

1666
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:07,204
JIM: Ah, yeah. Does that hurt?
- No.

1667
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:12,667
- What is it?
- It's in my ear.

1668
01:42:13,503 --> 01:42:16,004
It's, um, TMJ.

1669
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:19,216
It's what it's called. Technically.

1670
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:23,762
How about they just call it,
you know, "clicking jaw"?

1671
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:26,556
- "Pain in the jaw," yeah. Ha, ha.
- Yeah. How about that?

1672
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:30,227
- Be easier to remember.
- Yeah. It gets. ...

1673
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:33,647
I- I don't even know if I have it, actually.

1674
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:37,400
WOMAN
15-L-27, 15-L-27, head out to...

1675
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,693
I'm sorry.

1676
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,446
1 5-L-27, I'm currently code seven.

1677
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:43,573
I'm sorry. This is my job.

1678
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:44,741
L-27, roger.

1679
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:48,328
William-35, can you see if you
can raise 10-William-28 for me?

1680
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:51,081
Roger. Disregard.
It was just the information passed on.

1681
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,542
You were just getting warmed up.
Getting started.

1682
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:55,919
Yeah. I gotta go.

1683
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:01,132
Well, if this joker shows up again,
or you got your music up too loud.. .

1684
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,468
. .. maybe we can have another cup
of coffee.

1685
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:05,387
If you're not here for a 1 87.

1686
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:11,476
- No. Do not joke about that, okay?
- Okay.

1687
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,522
- I seen too many of those.
- I'm sorry.

1688
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:18,692
No. it's all right.
You were kidding. It's okay.

1689
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,654
All right.

1690
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:25,615
Well, you keep your chin up
and your music down, okay?

1691
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:28,159
Yes, I will.
It was nice to meet you, Officer Jim.

1692
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,161
- Just Jim.
- Yeah. Good. Okay.

1693
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:34,624
- Okay. Bye-bye, Claudia.
- Bye.

1694
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:04,821
- What is it? Did you forget something?
- No. No, I'm...

1695
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:07,824
I was- I was wondering. . . .

1696
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,452
Man, I feel like a bit
of a scumbucket doing this. . .

1697
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,829
. .. since I came here
as an officer of the law...

1698
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:16,625
. .. but I feel like I'd be a fool
if I didn't do something I really wanna do. ..

1699
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:20,337
- . . .which is to ask you for a date.
- You wanna go on a date with me?

1700
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:21,838
- Please, yes.
- Ahem.

1701
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:24,716
- Well, is that illegal?
- Sort of.

1702
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:27,093
Then I'd like to go.
What do you wanna do?

1703
01:44:28,054 --> 01:44:32,599
I don't know. I hadn't thought about it.
That's not true. I have thought about it.

1704
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:35,226
I've been thinking
since you opened the door.

1705
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:37,354
- Really?
- Yeah.

1706
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:39,397
I thought you were flirting with me.

1707
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:40,941
You want to go tonight?

1708
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,818
I'm- No- I'm off tonight, yeah.
That would be-

1709
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:46,363
- What time?
-8 o'clock.

1710
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:48,949
- I don't get off until 10:00.
-10 o'clock.

1711
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:51,117
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1712
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:53,870
- Yeah. Fine.
- Yeah. Bye.

1713
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:59,292
GWENOVIER: Frank, I'm really
not trying to attack you here.

1714
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:04,464
I think that if you have something
that needs to be cleared up, well, then...

1715
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:11,388
I was told that your father
is Earl Partridge.

1716
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:14,516
I was told that he left
you and your mother...

1717
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:18,019
. .. and you were forced to take care
of your mother during her illness. . .

1718
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:21,731
. .. that you took care of your mother
while she struggled with cancer. . .

1719
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,234
. .. and that Miss Simms
became your caretaker. . .

1720
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:27,445
. .. when your mother finally passed away.

1721
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:32,826
Can you talk about your mother, Frank?

1722
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:37,580
No, not true. You know what?
Even if you don't get to pump her. . .

1723
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:40,125
. .. you still need to start honing your skills
on a feminist.

1724
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,962
- You need to do that.
I will.

1725
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,588
- This is Doc.
Doc, it's Janet.

1726
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:48,299
- What's up, Janet?
- I have to talk to Frank. Is he nearby?

1727
01:45:48,467 --> 01:45:50,802
- Uh, he's in the interview, Janet.
- Interrupt him.

1728
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:53,930
- Get him on the phone with me right away.
- What happened?

1729
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,766
Doc, go get Frank
and put him on the phone.

1730
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:01,563
GWENOVIER:
Oh, come on, Frank.

1731
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:03,440
What are you doing?

1732
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,111
What am I doing?

1733
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,488
Yeah.

1734
01:46:12,116 --> 01:46:15,493
I'm quietly judging you.

1735
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:22,292
And five, four, three, two. . ..

1736
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:26,046
Yeah?

1737
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,339
Oh, boy, what a day. What a round.

1738
01:46:28,507 --> 01:46:30,175
Back and in for me. . .

1739
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:35,180
. .. and the final one-on-one round
to determine who's who today.

1740
01:46:35,347 --> 01:46:38,141
Let's check the scores
on the board, shall we?

1741
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,853
Well, the kids have an even 2000...

1742
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:46,149
. .. and the adults are way up with 47.

1743
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:51,738
Now, that doesn't mean
that this game is out of reach for the kids.

1744
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:55,325
- Elders, who's the lucky so-and-so?
- It's gonna be me, Jimmy.

1745
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:58,495
Come on over, Mim.

1746
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,749
I don't wanna go. I can't do it this time.

1747
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:04,667
What the fuck are you talking about?

1748
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:08,505
You have to go, Stanley.
You're the smartest.

1749
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,715
I don't wanna go.
Why can't one of you do it?

1750
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:15,053
RICHARD: If you don't fucking stand up
and get over there, I'm gonna beat your ass.

1751
01:47:15,221 --> 01:47:18,890
I'm sick of being the one
who always has to do everything.

1752
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:23,144
- I don't wanna be the one always.
JIMMY: Kids, I don't even have to ask.

1753
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:25,939
Stanley, get your butt over here.

1754
01:47:32,655 --> 01:47:34,739
I'm sick.

1755
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:36,866
I'm sick here now.

1756
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:40,286
I confuse melancholy
with depression sometimes.

1757
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:43,414
- Mm-hm.
- You see?

1758
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:46,960
Why don't you run along now, friend?
Your dessert is getting cold.

1759
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:50,046
- I'm sick.
Stay that way.

1760
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:52,006
I'm sick, and I'm in love.

1761
01:47:52,174 --> 01:47:55,593
You seem the sort of person
who confuses the two.

1762
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:57,637
That's right.

1763
01:47:57,805 --> 01:48:00,265
That's the first time you've been right.

1764
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:04,060
I confuse the two, and I don't care.

1765
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:07,897
Hey. Hey!

1766
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:10,900
I love you.

1767
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:12,735
I love you, and I'm sick.

1768
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:15,280
I'll talk to you-
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1769
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:19,075
I'm getting corrective oral surgery
tomorrow, for my teeth.

1770
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,828
I love you, Brad. Brad the bartender.

1771
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:24,581
If you wanna love me back,
I'll be good to you.

1772
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:26,499
I'll be goddamn good for you.

1773
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:29,752
I won't be mad
if you don't know who said what.

1774
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,088
I won't punish you
if you get the answer wrong.

1775
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,716
Brad, honey.
- I can teach and tell you...

1776
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:37,468
You have a special secret crush
over there, I think.

1777
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:39,929
Don't treat him too lovely.
He might get hurt.

1778
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,765
- You shut up! Mind your own business.
- Gently, son.

1779
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:44,350
I know you don't love me now.

1780
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:47,270
It's a dangerous thing
to confuse children with angels.

1781
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:51,774
Wanna know the common element
for the entire group, like he asked?

1782
01:48:51,942 --> 01:48:54,527
I'll tell you the answer,
because I had that one.

1783
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:56,529
I had that question.

1784
01:48:56,697 --> 01:48:59,616
Uh, carbon. Carbon.

1785
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:02,118
In pencil lead,
it's in the form of graphite. ..

1786
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:05,163
. .. in coal,
it's mixed up with other impurities. . .

1787
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:08,374
. .. and in the diamond, it's in hard form.

1788
01:49:08,959 --> 01:49:12,462
"Well, all we really wanted to know
was the common element, Donnie...

1789
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,131
. .. but thank you for all
that unnecessary knowledge. Ha, ha.

1790
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:17,717
Kids. Heads so full of useless knowledge.

1791
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:19,928
Thank you. Thank you. "

1792
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:23,139
The book says, "We may be
through with the past...

1793
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:26,142
. .. but the past is not through with us. "

1794
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:28,645
And. . . .

1795
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:34,025
No, it is not dangerous
to confuse children with angels.

1796
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:48,164
Yeah. Okay.

1797
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:51,084
Well, that is what I wait for.

1798
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:54,712
I wait for those calls.
And I wait and I pray.

1799
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,674
And sometimes Jesus says:

1800
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,134
"Jim, I got a surprise for you today.

1801
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:02,679
I want you to meet this young lady, okay?

1802
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:05,556
Now, where it goes from there
is up to you.

1803
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:09,769
And I don't think
you're gonna screw it up, okay?"

1804
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:12,438
And, God, I'm telling you right now...

1805
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,149
. .. I will not screw it up.
You gave me an opportunity.

1806
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:17,527
I'm gonna treat this young lady right.

1807
01:50:17,695 --> 01:50:20,071
I'm a happy cop.

1808
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:24,200
Yeah. It's called jaywalking. Slow down.

1809
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,524
Uh, I'm gonna pass, Jimmy.

1810
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:00,361
JIMMY:
Stanley, passing to one of the other kids.

1811
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:05,033
We want Stanley to go, Jimmy.

1812
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:06,909
I don't wanna go.

1813
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,956
- Walking towards the elevator, Janet.
Fine. Phil, are you still there?

1814
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:14,417
PH IL: Yeah, I'm here.
I wanna ask you one question.

1815
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:17,211
Phil, have you talked to anyone else
about this?

1816
01:51:17,379 --> 01:51:20,048
PH IL: No, I haven't.
Good, let's keep it that way, okay?

1817
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:22,258
All the security and whatnot.
You understand?

1818
01:51:22,426 --> 01:51:24,969
This could be a delicate situation
for the family.

1819
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:28,139
What's going on? What's happening?
Doc, fuck off.

1820
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:30,391
Phil, hang in just one more minute, okay?

1821
01:51:30,559 --> 01:51:32,477
- I'm gonna put you on hold.
PH IL: Thank you.

1822
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:33,936
How close are you, Doc?

1823
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:36,481
Richard? Julia?

1824
01:51:36,648 --> 01:51:40,109
Kids, what's going on?

1825
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:42,737
I need a player here for one-on-one.

1826
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:47,658
RICHARD: We want Stanley to go, Jimmy,
and we're not sure why he won't.

1827
01:51:47,826 --> 01:51:51,871
I always go. I always answer the questions,
and I don't wanna do it anymore.

1828
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:55,500
What the fuck is he doing?
What's wrong with him?

1829
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:57,710
I have no idea.

1830
01:52:00,672 --> 01:52:05,301
- I'm getting off the elevator, Janet.
Good. Good boy.

1831
01:52:05,469 --> 01:52:08,554
I'm walking down the hall.

1832
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:02,316
This fucking kid ain't getting up,
and we don't have a show.

1833
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:04,527
Live television, ladies and germs. Heh.

1834
01:53:04,695 --> 01:53:06,362
Little prick.

1835
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:11,033
- What is this, a point? A game?
- What the hell is he doing?

1836
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:14,537
Come on. Get the fuck up, kid, come on.

1837
01:53:20,169 --> 01:53:21,961
Time's up.

1838
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:26,507
So that's what you did? You sat it out?

1839
01:53:27,676 --> 01:53:31,262
You wanted my time. I gave it to you.

1840
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:35,224
You called me a liar.
You made accusations.

1841
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:36,684
You said:

1842
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:39,645
"Well, if I had known,
then I wouldn't have asked. "

1843
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:42,315
So it's not an attack.

1844
01:53:42,483 --> 01:53:46,736
See, I don't wanna be the sort of fella
who doesn't keep his word...

1845
01:53:46,904 --> 01:53:49,405
. .. so I gave you my fucking time, bitch.

1846
01:53:49,573 --> 01:53:51,407
- Now fuck-
- Unh!

1847
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:59,749
It's fucking Janet.
There's a situation on the phone.

1848
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:06,255
FRANK Ifyou order now,
you can get Seduce and Destroy...

1849
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:09,926
...plus videos and audio cassettes,
and a coupon...

1850
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:12,762
...for Frank T.J. Mackey's next seminar.

1851
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:25,149
The indecision of a child,
ladies and germs.

1852
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:39,121
This isn't funny.

1853
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:42,542
This isn't cute.

1854
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:45,336
See, the way we're looked at. . . .

1855
01:54:47,548 --> 01:54:49,799
Because I'm not a toy.

1856
01:54:49,967 --> 01:54:52,134
I'm not a doll.

1857
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:55,137
The way we're looked
at because you think we're cute.

1858
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:57,807
Because what?

1859
01:54:57,975 --> 01:55:00,351
What? I'm made to feel like a freak...

1860
01:55:00,519 --> 01:55:03,020
. .. if I answer questions. . .

1861
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:05,064
. .. or I'm smart. . .

1862
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,485
. .. or I have to go to the bathroom?

1863
01:55:10,946 --> 01:55:13,030
What is that, Jimmy?

1864
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:15,199
What is that?

1865
01:55:15,367 --> 01:55:17,952
I'm asking- I'm asking you that.

1866
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:21,455
I'm not sure, Stanley.

1867
01:56:01,496 --> 01:56:04,040
JIM:
15-L-27, uh, I need some help.

1868
01:56:04,207 --> 01:56:06,208
We have shots fired.

1869
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:14,342
DONNIE:
It's Hamlet to Claudius.

1870
01:56:14,509 --> 01:56:19,472
"The sins of the father laid upon
the children" is Merchant of Venice.

1871
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:23,684
Borrowed from Exodus 25.

1872
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:26,646
I'm sorry. I didn't know what else
you wanted me to do here.

1873
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:29,398
There was nothing-
I asked him all the right questions.

1874
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:32,234
He's his nurse.
He's sitting there with him.

1875
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:37,657
- I heard your father in the background.
- Wait. He's there at their house?

1876
01:56:37,824 --> 01:56:43,871
They're at the house. I asked him
the exact address, and he gave it, Frank.

1877
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:46,624
I know this is really hard for you
right now.

1878
01:56:46,792 --> 01:56:49,335
No. You gotta give me things, Janet.
Give me things.

1879
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:52,421
Give me information.
I want the information. That's what I want.

1880
01:56:52,589 --> 01:56:54,882
- That's the information, Frank.
- What did he say?

1881
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:58,594
I am not gonna take care of him.
What does he want? Did he say?

1882
01:56:58,762 --> 01:57:01,347
Frank, what the fuck
do you want me to do?

1883
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:03,766
- Listen.
- What I want you to do, Janet...

1884
01:57:03,934 --> 01:57:06,977
. .. is I want you to do your fucking job!

1885
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:10,439
I am doing my fucking job, Frank.

1886
01:57:10,607 --> 01:57:12,900
You fucking get on the phone.

1887
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,201
I'm not a doll. I'm not silly and cute.

1888
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:24,328
I'm smart.
That should make me something...

1889
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:27,039
. .. so people can watch
how silly it is that he's smart!

1890
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:28,624
I know. I know things.

1891
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:30,626
I know- I know...

1892
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:34,922
I know
I have to go to the bathroom, and.. . .

1893
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:37,299
Take us off the air. Go to the credits.

1894
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:38,884
- Roll the credits.
Enough.

1895
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:41,137
God fucking damn it! Son of a bitch!

1896
01:57:41,304 --> 01:57:43,639
What the fuck? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1897
01:57:43,807 --> 01:57:45,474
Stanley, don't do this to me!

1898
01:58:07,664 --> 01:58:09,790
Gotta find the gun.

1899
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:11,834
Where is it, now?

1900
01:58:12,502 --> 01:58:13,919
Where is it?

1901
01:58:17,215 --> 01:58:19,341
All right. All right, let's go.

1902
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:21,677
Where is it? Find it.

1903
01:58:24,055 --> 01:58:25,723
Find it.

1904
01:58:27,017 --> 01:58:29,393
Find the gun, Jim!

1905
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:07,681
What more do you want me to say?
- Just give me a second.

1906
01:59:07,849 --> 01:59:10,100
You need to make a decision.

1907
01:59:10,268 --> 01:59:13,938
- Look, why don't you-?
- Look, just give me a second.

1908
01:59:14,105 --> 01:59:16,398
- Give me a second.
- Uh-huh.

1909
01:59:19,152 --> 01:59:20,861
Frank?

1910
01:59:22,864 --> 01:59:24,406
What the fuck, Frank?

1911
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:26,534
What do you want me to do?

1912
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:31,789
FRANK I'm gonna say
again. Order Seduce and Destroy now...

1913
01:59:31,957 --> 01:59:34,416
...and I guarantee, I guarantee,
money-back-

1914
01:59:55,647 --> 01:59:57,106
PH IL:
Linda.

1915
01:59:57,274 --> 02:00:00,568
- What are you doing?
- I got Frank. Frank, Earl's son.

1916
02:00:00,735 --> 02:00:02,570
- Hang up.
- No, he asked me to get him.

1917
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:04,071
LINDA:
Put the fucking phone down!

1918
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:07,116
- Hang it up! Hang it up!
- I can't! I can't!

1919
02:00:07,284 --> 02:00:10,536
Frank, are you there?

1920
02:00:10,704 --> 02:00:12,872
I want you to talk to him.

1921
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:17,334
Frank?

1922
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:23,048
I'm gonna put him on.

1923
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:25,426
Hang it up! You don't do that.

1924
02:00:25,594 --> 02:00:27,553
You don't call him. You don't know.

1925
02:00:27,721 --> 02:00:30,639
To get involved in this business of his.
Of his- Of my family.

1926
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:32,975
This is the family.
Me and him. Understand?

1927
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:36,103
- There's no one else. No one else!
- I was just-

1928
02:00:36,271 --> 02:00:39,148
That man. That beautiful man. . ..

1929
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:43,652
His son does not exist.
He's dead. He's dead.

1930
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,279
Who asked you to do that?

1931
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:46,906
- Earl did.
- Bullshit!

1932
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:50,576
- He did. Please, I'm sorry, he did.
- Bullshit! He didn't ask you!

1933
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:54,330
He doesn't wanna talk to him,
so fuck you that he asked that!

1934
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:58,000
There's no one but me and him! No one!

1935
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:01,503
I'm sorry. I... He just.. . . He asked me.

1936
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:05,299
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1937
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:30,866
Mary, take me out of here.
I got to go home to Rose.

1938
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:32,868
- Just lean on me.
Mary, take him home.

1939
02:01:33,036 --> 02:01:34,703
- In the back.
- Did we win or lose?

1940
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:36,330
I don't know. We gotta talk.

1941
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:39,041
You lost. They go to the score
the time they called it.

1942
02:01:39,209 --> 02:01:41,710
JULIA: That's not an official rule.
- Not an official rule?

1943
02:01:41,878 --> 02:01:44,296
- That's an official rule, baby.
- That's bullshit!

1944
02:01:44,464 --> 02:01:47,883
Who says that? In what rule book?
This is different! It's a game show!

1945
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:52,304
- They don't go by fucking sports rules!
- Richard, shut it and cut it out.

1946
02:01:52,472 --> 02:01:55,557
If he hadn't pissed his pants,
we would have won this motherfucker!

1947
02:01:56,935 --> 02:01:58,894
What did you do with my goddamn kid,
Burt?

1948
02:01:59,062 --> 02:02:03,691
Stanley! Get your fucking hands off me,
you boy-producer punk. Hey, Stanley!

1949
02:02:04,776 --> 02:02:08,529
Oh, Lord, why is this happening to me?

1950
02:02:08,697 --> 02:02:10,906
God, please help me figure it out.

1951
02:02:11,074 --> 02:02:13,784
I'm lost out here.

1952
02:02:14,452 --> 02:02:16,870
I don't understand
why it's happening, God.

1953
02:02:17,038 --> 02:02:18,998
Please, God.

1954
02:02:21,835 --> 02:02:25,045
Whatever it is I did, I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna do the right thing.

1955
02:02:25,213 --> 02:02:27,881
Please, God, help me find the gun.

1956
02:02:29,926 --> 02:02:31,343
Uh. . ..

1957
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:39,161
I love you.

1958
02:04:27,836 --> 02:04:29,920
Uh, listen, Phil.

1959
02:04:30,755 --> 02:04:31,964
Um...

1960
02:04:33,133 --> 02:04:34,883
I'm sorry.

1961
02:04:35,426 --> 02:04:37,678
I'm sorry I slapped your face.

1962
02:04:38,054 --> 02:04:40,556
Okay? I , um...

1963
02:04:40,723 --> 02:04:42,808
I don't know what I'm doing.

1964
02:04:42,976 --> 02:04:45,102
I don't know how to do this.

1965
02:04:47,397 --> 02:04:49,314
I do things, and I fuck up.

1966
02:04:51,401 --> 02:04:53,277
I fucked up.

1967
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:57,281
Can you forgive me?

1968
02:04:57,448 --> 02:04:59,950
Yeah. It's all right.

1969
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:08,250
Can you tell him I'm sorry...

1970
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:12,004
. .. for the things that I've done,
that I fucked up?

1971
02:05:12,881 --> 02:05:15,090
I'm sorry. Um... .

1972
02:05:16,593 --> 02:05:19,094
I'm going to turn and walk away
and not look at him. . .

1973
02:05:19,262 --> 02:05:22,973
. .. and not see my man, my Earl,
and tell him, uh. . . .

1974
02:05:23,141 --> 02:05:28,645
Tell him, "It's okay. I'm okay. "

1975
02:05:28,813 --> 02:05:31,315
Tell him, "Thank you for taking care... ."

1976
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:36,778
Whole thing is okay with me.

1977
02:05:38,156 --> 02:05:40,073
And I know.

1978
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:06,475
Welcome back from the break.

1979
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:11,939
- How did you guys like those nachos?
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1980
02:06:12,106 --> 02:06:16,652
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well,
you are not here for the fucking food.

1981
02:06:16,819 --> 02:06:21,323
You are here for me to enlighten you,
to edify you.. .

1982
02:06:21,491 --> 02:06:25,285
. .. to send you off
into the now-not-so-unknown future. . .

1983
02:06:25,453 --> 02:06:27,162
. .. so come along with me.

1984
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:30,332
"How to fake
like you are nice and caring. "

1985
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:32,251
No, I don't want a microphone.

1986
02:06:32,418 --> 02:06:34,002
Now, this... .

1987
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:39,216
Ahem, this is quite an important chapter,
as you will see.

1988
02:06:39,384 --> 02:06:44,221
But let's get down to brass tacks.
Let's get right down to it, boys.

1989
02:06:44,389 --> 02:06:49,476
- Men are shit.
AUDIENCE: What?

1990
02:06:49,644 --> 02:06:53,855
What? Men are shit.

1991
02:06:55,483 --> 02:06:57,526
Well, isn't that what they say?

1992
02:06:57,694 --> 02:07:04,700
Because we do bad things, don't we?
We do horrible, heinous, terrible things.

1993
02:07:04,867 --> 02:07:09,204
Things that no woman would ever do.

1994
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:13,125
No, women, they don't lie.

1995
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:16,003
No, women don't cheat.

1996
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,380
Women don't manipulate us.

1997
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:24,386
But you see what I'm getting at.
Oh, yeah, you see what I'm getting at.

1998
02:07:24,554 --> 02:07:26,888
You see what society does? Boy.
Little boys, it's:

1999
02:07:27,056 --> 02:07:30,851
Wow. Woman.

2000
02:07:32,228 --> 02:07:35,230
- We are taught to apologize. "I am sorry. "
Give it up.

2001
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:38,525
"I am so sorry, baby. I am so sorry. "

2002
02:07:42,155 --> 02:07:43,780
What is it that-?

2003
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:46,825
What is it, huh, that we need?

2004
02:07:46,993 --> 02:07:51,163
Is it their pussies? Their, uh, love?

2005
02:07:51,331 --> 02:07:53,290
Mommy wouldn't let me play soccer...

2006
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:57,461
. .. and Daddy, oh, he hit me,
so that's who I am.

2007
02:07:57,628 --> 02:08:00,547
That's why I do what I do? Heh.

2008
02:08:00,715 --> 02:08:03,592
- Fucking bullshit.
That's right.

2009
02:08:07,138 --> 02:08:10,974
- I will not apologize for who I am.
Right on.

2010
02:08:11,142 --> 02:08:14,978
- I will not apologize for what I need.
Yeah.

2011
02:08:15,146 --> 02:08:18,899
- I will not apologize for what I want!
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

2012
02:08:20,485 --> 02:08:23,487
Okay. Go to your blue booklets right now.

2013
02:08:23,654 --> 02:08:27,949
I want you to turn to page 1 8
in your blue booklets.

2014
02:08:28,826 --> 02:08:31,620
Fuck. This is fucking bullshit!

2015
02:08:33,373 --> 02:08:36,792
I want you to go to your white-
Your white books.

2016
02:08:36,959 --> 02:08:38,960
That's what I want you to go to.

2017
02:08:39,587 --> 02:08:42,297
Go to 23 in your white books.

2018
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:47,219
"How to fake
like you are a nice and caring person. "

2019
02:08:50,139 --> 02:08:54,351
Phil. Phil.

2020
02:08:54,519 --> 02:08:58,105
Hey, come here. Come here.

2021
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:00,482
Uh. . .

2022
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:02,526
. .. Phil.. .

2023
02:09:02,693 --> 02:09:04,986
. .. I'm.. . .

2024
02:09:05,154 --> 02:09:08,240
- I'm gonna try talk.
- Okay.

2025
02:09:08,408 --> 02:09:10,575
And I'm trying to. . . .

2026
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:13,829
- To say something.
- Okay.

2027
02:09:14,414 --> 02:09:17,124
Do you know Lily, Phil?
Do you know her?

2028
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:18,333
No.

2029
02:09:18,501 --> 02:09:21,795
- Lily?
- No, I don't.

2030
02:09:21,963 --> 02:09:23,505
Oh.

2031
02:09:23,673 --> 02:09:27,509
She's my love, my life, love of it. Yeah.

2032
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:29,719
In school. . ..

2033
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:34,057
I'm 1 2 years old, in school,
in sixth grade.

2034
02:09:34,225 --> 02:09:36,017
I saw her.

2035
02:09:37,145 --> 02:09:40,313
Yeah. I didn't go to that school, but. . . .

2036
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:44,609
But, uh, we met.

2037
02:09:44,777 --> 02:09:47,863
Uh, my friend knew her.

2038
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:50,407
I said, uh:

2039
02:09:50,575 --> 02:09:53,368
"What's that girl? How's that Lily?"

2040
02:09:53,536 --> 02:09:56,872
"Oh, she's bad.
She sleeps with guys. "

2041
02:09:58,249 --> 02:10:01,877
Yeah, he said this,
but then, sometimes.. . .

2042
02:10:02,044 --> 02:10:05,255
And I went to another school, you see.

2043
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:07,632
Uh, but then, uh... .

2044
02:10:09,343 --> 02:10:11,845
When high school at an end, what's that?

2045
02:10:12,013 --> 02:10:15,974
- What is that, uh, when it gets to the end?
- Graduation.

2046
02:10:16,142 --> 02:10:19,394
- No, no, the grade. What grade are you in?
- That's 1 2th.

2047
02:10:19,562 --> 02:10:21,605
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2048
02:10:22,523 --> 02:10:26,860
Yeah. So I went to her school
for that grade.

2049
02:10:28,029 --> 02:10:31,198
That's grade 1 2.

2050
02:10:31,365 --> 02:10:33,909
And we meet.

2051
02:10:34,577 --> 02:10:36,411
She was...

2052
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:40,081
. .. fucking like a doll.

2053
02:10:40,249 --> 02:10:45,212
Yeah. A beautiful porcelain doll.

2054
02:10:45,379 --> 02:10:47,255
And the hips.

2055
02:10:47,423 --> 02:10:49,591
The child-bearing hips, you know that?

2056
02:10:52,428 --> 02:10:55,096
So beautiful.

2057
02:11:00,353 --> 02:11:02,062
And I cheated on her...

2058
02:11:02,230 --> 02:11:07,526
. .. over and over and over again.. .

2059
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:11,571
. .. because I wanted to be a man...

2060
02:11:11,739 --> 02:11:14,491
. .. and I didn't want her to be a woman.

2061
02:11:14,659 --> 02:11:19,287
You know, a smart, free person. . .

2062
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:22,123
. .. who was something.

2063
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:25,252
My fucking mind then.

2064
02:11:27,588 --> 02:11:31,508
So stupid, that fucking mind. Stupid.

2065
02:11:31,676 --> 02:11:34,135
Jesus Christ.

2066
02:11:36,055 --> 02:11:40,809
What would I think?
Did I think for what I'd done?

2067
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:45,146
She was my wife for 23 years...

2068
02:11:45,314 --> 02:11:50,485
. .. and I went behind her over and over.

2069
02:11:50,653 --> 02:11:54,948
Fucking asshole that I am,
I'd go out and I'd fuck...

2070
02:11:55,116 --> 02:11:58,868
. .. and I'd come home
and get in her bed...

2071
02:11:59,036 --> 02:12:02,664
. .. and say, "I love you. "

2072
02:12:03,791 --> 02:12:06,334
This is Jack's mother.

2073
02:12:07,295 --> 02:12:09,379
His mother, Lily.

2074
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:11,840
These two...

2075
02:12:13,676 --> 02:12:15,552
. .. that I had. . .

2076
02:12:17,805 --> 02:12:19,764
. .. and I lost.

2077
02:12:22,143 --> 02:12:26,896
This is the regret that you make.

2078
02:12:28,065 --> 02:12:29,816
This is the...

2079
02:12:32,695 --> 02:12:36,448
. .. regret that you make
and the something you take. ..

2080
02:12:36,616 --> 02:12:38,700
. .. and the blah, blah, blah...

2081
02:12:40,661 --> 02:12:42,912
Something, something.

2082
02:12:45,791 --> 02:12:48,376
- Give me a cigarette.
- Okay.

2083
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:02,932
Uh. . ..

2084
02:13:15,905 --> 02:13:18,323
Mistakes like this. . .

2085
02:13:19,283 --> 02:13:21,242
. .. you don't make.

2086
02:13:22,745 --> 02:13:24,579
Sometimes. ..

2087
02:13:26,165 --> 02:13:29,793
. .. you make some, and okay.

2088
02:13:30,836 --> 02:13:35,256
Not okay, sometimes,
you make other ones.

2089
02:13:35,424 --> 02:13:37,425
Yeah.

2090
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,345
Know that you should do better.

2091
02:13:43,349 --> 02:13:45,892
I loved Lily.

2092
02:13:48,938 --> 02:13:51,022
I cheated on her.

2093
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:56,069
She was my wife for 23 years.

2094
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:01,991
And I have a son.

2095
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:04,619
And she has cancer.

2096
02:14:05,454 --> 02:14:07,414
And I'm not there...

2097
02:14:07,581 --> 02:14:12,252
. .. and he's forced to take care of her.

2098
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,088
He's 1 4 years old.

2099
02:14:15,256 --> 02:14:16,798
To.. . .

2100
02:14:19,385 --> 02:14:22,429
To take care of his mother and.. . .

2101
02:14:22,972 --> 02:14:26,474
And watch her die on him.

2102
02:14:27,893 --> 02:14:33,148
A little kid, and I'm not there.

2103
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,820
And she does die.

2104
02:14:45,161 --> 02:14:47,787
I loved her so.

2105
02:14:48,831 --> 02:14:50,957
And she knew what I did.

2106
02:14:51,125 --> 02:14:55,962
She knew all the fucking
stupid things I'd done.

2107
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:59,507
But the love...

2108
02:15:00,426 --> 02:15:03,845
...was stronger
than anything you can think of.

2109
02:15:04,889 --> 02:15:07,849
The goddamn regret.

2110
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:11,853
The goddamn regret!

2111
02:15:18,027 --> 02:15:20,028
And I'll die.

2112
02:15:20,196 --> 02:15:25,617
Now I'll die, and I'll tell you what.

2113
02:15:25,785 --> 02:15:29,037
The biggest regret of my life...

2114
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:35,168
I let my love go.

2115
02:15:36,545 --> 02:15:38,797
What did I do?

2116
02:15:41,091 --> 02:15:43,718
I'm 65 years old.

2117
02:15:44,428 --> 02:15:46,721
And I'm ashamed.

2118
02:15:48,265 --> 02:15:50,850
Million years ago...

2119
02:15:52,812 --> 02:15:59,192
The fucking regret and guilt,
these things...

2120
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,570
Don't ever let anyone ever say to you...

2121
02:16:02,738 --> 02:16:05,615
...you shouldn't regret anything.

2122
02:16:06,325 --> 02:16:10,036
Don't do that. Don't. Oh.

2123
02:16:10,204 --> 02:16:13,623
You regret what you fucking want. Ah.

2124
02:16:13,791 --> 02:16:15,291
Use that. Use that.

2125
02:16:15,459 --> 02:16:19,462
Use that regret for anything,
any way you want.

2126
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:21,464
You can use it, okay?

2127
02:16:24,176 --> 02:16:25,593
Oh, God.

2128
02:16:28,556 --> 02:16:31,766
This is a long way to go with no punch.

2129
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:37,146
A little moral...

2130
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:40,733
...story, I say. Ha, ha.

2131
02:16:42,361 --> 02:16:48,908
Love.

2132
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:54,330
This fucking life...

2133
02:16:55,124 --> 02:16:57,083
Oh...

2134
02:16:58,794 --> 02:17:00,962
It's so fucking hard.

2135
02:17:01,672 --> 02:17:04,757
So long.

2136
02:17:04,925 --> 02:17:07,844
Life ain't short. It's long.

2137
02:17:09,555 --> 02:17:12,473
It's long, God damn it.

2138
02:17:14,018 --> 02:17:16,144
Goddamn.

2139
02:17:20,357 --> 02:17:27,655
What did I do?

2140
02:17:27,823 --> 02:17:33,494
What did I do? What did I do?

2141
02:17:33,662 --> 02:17:37,999
Phil. Phil, help me.

2142
02:17:42,046 --> 02:17:44,172
What did I do?

2143
02:17:53,098 --> 02:17:56,309
- Hey, Juan, how you doing?
How you feeling?

2144
02:17:56,477 --> 02:17:59,187
Yeah, I think I'm going to stay on,
stick it out.

2145
02:17:59,355 --> 02:18:00,396
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

2146
02:18:00,564 --> 02:18:03,107
- Okay.
- All right, good night.

2147
02:19:19,518 --> 02:19:21,519
You're so stupid.

2148
02:22:53,982 --> 02:22:55,983
You know, you know, you know.

2149
02:22:56,151 --> 02:22:58,527
Go, go, go.

2150
02:23:00,656 --> 02:23:05,993
- Donnie. Oh, Donnie.
- Hello, dear. I need a favor.

2151
02:23:19,716 --> 02:23:21,175
PH IL:
Okay, okay.

2152
02:23:21,343 --> 02:23:24,345
Shh. All right, all right.
Back up, back up. Back up, Max.

2153
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:26,681
Back up, Miles. Back up.

2154
02:23:28,267 --> 02:23:31,519
- Hello. You Frank? Jack, right?
Hello. How are you?

2155
02:23:31,687 --> 02:23:33,396
Are you Phil?
PH IL: Phil, yeah.

2156
02:23:33,563 --> 02:23:35,690
We, uh, tried to get in touch.
We got disconnected.

2157
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:38,776
Stay in, Max. Stay in. Hey, hey, come on.

2158
02:23:38,944 --> 02:23:41,028
All right? Please.

2159
02:23:41,196 --> 02:23:43,531
I got the message.
- Yeah, I couldn't find you.

2160
02:23:43,699 --> 02:23:46,951
I looked through the address books.
There's no number. There's nothing.

2161
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:52,081
- Shh. Hey!
Is, uh, what's-her-name...?

2162
02:23:52,249 --> 02:23:54,959
PH IL:
Linda? No, she went out. She's not here.

2163
02:23:55,127 --> 02:23:57,712
Hey, I'm sorry, uh. . . .

2164
02:23:57,879 --> 02:24:00,047
You know, I don't know what to do here.

2165
02:24:00,215 --> 02:24:03,551
Um, your dad asked me to get in touch
with you, and I didn't have the number.

2166
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:06,721
You know, I called the number.
Do you wanna come in?

2167
02:24:06,888 --> 02:24:08,889
Yeah. Hey, Phil?
- Okay. Yeah?

2168
02:24:09,057 --> 02:24:12,184
I will drop-kick those fucking
dogs if they come near me.

2169
02:24:12,352 --> 02:24:13,936
PH IL: All right.
- Okay?

2170
02:24:14,104 --> 02:24:17,231
Come on in. Come on in. This is Blake.

2171
02:24:17,399 --> 02:24:20,609
- This is Miles.
Clear them out.

2172
02:24:20,777 --> 02:24:22,611
PH IL:
Here we go.

2173
02:24:23,196 --> 02:24:24,572
All right, he's in here...

2174
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:27,950
. .. so we all go in here. Come on.

2175
02:24:28,118 --> 02:24:29,744
Wanna go in?

2176
02:24:30,746 --> 02:24:34,915
- No, I just- Stand here a second, Phil.
- Okay.

2177
02:24:35,083 --> 02:24:37,168
- Okay?
- All right.

2178
02:25:04,946 --> 02:25:06,447
Lady.

2179
02:25:07,616 --> 02:25:09,367
Hey, lady.

2180
02:25:25,258 --> 02:25:28,636
Lady. Lady.

2181
02:25:28,804 --> 02:25:30,304
Hey, wake up.

2182
02:25:31,556 --> 02:25:33,140
Lady.

2183
02:25:33,767 --> 02:25:35,768
What's wrong with you?

2184
02:26:24,192 --> 02:26:26,360
How do we do this, then?

2185
02:26:28,238 --> 02:26:30,364
Well, we just do it.

2186
02:26:30,949 --> 02:26:34,076
We do it. We figure it out.

2187
02:26:34,244 --> 02:26:37,079
We do as we do, I guess.

2188
02:26:38,707 --> 02:26:40,666
Do you love me, Rose?

2189
02:26:41,460 --> 02:26:44,336
You are my handsome man.

2190
02:26:45,881 --> 02:26:50,509
- I'm a bad person.
- Ha, ha, no. No.

2191
02:26:50,677 --> 02:26:52,470
I mean...

2192
02:26:52,637 --> 02:26:55,222
. .. I'm telling you this now, you see. . ..

2193
02:26:55,765 --> 02:26:58,893
You see, because I want everything
to be clear and clean...

2194
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:02,855
. .. and I want to apologize for me
and all the stupid things that I've done.

2195
02:27:05,984 --> 02:27:08,068
I've cheated on you.

2196
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:14,658
I've cheated on you, and it kills me. . .

2197
02:27:14,826 --> 02:27:17,369
. .. and the guilt of what I've done. ...

2198
02:27:18,038 --> 02:27:20,414
I don't want you to think-

2199
02:27:22,584 --> 02:27:24,418
Maybe you knew.

2200
02:27:25,462 --> 02:27:28,255
I think maybe you've known.

2201
02:27:28,423 --> 02:27:31,967
So I hope this is not just for me. ...

2202
02:27:32,135 --> 02:27:36,430
For me to make myself feel better
about what I've done. . .

2203
02:27:36,598 --> 02:27:41,143
. .. but for you not to feel
like you're sitting there like a jerk.

2204
02:27:41,311 --> 02:27:43,229
You're the good one.

2205
02:27:43,772 --> 02:27:45,439
You understand?

2206
02:27:46,441 --> 02:27:50,694
Did you ever go out
with someone and just lie. . .

2207
02:27:50,862 --> 02:27:53,489
. .. question after question?

2208
02:27:53,657 --> 02:27:55,950
Maybe you're trying
to make yourself look cool. . .

2209
02:27:56,117 --> 02:27:58,494
. .. or better than you are or whatever. . .

2210
02:27:58,662 --> 02:28:01,121
. .. smarter, cooler. . .

2211
02:28:01,289 --> 02:28:03,207
. .. and you just...

2212
02:28:04,918 --> 02:28:06,126
. .. not really lie...

2213
02:28:06,294 --> 02:28:08,921
. .. but maybe
you just don't say everything.

2214
02:28:09,089 --> 02:28:11,090
JIM:
Well, that's a natural thing.

2215
02:28:11,258 --> 02:28:15,719
You know, two people go out
on a date or something...

2216
02:28:15,887 --> 02:28:17,471
. .. they wanna impress people.

2217
02:28:17,639 --> 02:28:19,348
The other person.

2218
02:28:19,516 --> 02:28:21,600
Or they're scared
they might say something...

2219
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:25,271
. .. that will make the other person
not like them.

2220
02:28:26,606 --> 02:28:28,649
- Thank you.
JIM: Thank you.

2221
02:28:29,776 --> 02:28:31,235
So you've done it?

2222
02:28:33,488 --> 02:28:35,155
I don't go out very often.

2223
02:28:35,323 --> 02:28:36,907
Why not?

2224
02:28:39,035 --> 02:28:43,664
I never found someone, really,
that I think I'd like to go out with.

2225
02:28:43,832 --> 02:28:46,792
And I bet you say that
to all the girls, huh?

2226
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:50,462
No. No. Heh.

2227
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:54,842
- Wanna make a deal with me?
- Okay.

2228
02:28:55,010 --> 02:28:56,468
What I just said...

2229
02:28:57,470 --> 02:29:00,014
. .. people afraid to say things. . .

2230
02:29:00,181 --> 02:29:04,351
. .. no guts to say the things
that are real or something.. . .

2231
02:29:04,519 --> 02:29:07,313
- Yeah?
- To not do that.

2232
02:29:07,480 --> 02:29:12,359
To not do that
that maybe we've done before.

2233
02:29:15,614 --> 02:29:18,532
- Let's make a deal.
- Okay.

2234
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:23,829
I'll tell you everything,
and you tell me everything. . .

2235
02:29:23,997 --> 02:29:28,542
. .. and maybe we can get through all the
piss and shit and lies that kill other people.

2236
02:29:31,755 --> 02:29:33,047
Wow.

2237
02:29:34,215 --> 02:29:35,633
Huh. "Piss and shit. "

2238
02:29:37,761 --> 02:29:39,219
What?

2239
02:29:40,221 --> 02:29:42,222
You really use strong language.

2240
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:43,474
I'm sorry.

2241
02:29:44,559 --> 02:29:47,186
No, it's fine. It's fine.

2242
02:29:47,354 --> 02:29:50,022
I didn't mean-
It seems vulgar or something, I know.

2243
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:51,398
- It's fine.
- No, I'm sorry.

2244
02:29:51,566 --> 02:29:54,276
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

2245
02:29:55,403 --> 02:29:58,530
I'm gonna run to the bathroom
for a minute, maybe, just.. . .

2246
02:29:58,698 --> 02:30:00,324
- Okay.
- Okay.

2247
02:31:33,793 --> 02:31:36,670
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

2248
02:31:36,838 --> 02:31:40,090
I'm gonna go in. And, uh. ...
Are the dogs in there?

2249
02:31:40,258 --> 02:31:42,134
Yeah, but they stay back by the window.

2250
02:31:42,302 --> 02:31:44,553
- All right, I want you to come in with me.
- Okay.

2251
02:31:44,721 --> 02:31:46,430
And I want you to stay away from me.

2252
02:31:46,598 --> 02:31:50,726
I want you there in case he needs anything,
because I am not gonna help him.

2253
02:31:51,311 --> 02:31:54,855
And, Phil,
I will drop-kick the fucking dogs. . .

2254
02:31:55,023 --> 02:31:58,484
- . . .if they come near me.
- Okay.

2255
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:20,214
Earl.

2256
02:32:24,219 --> 02:32:26,386
You don't look that bad.

2257
02:32:42,529 --> 02:32:44,404
You prick.

2258
02:32:50,036 --> 02:32:52,663
"Cocksucker. " That's what you
used to like to say, right?

2259
02:32:52,831 --> 02:32:54,623
"Cocksucker. "

2260
02:32:56,084 --> 02:32:59,753
But you are. You're a cocksucker, Earl.

2261
02:32:59,921 --> 02:33:02,881
It hurts, doesn't it? Huh?

2262
02:33:04,843 --> 02:33:06,802
You in a lot of pain?

2263
02:33:08,930 --> 02:33:11,181
She was in a lot of pain.

2264
02:33:13,643 --> 02:33:16,478
Right to the end, she was in a lot of pain.

2265
02:33:19,774 --> 02:33:21,817
I know because I was there, Earl.

2266
02:33:21,985 --> 02:33:24,736
You didn't like illness, though, do you?

2267
02:33:34,038 --> 02:33:35,831
I was there.

2268
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:44,298
She waited for your call.

2269
02:33:47,927 --> 02:33:49,970
For you to come.

2270
02:33:57,645 --> 02:34:00,647
I am not gonna cry.

2271
02:34:02,233 --> 02:34:05,360
I am not gonna cry for you.

2272
02:34:10,867 --> 02:34:13,869
You cocksucker,
I know you can hear me.

2273
02:34:14,037 --> 02:34:17,831
I want you to know
that I hate your fucking guts.

2274
02:34:18,750 --> 02:34:22,711
You can just fucking die, you fuck.

2275
02:34:22,879 --> 02:34:26,465
And I hope it hurts.
I fucking hope it hurts.

2276
02:35:10,551 --> 02:35:14,096
Yeah, her resps are down to six.
Let's get the gurney over here.

2277
02:35:15,223 --> 02:35:18,350
DIXON Check that ego
Come off it, I'm a prophet

2278
02:35:18,518 --> 02:35:21,144
The professor
I'm gonna teach you 'bout the worm

2279
02:35:21,312 --> 02:35:25,816
Who eventually turned to catch wreck
With the neck of a long-time oppressor

2280
02:35:25,984 --> 02:35:29,236
And he's running from the devil
But the debt is always gaining

2281
02:35:29,404 --> 02:35:32,781
And if he's worth being hurt
He's worth bringing pain in

2282
02:35:53,594 --> 02:35:56,221
Do you feel better
now that you've said this?

2283
02:35:57,932 --> 02:35:59,850
JIMMY:
I don't know.

2284
02:36:01,185 --> 02:36:04,855
Well, I'm not mad.

2285
02:36:08,568 --> 02:36:11,486
Well, I am, but I'm not.

2286
02:36:11,654 --> 02:36:13,196
You know?

2287
02:36:16,367 --> 02:36:18,535
I love you so much, Rose.

2288
02:36:18,703 --> 02:36:21,788
I'm not through asking my questions.

2289
02:36:26,377 --> 02:36:28,754
Why doesn't Claudia.. .

2290
02:36:29,505 --> 02:36:31,548
. .. talk to you, Jimmy?

2291
02:36:33,384 --> 02:36:34,968
Why?

2292
02:36:35,762 --> 02:36:37,637
Because we've.. . .

2293
02:36:38,931 --> 02:36:41,099
We both don't know. What do you mean?

2294
02:36:41,267 --> 02:36:43,435
No, I think you know.

2295
02:36:43,603 --> 02:36:45,020
Maybe. . . .

2296
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,440
I don't.

2297
02:36:49,650 --> 02:36:52,069
Say it, Jimmy.

2298
02:37:00,995 --> 02:37:03,914
- I wanted to do that.
JIM: Well...

2299
02:37:04,082 --> 02:37:07,667
- That felt good, to do what I wanted to do.
- Yeah.

2300
02:37:09,295 --> 02:37:11,004
Can I tell you something?

2301
02:37:11,881 --> 02:37:13,131
Yeah, of course.

2302
02:37:13,925 --> 02:37:16,718
I'm really nervous
that you're gonna hate me soon.

2303
02:37:16,886 --> 02:37:19,846
You're gonna find stuff out about me,
and you're gonna hate me.

2304
02:37:20,014 --> 02:37:22,182
No. Like what? What do you mean?

2305
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:26,228
You have so much,
so many good things...

2306
02:37:26,395 --> 02:37:28,355
. .. and you seem so together.

2307
02:37:28,523 --> 02:37:29,940
You're a police officer. . .

2308
02:37:30,108 --> 02:37:34,027
. .. and you seem so straight
and put together, without any problems.

2309
02:37:34,195 --> 02:37:36,738
- I lost my gun today.
- What?

2310
02:37:36,906 --> 02:37:38,240
I lost my gun today...

2311
02:37:38,407 --> 02:37:41,326
. .. and I'm the laughingstock
of a lot of people.

2312
02:37:41,744 --> 02:37:44,371
I wanted to tell you.
I wanted you to know.

2313
02:37:44,539 --> 02:37:46,331
And it's on my mind.

2314
02:37:46,499 --> 02:37:48,583
And it makes me look like a fool.

2315
02:37:48,751 --> 02:37:50,919
And I feel like a fool.

2316
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:56,633
And you asked
that we should say things. . .

2317
02:37:56,801 --> 02:37:59,344
. .. say what we're thinking
and not lie about things.

2318
02:37:59,512 --> 02:38:02,973
Well, I can tell you that. This.
That I lost my gun today.

2319
02:38:03,141 --> 02:38:04,933
I'm not a good cop.

2320
02:38:05,101 --> 02:38:07,394
I'm looked down at, and I know that.. .

2321
02:38:07,562 --> 02:38:11,314
. .. and I'm scared that once
you find that out, you might not like me.

2322
02:38:14,861 --> 02:38:19,614
- Jim, that was so great.
- I'm sorry.

2323
02:38:19,782 --> 02:38:22,075
What you just said.

2324
02:38:25,288 --> 02:38:28,081
I haven't been on a date
since I was married, and.. .

2325
02:38:28,958 --> 02:38:31,585
. .. that was three years ago.

2326
02:38:31,752 --> 02:38:33,753
Claudia, whatever you wanna tell me. . .

2327
02:38:33,921 --> 02:38:36,756
. .. whatever you think
might scare me won't.

2328
02:38:36,924 --> 02:38:38,758
And I will listen to you.

2329
02:38:38,926 --> 02:38:42,429
I'll be a good listener to you
if that's what you want. You know?

2330
02:38:42,597 --> 02:38:44,097
You know? And I won't judge you.

2331
02:38:44,265 --> 02:38:46,850
I know I can do that sometimes,
and I won't.

2332
02:38:47,018 --> 02:38:50,604
And I can listen.

2333
02:38:50,771 --> 02:38:53,773
And you shouldn't be scared
of scaring me off. . .

2334
02:38:53,941 --> 02:38:59,321
. .. or whatever you think
that I think and on and on.

2335
02:38:59,488 --> 02:39:01,364
Say it, whatever it is, and I'll listen.

2336
02:39:01,532 --> 02:39:03,950
- You don't know how fucking stupid I am.
- It's okay.

2337
02:39:04,118 --> 02:39:06,286
- You don't know how crazy I am.
- It's okay.

2338
02:39:06,454 --> 02:39:08,872
- I got troubles.
- I'll take everything at face value.

2339
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:12,167
- I'll be a good listener.
- I started this, didn't I? Didn't I? Fuck.

2340
02:39:12,335 --> 02:39:15,253
Whatever it is, just say it. You'll see.

2341
02:39:15,421 --> 02:39:16,838
You wanna kiss me, Jim?

2342
02:39:17,006 --> 02:39:18,381
Yes, I do.

2343
02:39:21,802 --> 02:39:23,803
Say it, Jimmy.

2344
02:39:26,807 --> 02:39:28,892
I think she thinks...

2345
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:31,603
. .. that I may have molested her.

2346
02:39:33,856 --> 02:39:36,983
She thinks terrible things
that somehow got into her head. . .

2347
02:39:37,151 --> 02:39:39,277
. .. that I may have done.

2348
02:39:39,445 --> 02:39:43,823
She said that to me last time,
when it was...

2349
02:39:46,035 --> 02:39:50,997
Ten years ago, she walked out the door.
"You touched me wrong. I know that. "

2350
02:39:51,165 --> 02:39:57,254
Some crazy thought in her-
In her head.

2351
02:39:58,464 --> 02:40:00,674
Did you ever touch her?

2352
02:40:06,681 --> 02:40:07,764
I don't know.

2353
02:40:12,937 --> 02:40:16,356
- Jimmy.
- I don't know. I really don't.

2354
02:40:18,609 --> 02:40:21,194
But you can't say.

2355
02:40:23,197 --> 02:40:28,785
- Well, I don't know what I've done.
- Yes, you do. You do.

2356
02:40:31,330 --> 02:40:35,250
- But you won't say.
- I don't know.

2357
02:40:35,418 --> 02:40:39,546
What? What? Please. Please.

2358
02:40:39,714 --> 02:40:43,174
You deserve to die alone
for what you've done.

2359
02:40:43,342 --> 02:40:45,135
I don't know what I've done.

2360
02:40:45,303 --> 02:40:47,095
Yes, you do.

2361
02:40:47,263 --> 02:40:50,307
Rose, if I said that I knew,
would you stay?

2362
02:40:50,474 --> 02:40:53,852
- No.
- But I don't know what I've done.

2363
02:40:55,021 --> 02:40:57,230
You should know better.

2364
02:41:03,904 --> 02:41:08,033
Now that I've met you, would you object
to never seeing me again?

2365
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:10,493
- What?
- Just say no.

2366
02:41:10,911 --> 02:41:13,496
- I won't say no. Wait, Claudia.
- Just say no.

2367
02:41:13,664 --> 02:41:16,124
- Claudia, what is it?
- Just let me go, Jimmy.

2368
02:41:16,292 --> 02:41:19,252
- What is it? Please, please.
- Please. It's okay. Just let me go.

2369
02:41:41,317 --> 02:41:43,610
FRANK
Why didn't you call?

2370
02:41:59,293 --> 02:42:02,587
I fucking hate you.

2371
02:42:04,632 --> 02:42:10,261
God damn you, fucking asshole.

2372
02:42:13,474 --> 02:42:15,558
Oh, God, you fucking asshole.

2373
02:42:15,726 --> 02:42:22,982
Don't go away, you fucking asshole.

2374
02:42:23,150 --> 02:42:28,321
Oh, God, don't go away,
you fucking asshole.

2375
02:42:45,089 --> 02:42:47,090
What am I doing?

2376
02:42:47,258 --> 02:42:53,346
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

2377
02:44:32,905 --> 02:44:36,407
Men who are vain
look at their bald spot and say:

2378
02:44:36,575 --> 02:44:40,954
"You know, I don't need anything.
I look great the way I am. "

2379
02:44:41,539 --> 02:44:45,583
Yes. Ladies,
if you want your husband or boyfriend to-

2380
02:45:10,484 --> 02:45:12,569
Oh, fuck.

2381
02:45:33,799 --> 02:45:35,842
JIM:
What?

2382
02:45:39,930 --> 02:45:42,432
What are you doing, dummy?

2383
02:45:43,183 --> 02:45:44,767
Oh, brother.

2384
02:47:56,817 --> 02:47:59,777
Oh, there are frogs falling from the sky.

2385
02:49:01,715 --> 02:49:04,550
You all know
you're not gonna spend $135 for it.

2386
02:49:04,718 --> 02:49:08,763
In fact, all you spend here
during this special TV promotion...

2387
02:49:08,931 --> 02:49:11,057
...is just $39-

2388
02:50:07,489 --> 02:50:09,782
JIM:
Come on. Come on.

2389
02:50:27,718 --> 02:50:30,636
Claudia, it's Mom! Open the door, honey!

2390
02:50:30,804 --> 02:50:34,390
Claudia! Claudia, are you there?

2391
02:50:35,142 --> 02:50:38,644
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mommy!

2392
02:50:38,812 --> 02:50:41,606
Oh, honey. All right. It's all right.

2393
02:50:41,773 --> 02:50:43,816
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

2394
02:50:56,580 --> 02:50:58,581
This happens.

2395
02:50:58,749 --> 02:51:07,840
This is something that happens.

2396
02:52:26,044 --> 02:52:28,921
And there is the account
of the hanging of three men...

2397
02:52:30,048 --> 02:52:31,882
...and a scuba diver...

2398
02:52:32,050 --> 02:52:33,551
...and a suicide.

2399
02:52:43,061 --> 02:52:46,772
There are stories
of coincidence and chance...

2400
02:52:46,940 --> 02:52:50,067
...and intersections,
and strange things told...

2401
02:52:50,235 --> 02:52:53,738
...and which is which,
and who only knows?

2402
02:52:58,285 --> 02:53:00,119
And we generally say:

2403
02:53:00,287 --> 02:53:02,997
"Well, if that was in a movie,
I wouldn't believe it. "

2404
02:53:03,165 --> 02:53:07,877
Someone's so-and-so
met someone else's so-and-so, and so on.

2405
02:53:08,045 --> 02:53:10,921
And it is in the humble opinion
of this narrator...

2406
02:53:11,089 --> 02:53:13,716
...that strange things happen all the time.

2407
02:53:13,884 --> 02:53:15,718
And so it goes, and so it goes.

2408
02:53:15,886 --> 02:53:17,803
And the book says:

2409
02:53:17,971 --> 02:53:19,972
"We may be through with the past...

2410
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:23,267
...but the past ain't through with us. "

2411
02:53:27,147 --> 02:53:29,315
PH IL:
I'm sorry, Jack.

2412
02:53:29,483 --> 02:53:32,318
It's the hospital calling about Linda.

2413
02:53:32,486 --> 02:53:35,529
- Who?
- Linda. She's in the hospital...

2414
02:53:35,697 --> 02:53:40,076
. .. and I figured you should probably
talk to them since you're here.

2415
02:53:41,203 --> 02:53:42,787
Hello?

2416
02:53:44,122 --> 02:53:45,873
Uh-huh. And what-

2417
02:53:47,834 --> 02:53:50,628
Okay. Okay.

2418
02:53:50,796 --> 02:53:52,171
Uh. . ..

2419
02:53:52,339 --> 02:53:54,673
Is she gonna be all right?

2420
02:53:58,470 --> 02:54:00,054
Where...?

2421
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:24,328
You with us, Linda? Good.

2422
02:54:24,496 --> 02:54:26,705
It is Linda, isn't it?

2423
02:54:31,044 --> 02:54:34,463
Just relax. That's it.

2424
02:54:36,133 --> 02:54:38,175
You'll get through this.

2425
02:54:49,437 --> 02:54:51,063
Dad.

2426
02:54:54,276 --> 02:54:55,776
Dad.

2427
02:54:58,738 --> 02:55:01,240
Dad, you need to be nicer to me.

2428
02:55:03,535 --> 02:55:05,161
Go to bed.

2429
02:55:06,413 --> 02:55:09,039
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.

2430
02:55:12,878 --> 02:55:14,461
Go to bed.

2431
02:55:22,971 --> 02:55:25,806
I know I did a stupid thing.

2432
02:55:26,558 --> 02:55:28,809
So stupid.

2433
02:55:28,977 --> 02:55:31,312
Getting braces.

2434
02:55:31,479 --> 02:55:33,189
I thought... .

2435
02:55:34,774 --> 02:55:36,775
I thought he would love me.

2436
02:55:36,943 --> 02:55:39,862
Getting braces.

2437
02:55:40,030 --> 02:55:41,113
For what?

2438
02:55:41,281 --> 02:55:45,409
For something I don't even. . . .

2439
02:55:47,454 --> 02:55:50,497
I don't know where to put things,
you know?

2440
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:56,712
I really do have love to give.

2441
02:55:56,880 --> 02:56:00,382
I just don't know where to put it.

2442
02:56:09,851 --> 02:56:13,562
A lot of people think this
is just a job that you go to.

2443
02:56:15,273 --> 02:56:18,567
Take a lunch hour. Job's over.

2444
02:56:18,735 --> 02:56:20,527
Something like that.

2445
02:56:22,447 --> 02:56:25,032
JIM:
But it's a 24-hour deal.

2446
02:56:27,077 --> 02:56:29,161
No two ways about it.

2447
02:56:30,288 --> 02:56:33,666
And what most people don't see...

2448
02:56:35,085 --> 02:56:39,004
...is just how hard it is
to do the right thing.

2449
02:56:42,133 --> 02:56:44,009
People think if I make a judgment call...

2450
02:56:44,177 --> 02:56:47,721
...that that's a judgment on them,
but that is not what I do.

2451
02:56:49,015 --> 02:56:51,350
And that's not what should be done.

2452
02:56:53,228 --> 02:56:55,854
I have to take everything...

2453
02:56:56,022 --> 02:56:58,357
...and play as it lays.

2454
02:57:03,029 --> 02:57:05,531
Sometimes people need a little help.

2455
02:57:05,699 --> 02:57:09,034
- supposed to be real good
at corrective oral surgery.

2456
02:57:13,790 --> 02:57:16,667
JIM:
Sometimes people need to be forgiven.

2457
02:57:23,341 --> 02:57:25,801
And sometimes they need to go to jail.

2458
02:57:27,220 --> 02:57:30,055
Call me about that guy
with the teeth, okay?

2459
02:57:31,308 --> 02:57:34,310
JIM:
And that is a very tricky thing on my part...

2460
02:57:36,187 --> 02:57:38,105
...making that call.

2461
02:57:41,901 --> 02:57:44,236
I mean, the law is the law...

2462
02:57:45,322 --> 02:57:47,865
...and heck if I'm gonna break it.

2463
02:57:54,914 --> 02:57:57,291
JIM:
You can forgive someone.

2464
02:58:04,507 --> 02:58:06,592
Well, that's the tough part.

2465
02:58:12,515 --> 02:58:14,767
What can we forgive?

2466
02:58:26,029 --> 02:58:28,113
Tough part of the job.

2467
02:58:31,618 --> 02:58:34,203
Tough part of walking down the street.

2468
02:59:31,553 --> 02:59:33,804
JIM:
I just wanted to come here...

2469
02:59:34,848 --> 02:59:37,266
To come here and say something.

2470
02:59:37,767 --> 02:59:40,978
Say something important.
Something that you said.

2471
02:59:42,063 --> 02:59:45,190
You said we should say things
and do things.

2472
02:59:45,358 --> 02:59:48,569
Not lie, not keep things back.

2473
02:59:48,736 --> 02:59:50,654
These are the things that tear people up.

2474
02:59:50,822 --> 02:59:52,865
Well, I'm gonna do that.

2475
02:59:53,992 --> 02:59:56,618
I'm gonna do what you said, Claudia.

2476
02:59:58,788 --> 03:00:01,540
I can't let this go.

2477
03:00:03,042 --> 03:00:05,043
I can't let you go.

2478
03:00:09,966 --> 03:00:11,717
Now, you...

2479
03:00:13,720 --> 03:00:15,888
You listen to me now.

2480
03:00:17,932 --> 03:00:20,267
You're a good person.

2481
03:00:22,479 --> 03:00:24,938
A good, beautiful person...

2482
03:00:25,106 --> 03:00:27,733
. .. and I won't let you walk out on me.

2483
03:00:29,652 --> 03:00:32,237
I won't let you say those things.

2484
03:00:32,989 --> 03:00:36,658
Those things about how stupid you are
and this and that.

2485
03:00:37,744 --> 03:00:40,120
I won't stand for that.

2486
03:00:42,373 --> 03:00:44,583
You want to be with me.. .

2487
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:49,421
. .. then you be with me.

2488
03:00:52,091 --> 03:00:53,717
You see?

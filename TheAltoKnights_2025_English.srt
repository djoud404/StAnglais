1
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,813
- Norvel.
- Good evening, Mr. Costello.

2
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,498
This one's
for you, Frank.

3
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,127
This one's
for you, Frank.

4
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,768
Mr. Costello!
Mr. Costello!

5
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,895
I'm calling an ambulance.

6
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,527
I should've been
paying more attention

7
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,529
instead of taking
bows at the Copa.

8
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,116
♪ Then that elevator
Starts its ride ♪

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,161
- ♪ Down and down I go ♪
- ♪ Round and round I go ♪

10
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,081
♪ Like a leaf
Caught in a tide ♪

11
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,334
♪ I should stay away
But what can I do? ♪

12
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,920
Till I got
shot in the head,

13
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,215
I don't think people even
realized I was a rackets guy.

14
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:16,762
I didn't carry a gun. I had
no bodyguards. I took cabs.

15
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,018
I was married to the
same woman for 38 years.

16
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,688
And whenever I was
mentioned in the papers

17
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,231
for some charity
or political thing,

18
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:31,277
I was usually referred to
as a professional gambler.

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,321
A Damon Runyon type of guy.

20
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,740
Guys and Dolls and all
that sort of stuff.

21
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,332
They're on the last song.

22
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,250
Good.

23
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,044
But then years
later, my best friend,

24
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,672
he betrayed me.

25
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,966
Vito, the show's almost over.

26
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,977
Vito and me,
we grew up together.

27
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,770
You wouldn't know
it, but back then

28
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,982
we were very good
friends and very close.

29
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,109
And we quit our regular
school the ninth grade,

30
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,612
not because we were dumb, but
because we were ambitious.

31
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,196
And the Alto Knights Social Club

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,073
was where we hung out.

33
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,617
It was our home.

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,580
We weren't gonna go dig
ditches like our fathers

35
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,329
and live upstairs in
a cold-water tenement

36
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,332
for the rest of our
lives. No, sir, not us.

37
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,085
We lived in America. America
was the land of opportunity.

38
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,171
Yankee Doodle
Dandy and all that.

39
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,255
But when Lucky

40
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,340
got into politics,

41
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,966
everything changed.

42
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,678
Especially after Tammany
saw those immigrants

43
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,305
who never bothered to vote,

44
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,390
that they were
election day gold.

45
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,185
Vito and I just told
everybody in Italian,

46
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,728
"Vote for the donkey."

47
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,023
I remember one
time telling Vito,

48
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,275
"Hey, maybe we can open
a restaurant or a bar.

49
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,611
What do you think?" He
said, "Nah. Not interested."

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,696
- Gotta consider this.
- Listen...

51
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,075
- I'm not joking.
- I take out. I don't put in.

52
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,911
And that was the
first time I realized,

53
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,162
"We don't think the same."

54
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,248
Take a bow.

55
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,875
At first
I wasn't too sure

56
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,585
about taking bows
and all that stuff.

57
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,878
It wasn't for me.

58
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,964
After a while, I
gotta say, I liked it.

59
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,132
Commissioner!
Right here. Right here!

60
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,050
Mr. Hawley, as head

61
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,527
of the Fifth Avenue
Businessmen's Association,

62
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,271
how do you find working
with Frank Costello?

63
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,823
All I know is that
I would hope to have

64
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,889
Frank Costello's support

65
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,432
in every one of
our charity events.

66
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,059
You go ahead with Gene and Lois,

67
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,286
I'll meet youse
at the restaurant.

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,704
I gotta do some stuff
at the apartment.

69
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,897
Okay. Honey, don't...
don't be long.

70
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,232
It was a lovely affair,

71
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,567
and I've never met so many
judges in all my life.

72
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,485
I won't be long.

73
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,208
It's not like they're
a barrel of monkeys.

74
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,321
You'll be all right.

75
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,785
Sometimes I would
forget I wasn't running

76
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,203
a regular
billion-dollar business.

77
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,081
In fact, I was even thinking
of getting out, but...

78
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,959
I didn't see this coming.

79
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,672
Doctor
Roberts, call extension 16.

80
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,217
Doctor Roberts, please
call extension 16.

81
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,513
Mr. Costello,
you're a lucky man.

82
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,307
The bullet pierced your scalp
just behind your right ear,

83
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,476
and then instead of
penetrating your skull,

84
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,104
it miraculously curved
round the back of your head

85
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,064
until exiting near
your left ear.

86
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,900
You'll have headaches and
be forgetful for a few days,

87
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:17,985
but you should be fine.

88
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,319
Uh, thanks, Doc.

89
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,657
I didn't want you to come here.

90
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,660
I don't always do what you want.

91
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,745
I know, I know...

92
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,997
You heard him. I'm gonna
be fine, it's all right.

93
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,832
What happens now?

94
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,584
Nothing.

95
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,128
I got the message.

96
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:37,962
That's it.

97
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,091
I'm done. I'm done.

98
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,469
You're done?

99
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,181
I know what to do.

100
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,891
What does... What
does that mean?

101
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,019
I don't understand
what you're saying.

102
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,022
Go home. I'll see
you at home, okay?

103
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,273
Okay, baby.

104
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
All right.

105
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,860
Orderlies,

106
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,820
please report to
the business lounge.

107
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,740
Could orderlies please report
to the business lounge?

108
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,508
Come on. Inside.

109
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,972
Mr. Costello, I'm
Detective Salerno.

110
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,516
This is Detective Jim Mullins.

111
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,476
You must have seen who shot you.

112
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,619
Called out your name, Frank.

113
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,622
Okay, yeah, no. He did, you're
right. But I turned around.

114
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,875
And when I turned around,
I was shot and I went down.

115
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,919
I hit the floor, and when I...

116
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,172
By the time I saw who it was,
the guy was out the door.

117
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:03,966
What happened?

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,801
You walked away.

119
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,764
All you had to do was
that, and you walked away.

120
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,388
No. That's not what happened.

121
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,806
Then what did happen?

122
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,474
All you had to do
was finish him off.

123
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,601
You're supposed to finish
what you started doing.

124
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,645
That's what you're
supposed to do. Vincent.

125
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,188
I did finish. I
was two feet away.

126
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,857
The fucking bullet
bounced off his head.

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,626
You know this isn't over.
These guys are gonna

128
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,169
come back for you.
You know that, right?

129
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,528
Well, I don't know...

130
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,363
I don't have enemies,
as far as I know.

131
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,699
I got a pretty
good... I know that

132
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,951
- you might not believe me.
- I wish I could say that.

133
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,874
You had to use a fucking
pop gun. A peashooter.

134
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,497
- What's the matter with you?
- I didn't wanna make noise.

135
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,041
Noise? It's a fucking gun.
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,335
- But I was close to him.
- It's a fucking gun.

137
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,462
It's supposed to make noise.
Are you stupid or what?

138
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,964
I yelled out his
name to be sure.

139
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,847
Called his name? So what?
What does that mean?

140
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,467
What's this, Frank?

141
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,679
- What is that? You just put...
- This is dated just last week.

142
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,641
It says, "Gross casino wins.
Less markers. $434,000."

143
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,810
- That's a lot of money.
- Frank, you have a casino?

144
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,979
Where's the casino?
Is it in Las Vegas?

145
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,231
I don't know what you're
talking about or what that is.

146
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,067
...shoot somebody in the head,
you'd think that they're dead.

147
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,612
You don't think
they're dead. You shot oogatz.

148
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,947
You see them go down? Does
that mean they're dead? No.

149
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,324
You gotta go see
if they're dead.

150
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,367
You gotta shoot 'em
again, again, again.

151
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,077
You shoot and you
ask questions later,

152
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,455
- but you make sure he's dead.
- I thought he was dead.

153
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,708
He's not dead. He's not dead.
Guess what. He's not dead.

154
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,336
I mean, I didn't know it was
legal for you guys to just...

155
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,253
Without a warrant...

156
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,714
Just go and pick something
out of my pocket like that.

157
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,517
You didn't see I picked
it up off the floor?

158
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,485
- Must've fell on the floor.
- I didn't see that.

159
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,820
- Frank...
- Is that what happened?

160
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,804
...you might as well
tell us what it is.

161
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,264
What's going on here, Frank?

162
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,988
You know and I know
you know who did this.

163
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,778
If you guys know, then
go after those people

164
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,120
because I don't
know who they are.

165
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,064
It was co... It was
coming out of his head.

166
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,625
It's supposed to
come out of his head.

167
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,943
When you shoot a person in
the head, you think he's dead.

168
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,444
Gotta shoot 'em again.

169
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,612
- Come on.
- Fuck.

170
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,489
Well, obviously, we
need a witness, right?

171
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,449
You're the victim. You
were shot in the head.

172
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,744
Frank, you had to see him.
All we need is a name, Frank.

173
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,039
The elevator door was gonna...
was gonna open, and I...

174
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,123
There was a lot of blood.

175
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,792
How did I know what
was gonna happen?

176
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,253
You gotta get outta here
now. You gotta take off.

177
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,546
Get lost for a while.
You know what to do.

178
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,966
Make yourself scarce.

179
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,926
Fellas, I would
like to help you,

180
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,095
but I cannot do that
because I don't know who...

181
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,930
I didn't see anything.

182
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,057
I didn't see who it
w... I saw a blur.

183
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,310
I just don't have any more
informa... I'm sorry, you know?

184
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,937
I don't know what to tell you.

185
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,274
You don't want me to
go to the hospital?

186
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,984
- Come on. Come on.
- Shoot him again?

187
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,107
Stop being a fucking jerk.

188
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,820
I can't believe I
just heard him say

189
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,063
that he fucking wants to
shoot him now at the hospital.

190
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,341
What's the matter with this kid?

191
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,784
What, we gotta give him a
fucking bazooka next time?

192
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,011
- I don't understand.
- Who cares?

193
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,996
He did all that practice.
Who gives a fuck?

194
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,914
He was practicing upstate
doing all this shit.

195
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,041
He was telling me, "I'm
practicing, shooting..."

196
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,543
The fuck? You
didn't do nothing.

197
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,965
I mean, I'd like to call
my lawyer if I could.

198
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,717
Yeah, go
ahead. Be my guest.

199
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,926
All right.

200
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,732
Frank Costello, the city's
reputed rackets boss

201
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,859
and a political powerhouse,
known around town as

202
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,169
"the Prime Minister"
of the underworld...

203
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,213
- How did it go wrong?
- ...survived a murder attempt

204
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,573
as he entered his luxury
Central Park West apartment.

205
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,576
Police say the gunman, who
used a .32 caliber revolver,

206
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,537
is in his mid-twenties and
fled in a sedan with a driver.

207
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:50,609
Police are concerned

208
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,778
that the botched attempt
on Costello's life

209
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,072
could be a sign of rivalry
in gangland circles.

210
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,156
We know there's trouble

211
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,116
between your client
and Vito Genovese.

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,118
Frank, there's been
rumors about it for years.

213
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,842
Let me tell you
something, boys and girls.

214
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,747
I'm here at Lindy's,
and this isn't something

215
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,541
that you can brush off with
cheesecake and blintzes.

216
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,043
Gentlemen, need I remind you

217
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,170
that Mr. Costello is
the victim in this case?

218
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,339
He's the one that
was shot, all right?

219
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,425
So unless you're charging
the victim with the crime,

220
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,551
I think we're finished.

221
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,404
Hey, Frank,
who do you think did it?

222
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,323
I can tell
you there's great concern

223
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,141
among officials that the
Costello shooting could lead

224
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,851
to the kind of bloody mob war

225
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,175
this city hasn't seen in years.

226
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,062
Hey, Frank!

227
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,855
I know
it's got City Hall

228
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,065
and the police commissioner

229
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,110
at 240 Centre Street
plenty worried.

230
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,903
This is Victor Riesel.

231
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,119
Mr. Costello!
Right here. Frank!

232
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,578
Frank! Frank, right here.

233
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,496
Wait for me.

234
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,249
Frank, do me a favor.
No comment, huh?

235
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,750
What you gotta say, Frank?

236
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,503
Hey, hey, hey.
Back up. Hey, hey.

237
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,467
We have no comment at
this time. No comment.

238
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,761
Please respect
Mr. Costello's privacy

239
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,972
while he recovers from
his injuries, all right?

240
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,890
Come on, boys. Give us
a night off, all right?

241
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,189
Let's take off.

242
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,400
What good's
it gonna do now?

243
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,943
A lot.

244
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:03,074
It'll get us dinner
in Rome. Hmm?

245
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,827
I just, I... You
know... I wanna...

246
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,705
- We gotta come back anyway.
- Why? Why?

247
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,333
- Because I s...
- No, it's just you and me.

248
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,626
That was our deal.

249
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,545
We are our own family.

250
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,631
We could live anywhere.

251
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,718
You're right, I know. But
I gotta finish this here.

252
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,595
Gotta finish what's going on.

253
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,223
I have to deal with it.
I gotta... I gotta...

254
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,183
I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do.

255
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,685
You promised me. We
were our own family.

256
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,980
And you, me, the dogs, we
can... we can live anywhere.

257
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,315
We're gonna do that.

258
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,443
I decided, after this, I'm done.

259
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,945
But I gotta deal
with this stuff.

260
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,781
I gotta make sure everything
is okay before we go,

261
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,492
and then we're out. I'm
out, that's it. Done. Over.

262
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,996
But now, I'm worried.
I gotta finish this.

263
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,290
We might not be
that lucky again.

264
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,169
If it
wasn't for Bobbie,

265
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,005
I probably would've never
left the neighborhood.

266
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,675
Nobody ever left
the neighborhood.

267
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,762
It's where we all felt
safe. Comfortable.

268
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,348
We looked out for each other.

269
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,394
It was Bobbie who showed me
there was more to the city

270
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,897
than just Downtown, the club
and everything down there.

271
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,817
All those memories.

272
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,362
We picked a neutral
turf for the wedding

273
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,239
since her mother
and father thought

274
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,075
their 17-year-old daughter,
Loretta Geigerman,

275
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,995
should not marry an
Italian stickup man.

276
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,205
And my mother and father,
they couldn't figure out

277
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,000
why I wasn't marrying
a nice Italian girl

278
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,335
instead of this Jewish
wiseass girl, you know.

279
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,445
Why do you walk
around with that all the time?

280
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,508
I wish you wouldn't carry a gun.

281
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,011
You know, if they catch
you, it's five years.

282
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,846
Nobody is gonna catch me.

283
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,806
I caught you.

284
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,475
Yeah, well, that's
'cause I kissed you.

285
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,854
And I do not kiss cops.

286
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,614
I got picked up

287
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,531
on a gun charge

288
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,449
right after the wedding.

289
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,784
I spent the rest of
my honeymoon in jail.

290
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,079
I never carried a gun again.

291
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:17,167
Tammany judge got me 11
months on Welfare Island.

292
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,585
And I got a dorm with a guy

293
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,086
who helped fix

294
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,755
the 1919 World Series.

295
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,007
He said everybody in the country

296
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,467
could drink all they wanted,

297
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
but nobody was
supposed to sell it.

298
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,139
I couldn't believe this law.

299
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,521
For me, Prohibition

300
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,731
was the new frontier.

301
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,316
God bless America.

302
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,328
♪ Any bootlegger Sure
is a pal of mine ♪

303
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,830
Prohibition was a law
that nobody wanted to obey

304
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,123
and nobody wanted to enforce,

305
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,667
and that suited me fine.

306
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,808
When the doctor
said having a baby

307
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,101
would endanger Bobbie's life,

308
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,311
my business became my family.

309
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,813
I spent Prohibition

310
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,524
turning politicians
and cops into partners.

311
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,070
I turned speakeasies
into supper clubs

312
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,657
and crap games into casinos.

313
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,201
I provided the best
imported Scotch available

314
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,744
to the city's upper classes.

315
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,374
Vito became the top boss when
Lucky went to prison in 1937.

316
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,919
Unfortunately, Vito got
involved in a double homicide,

317
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,171
so he turned
everything over to me.

318
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,424
And he decided to skip
out of the country.

319
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,094
That was his way of
avoiding the grand jury,

320
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,054
so we threw him a
bon-voyage party

321
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,181
on the boat before he
sailed off to Italy.

322
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,185
And so then I was, suddenly,
the boss of bosses.

323
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,229
At his going-away
party, he told everybody

324
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,690
he was leaving me in
charge till he got back

325
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,649
because he knew...

326
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,901
he knew he could trust me

327
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,820
and I wouldn't try
to steal from him.

328
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,155
And he was right.

329
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,614
I would never do that.

330
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,951
But World War II happened,

331
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,995
and he got stuck
over there for years.

332
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,971
By the time he got back,
the whole world had changed.

333
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,934
Mr. Genovese.

334
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,061
Over the course of your life,

335
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,939
including the years when you
were a fugitive overseas,

336
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,027
every witness against you has
either died or disappeared.

337
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,112
And more recently, last week,

338
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:55,033
a witness under the protective
custody of this court died

339
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,743
after drinking a cup of coffee

340
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,621
with enough arsenic
to kill eight horses.

341
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,581
I cannot speak for a jury,

342
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,292
but I would gladly condemn
you to the electric chair.

343
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,586
If I could.

344
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,547
Case dismissed.

345
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,551
Vito.

346
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,804
Hey. Welcome home.

347
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,181
When Vito beat the
double homicide,

348
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,100
the bosses gave him a
party at the Alto Knights.

349
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,854
They were all there.
Even Richie Boiardo,

350
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,815
the New York-Jersey
boss, was there.

351
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:30,360
Boiardo was like the umpire
for the New York bosses.

352
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,611
Everybody liked him.

353
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,239
Joe Bonanno from the Bronx.

354
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,865
Tommy Lucchese from Queens.

355
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,993
Joe Profaci from Brooklyn.

356
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,996
Albert Anastasia, who ran
the Brooklyn waterfront,

357
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,320
even though the newspapers said

358
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,166
he ran Murder, Incorporated.

359
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,835
And there was Tony Bender,

360
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,046
Vito's closest confidant,
friend, consigliere, whatever.

361
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,173
In that crowd,
including Richie Boy,

362
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,758
Albert was the
best friend I had.

363
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,386
Welcome home, Vito.

364
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,849
Where's Frank? Frank not here?

365
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,572
- Who? No, he's not here.
- He ain't here.

366
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,602
He don't come around too much.

367
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,687
What happened?

368
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,231
He's supposed to be
here. He's the boss.

369
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,607
He's supposed to be here, right?

370
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,860
Think he should
be here, yeah. But...

371
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,028
He doesn't wanna
attract too much heat.

372
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,990
Vito had been gone
a long time. Too long.

373
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,075
He expected to take
over his old spot again

374
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,243
as the boss of bosses,

375
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,078
but the commission
ruled against it.

376
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,164
That's over 60 top bosses
from all around the country

377
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,585
who enjoyed 15 years
of peace, prosperity,

378
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,629
friendly politicians,
with me at the top.

379
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,214
And they didn't want no changes.

380
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,966
Especially after it got around

381
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,676
that Vito was dealing
drugs in Italy.

382
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,678
Two murder raps, and
you're walking home.

383
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,263
- Huh?
- Two murder raps.

384
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,515
You beat the both of them.

385
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,851
I mean, between us, he should
have fucking been here...

386
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,768
Of course, of course.

387
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,332
But tomorrow you go
and meet with him.

388
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,939
I gotta beg him for stuff
that's already mines.

389
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,441
- You don't.
- That's what I'm...

390
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,526
There comes a time
when you gotta use

391
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,736
a little bit of diplomacy.

392
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,820
You know what I mean?

393
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,740
Just be nice. Firm, but nice.

394
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,201
Yeah, I know, right.
Bullshit. Yeah. I mean,

395
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,287
with all these fucking
judges and all that shit.

396
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,748
I mean, those judges, they
gave me fucking nothing.

397
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,626
Oogatz. They gave me fucking
ooga... They gave me nothing.

398
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,879
Vito, you beat it without him.
You didn't need him. Fuck him.

399
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,602
Will you listen to me?
He gave me nothing.

400
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,841
- Nothing.
- I know he... You're right.

401
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,217
Proud cocksucker, you.

402
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,136
I know, I know. You're right.

403
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,180
I come back, he don't
show no respect.

404
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,974
- He'd be here, but with me.
- Of course he should be here.

405
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,353
He's afraid of cops. He's
afraid of taking a pinch.

406
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,104
His wife has got
him by the balls.

407
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,440
He knows I'm here. He
should've been here.

408
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,443
Bad move. They should have
been here. Absolutely.

409
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,114
For me and
Vito to have this talk,

410
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,533
I figured, "Let's go to
Dora's Candy Store. Why not?"

411
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,910
It's a place we knew as kids.

412
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,578
We hung out there all the time.

413
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,455
Had all kinds of
things going on.

414
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,290
It would help.

415
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,126
But I also knew
Vito, and I also knew

416
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,088
that if he didn't
get what he wanted,

417
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,172
he would try to take it.

418
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,803
Sorry I couldn't be there
for your thing at the club.

419
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,722
I thought it was better
if I wasn't there.

420
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,098
I didn't wanna draw attention.

421
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:50,226
It was nice. It was good to
see everybody all home...

422
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,787
- It's all right. Don't worry.
- Must've been.

423
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,871
- It was nice.
- Yeah, nice.

424
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,106
No, I'm glad you had
a good time. So...

425
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,483
So what do you think?
What do you want to do?

426
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,112
First of all, I'm thinking,

427
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,614
"Give me everything that
I lost while I was away."

428
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,200
Vito, you've been gone a long
time. Everything's changed.

429
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,286
- It ain't the same.
- I know. I understand.

430
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,662
Look, you did good by everybody.

431
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,206
God bless you. You made a lot
of money for a lot of people.

432
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,126
Didn't include me, but that's
okay. What am I gonna do?

433
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,063
- Well, that's why we're here.
- Yeah, that's why we're here.

434
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,887
That's why I gotta start
looking for something

435
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,026
to get me back to where I was
like the old days 'cause...

436
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,927
You gave me Downtown and
the West Side, that's good.

437
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,305
But that ain't enough. It
ain't doing it. I need more.

438
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,348
You know, when I left
I gave you everything.

439
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,672
And so, we gotta work that out.

440
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,393
Otherwise I gotta look
for something else

441
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,729
- to get me back where I was.
- Well, I'm hoping I...

442
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm hoping that you're not
thinking what I'm thinking,

443
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,442
because that wouldn't
be good for anybody.

444
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,236
There were some people that
are looking to go that way.

445
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,322
These people I'm talking
to. And they're looking...

446
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,450
I know who you're talking
to. With those fellas,

447
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,869
you're looking for trouble,
I gotta be honest with you.

448
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,246
Right now, we're
doing very nicely

449
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,956
with what we got. Right now.

450
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,085
Let me just... Let's
work something out.

451
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,629
Let me just think about this.
Let me come up with something.

452
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,548
Something that would be better
for you, better for everybody.

453
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,676
You understand?
Let's try that first.

454
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,804
Let's not jump into anything.

455
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,263
Let's try to be
smart about this.

456
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,067
Just give me a little
time. I'll find a way.

457
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,018
But if you go that way,
you're gonna create problems

458
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,145
for a lot of people.
They're gonna get hurt.

459
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,189
That, I will guarantee you.

460
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,690
That, we have to watch out for.

461
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,734
All right. Well, the
people who I'm talking to,

462
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,069
they ain't against it.

463
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,905
They got no problem with
it. They're very interested.

464
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,199
- That means something to me.
- They're okay with it,

465
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,576
but it's not okay if
you're okay with it.

466
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,161
There's gonna be a big problem.

467
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,247
No, no. No, no, no.

468
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,499
No, no, no, no.

469
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,583
Go.

470
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,502
Frank, listen.

471
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:43,047
With Scotch, that didn't
stop you from selling.

472
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,298
It was supply and demand.

473
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,842
Nobody knows this
better than you.

474
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,469
Supply and demand.
They demand, we supply.

475
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,097
- It's the same thing.
- It ain't the same. Come on.

476
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,891
Nah, it ain't the same.
There's more money in it.

477
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,434
There's a lot more money in it.

478
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,894
In the old days,

479
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,438
a truck full of Scotch
got you a $50 fine.

480
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:00,731
The cops would drive you home

481
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,525
after you paid
them a little bit.

482
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,194
This... You get pinched
with an ounce of that stuff,

483
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,195
you can get 20 to life.

484
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,923
What are you talking
about? It's not the same.

485
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,507
And they know what's
going on in Turkey.

486
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,075
They know what's
going on in Marseille

487
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,952
with the Corsicans, and Palermo.

488
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,080
They know, and they've got
a list of over 115 names.

489
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,707
You can't be on that list.

490
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,418
I don't want you on that
list. You can't be on it.

491
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,253
What, are you... What,
are you a lawyer now?

492
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,839
No, I'm not a lawyer, but
I listen to the lawyers.

493
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,507
And they advise me
in their own way

494
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,593
what I can do, what I cannot do.

495
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,636
And that is something I
cannot do. It's a no-no.

496
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,684
It's a no-no.

497
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,895
This sfogliatella.
This sfogliatella,

498
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,189
it's like it's been here
for a hundred years.

499
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,609
All right, let's
talk about it later.

500
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,047
That's good, Benny.

501
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,388
Hey, who's that? Huh?

502
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,098
It's Anna Viggio.

503
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,810
She has the Zebra Club. That
joint over on 8th Street.

504
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,938
You mean the lesbian-gay joint?

505
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,665
- The after-hour joint?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,275
She stole it from her
husband during their divorce.

507
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,819
It was during the
war. You were away.

508
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:29,737
Who bought this?

509
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,798
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna take a walk home.

510
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,550
- Wait. Where you going?
- I'll see you soon.

511
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:34,574
I wanna say hello.

512
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:39,789
Hey, Benny.

513
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,583
- Take care of the lady?
- Absolutely.

514
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,102
You're not trying to
rob her or nothing?

515
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,170
- No, sir. I will. Yes.
- Gonna treat her right.

516
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,047
My name is Vito.

517
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,050
I know exactly who you are.

518
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,094
I don't know if that's
good or bad, but...

519
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,096
- I say it's good.
- Good.

520
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,931
What a melon.

521
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,975
You know how to
pick out a melon?

522
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,310
Yeah, no, it's gotta be hard.

523
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,145
If it's soft, it's not good.

524
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,946
You own that club?
The after-hours joint?

525
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,781
- I do.
- Yeah?

526
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,676
- You should come by one night.
- Maybe I will.

527
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,326
You know, I'll come
after you, you know,

528
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,578
make dinner for me
one day. One night.

529
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,097
You'll make it up.

530
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,563
My talk with
Vito at the candy store

531
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,898
fell on deaf
ears. No surprise.

532
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,734
You see, he just
ignored my warnings.

533
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,778
And he just kept making his
business bigger and bigger

534
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,739
and creating more
and more problems.

535
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,240
...come in, they
think they're going

536
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,242
to fucking Macy's or something.

537
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:01,078
Making signals like he's
fucking buying me ice cream.

538
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,455
You want me to go?

539
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,415
No, no, no. Stay here.
Don't do nothing.

540
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,793
I can't believe you
did this for me!

541
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,004
Oh, my God, this is gorgeous!

542
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,898
One of the
largest dope smuggling rings

543
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,215
of recent years is smashed.

544
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,551
- How do I look?
- Great. Don't run me over.

545
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,678
Seized heroin
and opium is the nucleus

546
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,264
of what would've been a flood
of narcotics worth millions

547
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,766
on the national drug market.

548
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,226
The illicit narcotics were
smuggled into the country

549
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,437
from Red China by
way of Hong Kong.

550
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,873
The thing
got bigger and bigger

551
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,315
just when the feds turned drugs

552
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,150
into public enemy number one.

553
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,447
And I stayed as far away
from him as I could.

554
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,367
To the queen of Queens.

555
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,369
I gave Vito Downtown,

556
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,204
from Greenwich Village
to Wall Street.

557
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,789
It had been running
nice and smooth

558
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,415
for years until he took over.

559
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,128
And then all of a sudden,
I start hearing about wars,

560
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,381
feuds, bodies turning
up in the street.

561
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,593
I didn't wanna be in town.

562
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,677
I spent more time

563
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,012
up in Sands Point.

564
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,933
Oh, what a surprise.
Money in the pocket.

565
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,310
I have a feeling I'm gonna
find more in the other pocket.

566
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,395
Oh, yes.

567
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,898
Honey, honey. One of these
days I'm gonna forget,

568
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,275
and the dry cleaner's
gonna be a rich man.

569
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,319
Hey, I know you. You
won't forget nothing.

570
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,988
I don't understand why you
have to use both pockets.

571
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,908
Because... The big roll...

572
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:21,992
it ruins the crease.

573
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,161
I use two rolls.
They're smaller.

574
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,247
One's for personal.
One's for business.

575
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,290
You know,

576
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,669
lending money is a great
way to lose your money.

577
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,462
And your friends.

578
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,631
Yeah, well, I got a trick.

579
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,550
Oh, yeah, sure. Just you.

580
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,718
- Another one of your tricks.
- Yeah.

581
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,887
- What I do is I...
- Mm-hmm.

582
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,056
When somebody new wants
to borrow money from me,

583
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:48,018
I drop another 100 in there.
Another 150, even two.

584
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,812
If they don't tell
me about it...

585
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,524
then I can't trust 'em. I
don't... What good are they?

586
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,734
My God.

587
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,486
- Right?
- You're brilliant.

588
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,697
You should run a bank.

589
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,073
Yeah. I do run a bank.

590
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,169
What happened
to Bobbie and Frank?

591
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,629
They had something to do.
Well, he had something to do.

592
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,715
So, they couldn't
make it, you know.

593
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,341
But now you got me
all to yourself.

594
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,260
- Well, that's good then.
- Right.

595
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,847
Well, maybe we can
do it another time.

596
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,848
Sure. Sure, yeah.

597
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,559
Though Frank told me he
had some business thing

598
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,810
he had to do and...

599
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,146
Bobbie, yeah, well...

600
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,441
Something, I don't
know, so... It's okay.

601
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,859
Do you like his wife?

602
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,820
His wife... Bobbie's nice. You
know, she's a very nice lady.

603
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:43,199
She's a little... different
type of person that...

604
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,783
She ain't like you.

605
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,994
- What does that mean?
- No, she's like...

606
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,206
She's a... She's
Jewish, she's...

607
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,501
Look, it's easy for me
to say what I think...

608
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,711
is going on between them,

609
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,589
but I... I know why...

610
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:02,218
I have a feeling why he
canceled. I know why.

611
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,677
You look disappointed.

612
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,055
I was a little disappointed

613
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:11,519
because Frank and I are old,
old friends and... So...

614
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,521
How long are you guys friends?

615
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,731
Long time. Long,
long, long time.

616
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,941
- Childhood?
- Huh?

617
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,609
- Since we were kids, yeah.
- Child...

618
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,237
Done a lot of crazy
things together.

619
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,905
You were probably
like a little monster

620
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:23,822
when you were a kid.

621
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,282
Well, you know...

622
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,784
- I was a...
- Tyrant.

623
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,787
Frank is a more reasonable
guy in a certain way.

624
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,623
He likes to be a little more
cautious in what he does,

625
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,792
and, to his benefit,
that's a good thing.

626
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,127
You know, he'll try and work
something out with people.

627
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,838
Me, I'm looking at it
like, "Do this or that."

628
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,465
- And that's it for me.
- Right.

629
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,551
I'm done. We're gone. We're
moving forward. Period.

630
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,094
But you're more...

631
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,846
"fly off the handle"?

632
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,557
Uh, can be, can be.

633
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,267
No filter when you speak?

634
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,811
He's... He changed ever
since he was with her.

635
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:58,399
But that happens, you know,
with people, and he's...

636
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,818
He don't come down
as much down here,

637
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,486
Downtown, so much, so...

638
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,406
sometimes forgets where
he comes from and what...

639
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,951
So, she keeps him
on that other side,

640
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,786
- which is, you know, not...
- Right.

641
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,205
You know what? I'm
glad he didn't come.

642
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,916
- Let's order a drink...
- Sure.

643
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,627
- ...and something to eat.
- I would love a martini.

644
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,265
Maybe she'll calm him down.

645
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,268
What are you talking
about? They're the same.

646
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,020
He's marrying himself.

647
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,786
Tonight's
guest is the head

648
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,389
of the new Federal
Bureau of Narcotics,

649
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,123
Commissioner Harry Anslinger.

650
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,625
It's a pleasure to be here, Vic.

651
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,543
Let me start by saying

652
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,837
that this country is
asleep at the switch

653
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,756
when it comes to the
growing drug menace

654
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,090
coming in from Europe.

655
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,969
The recent arrest of New York
drug kingpin Big John Ormento

656
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:12,931
by Commissioner Anslinger and
his drug enforcement agents

657
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,767
is just the beginning
of the fight

658
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,686
against an ever-increasing
drug menace.

659
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,564
Commissioner
Anslinger is...

660
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,232
- Tony.
- ...one of the very few...

661
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,317
- Here.
- Right.

662
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,402
...to take this
problem seriously.

663
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,780
We have to clean up our
city. We have to clean up...

664
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,281
Who's listening to this garbage?

665
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,283
Turn this fucking stuff
off. Turn that off.

666
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,160
- I got it.
- Yeah, change the station.

667
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,079
These hool...

668
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,791
There are always
guys looking to get ahead

669
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,210
by doing what they
think the boss wants.

670
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:46,006
And then they find
out they're wrong.

671
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:56,619
- Hey. How are ya?
- How are you doing?

672
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,727
Mr. Riesel, can I
have your autograph?

673
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,479
No, no, no. I can't, I can't.

674
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,405
Mr. Riesel, are you okay?

675
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,572
Victor, what happened?

676
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,826
And they always,
of course, bring heat.

677
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,828
Today, Victor
Riesel was released

678
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,038
from a New York hospital.

679
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:21,041
Doctors said that the sulfuric
acid had permanently blinded

680
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:24,211
the nationally respected
crime-fighting columnist.

681
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,296
Authorities are still
hunting for the suspect

682
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,340
who threw the acid
in Riesel's face.

683
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,024
Vito didn't
like no actions taken

684
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,090
without his authorization.

685
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:33,429
Otherwise, there
could be a problem.

686
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,223
Vito was born, really,

687
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,101
in a small town on the
side of Mount Vesuvius.

688
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,644
So what else could I tell you?

689
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:42,896
How do you warn somebody

690
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,773
who grew up on the
side of a volcano?

691
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,651
They're immune to warnings.

692
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,238
- What?
- He's here.

693
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,407
He's got the whole
neighborhood, he comes here.

694
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,951
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look. Don't.

695
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,495
Don't. Don't, don't. Don't
make it obvious, come on.

696
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,706
- He lives here, Vito.
- I know. I see him.

697
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,082
I know. I see
him all the time.

698
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,876
I see him a little too much.

699
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,003
But what don't look right?

700
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,880
The guy has always
come here to eat.

701
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,173
He's not doing...

702
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,216
He's not doing
anything purposely.

703
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,134
What does he think?

704
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,636
He can just walk around and
act like nothing happened?

705
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,472
You got divorced. That's...

706
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,075
That's it. You're
not together anymore.

707
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,225
He saw we were here.

708
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,728
He walked in. He should've
turned around and walked out.

709
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,980
If we'd walked in,
he's already here,

710
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,231
that's something else.

711
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,691
But we were here first.

712
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,443
That don't look right.

713
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,196
- Come on. It's nothing.
- Hold on. Here he comes.

714
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,408
Hey.

715
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,534
- See you.
- Yeah.

716
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,540
- You want me to talk to him?
- Nah. No. Don't talk to him.

717
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,083
No, don't talk to him.

718
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,727
- Why not? I'll go.
- Don't talk to him.

719
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,420
- No, no, no.
- Vito.

720
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,089
I think you should let
it go. Just let it go.

721
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,257
I did let it go.

722
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,218
Forgot about it already.

723
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,721
Well, you don't
gotta worry about me.

724
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,223
What you talking about?

725
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,809
Gone. It's gone already.

726
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:05,978
Poof.

727
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,659
I'd look good in a
mink coat, honey.

728
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:19,743
Mm-hmm.

729
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,329
You'd look good in
a shower curtain.

730
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,338
Hey, Silvio.

731
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,924
- How are you?
- Hey.

732
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,176
I wanna talk with you for
a minute. Come downstairs.

733
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,980
We'll go to Marcuccio.
I'll buy you a drink.

734
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,307
We have somebody in common now.

735
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,268
- Wanna ask you some questions.
- Sure.

736
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,525
You cocksucking...

737
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,361
You wanna make me do that, you
fucking... Oh, no, no, huh?

738
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,321
You don't know to walk
out, you motherfucker?

739
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,699
You don't know to walk out?

740
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,041
...go around my wife.
You think you can do it

741
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,626
in front of me and
everybody else?

742
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,691
...walk around the fucking
neighborhood like that?

743
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,550
You make me look like
a fucking scumbag?

744
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,594
She's with me now, you
understand? With me.

745
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,477
Do you wanna walk along
the fucking neighborhood

746
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,435
and make me look like some
fucking piece of shit?

747
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:31,106
She's married to me! To me!
To me, to me, to me, to me!

748
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:36,236
The second guy was
some poor bastard

749
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,572
who went up there
for fresh air and...

750
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,491
well, was unlucky.

751
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,244
Everybody knew what happened.

752
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,371
The priests knew. Cops knew.

753
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,540
The whole neighborhood
knew. Everybody knew.

754
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,751
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna say?

755
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,934
Between Anna and the feds,

756
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,186
nothing got better.

757
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,068
In the years after Vito
got rid of Anna's husband,

758
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,361
nothing was the same.

759
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,371
I'm standing out here like a
crazy woman with Frankie Boy.

760
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,831
You are such a
disappointment to me.

761
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,625
I thought you were my friend.

762
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,461
Fucking alienated in
the business. You...

763
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,672
This should never
happen to anybody.

764
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,965
Yeah... I know that you know.

765
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,133
And you and Frank are probably

766
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,427
having a good laugh
on my expense.

767
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,685
She can't call ten times a day.

768
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,603
Tomorrow, I'll
talk. But not now.

769
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,609
I know what to do.

770
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,745
To make matters worse,
Frankie Boy let Anna know

771
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,039
that Vito was skimming
money off the top.

772
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,582
That was a decision

773
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,002
that Frankie Boy
would come to regret.

774
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,398
You son of a bitch, Vito.

775
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,067
I knew you'd be here
taking my money.

776
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,819
Is this what you've
been doing, Vito?

777
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,697
I'm not taking everything.
I'm taking what comes to me.

778
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,240
For your what? Your
fucking whores?

779
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,159
Look at me when I talk to you.

780
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,469
Why don't you try respecting me?

781
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,327
Please, relax.

782
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,829
- Calm down.
- How's that?

783
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,181
- Calm down.
- You're making a scene.

784
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,499
You mind your business
too. How's that?

785
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,269
- Mind your business.
- Okay. Anna, look at me.

786
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,544
You think I'm afraid of you?

787
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,589
- My fucking money.
- What the fuck are you doing?

788
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,674
- That's my fucking money.
- Come on. Hey. Hey.

789
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:03,925
Give me my money.

790
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,679
You son of a bitch. I'm
taking you to court.

791
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,723
- Anna. Hey, take it easy.
- I'm not lying!

792
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,200
The hell are
we gonna do about her?

793
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,059
This woman's crazy.

794
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:15,103
- You have nothing! It's mine!
- Anna, relax. Relax.

795
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,063
All right.

796
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,148
- Just breathe, Anna.
- He's a greedy fuck.

797
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,274
What's he doing?

798
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,734
Looks like he's
calming her down.

799
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,736
Calming her down?
"Calming her down"?

800
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,988
That don't look like
"calming her down" to me.

801
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,239
What do you think he's doing?

802
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,217
- He's calming her down.
- I don't know. I'm asking you.

803
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,577
Calming her down? That's
"calming her down"?

804
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,246
The guy's trying to help
us out here with her.

805
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,791
- It doesn't look to me...
- She's off her rocker.

806
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,918
I know that she's crazy,
but look at the...

807
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,586
Look how he's...

808
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,412
I think you're making
a big thing out of nothing.

809
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,464
I don't...

810
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,359
The guy is just trying to
help us out, that's all.

811
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,344
That ain't the way you
calm somebody down.

812
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,596
Just because
we're separated...

813
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,514
Anna.

814
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,516
...he wants to kick
me out of my own club.

815
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,850
Do you hear me?

816
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:57,354
This son of a bitch
motherfucker that he is.

817
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,606
He's fucking with
the wrong person.

818
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,775
I caught him in my fucking club

819
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:06,029
with his greedy, fat
fucking sausage fingers

820
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:08,406
in my register, taking my money.

821
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,700
- Anna? Anna...
- Let me tell you something.

822
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,077
Anna, I... I gotta go.

823
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm gonna get more
than what he stole...

824
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,626
- That was Anna again.
- Yeah.

825
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,462
She is losing her mind, and
she is driving me crazy.

826
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,673
You have got to call Vito.

827
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,008
- You've got to talk to Vito.
- I can't talk to him.

828
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,385
You have to talk to him.

829
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,387
She just said that
she's threatening

830
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,721
to take him to court,

831
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,056
and she will do it.

832
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,740
I'm telling you, we
gotta stay out of it.

833
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,809
Let them work it out.

834
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,145
I'm sorry. I know.
It's too much.

835
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,896
It'll make it worse
if I call him.

836
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,439
Uh, don't bet on it.

837
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,775
Honey, I'm telling you
it would make it worse.

838
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,695
Just let it go for
now. Let it go.

839
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,423
Had I known
what was coming down the pipe

840
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,282
with Vito and Anna,

841
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,201
I would've spoken up more.
I would've said something.

842
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,162
But with Vito, he's
just too bullheaded.

843
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,288
You can't change his mind.

844
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,455
Vito, you'll be there.

845
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,724
What's my
wife got to do...

846
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,017
What are you talking
to her now for?

847
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,102
Are you a marriage counselor?

848
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,670
Vito, she calls
Bobbie ten times a day.

849
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,606
What are we supposed to
do? Not answer the phone?

850
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,816
Not do nothing?
What can we do?

851
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,008
That, I'm sorry about.

852
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,968
But listen, she's...
she's okay. She's excited.

853
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,171
Well, I mean, she's nervous.

854
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,059
What are you gonna do?
It's nothing. It's fine.

855
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:17,559
This man took
over my business,

856
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,728
and he is trying to destroy me.

857
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,106
He says he's broke. He's not.

858
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,151
He is a millionaire
many times over.

859
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,986
He gets thousands.

860
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,114
Thousands in tax-free
money every week.

861
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:34,784
I had 24-carat gold
and platinum dishes.

862
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,079
My silverware was the
best that money can buy.

863
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:41,875
Every weekend we
would have parties.

864
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,920
Twenty-five to 30
people would show up.

865
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,839
We would hire entertainers
from New York.

866
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:53,720
I had 30 gowns upstairs
in my walk-in closet.

867
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,181
So, no matter what he says,

868
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,851
believe me, Your Honor,
he's got the money.

869
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:03,939
He's got after-hour clubs
in Greenwich Village.

870
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,441
He's got dog tracks in Virginia.

871
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,943
Who has a dog track?

872
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:12,447
He gets paper bags filled
with money delivered to him.

873
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,448
Every week.

874
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,701
And believe me, Your
Honor, I know. I saw it.

875
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,578
And let me tell you something,

876
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,081
as crazy as this sounds,

877
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,707
I still love him.

878
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,794
I know.
I sound crazy.

879
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,005
But if he wanted me
back, I'd go back today.

880
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,049
That's the truth.

881
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,345
I even reached out to his
good friend Frank Costello,

882
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,932
who is a very important
man in this city.

883
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,851
And he has a lot of
influence with my husband.

884
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:42,936
What happened?

885
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,313
Frank spoke to him,

886
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:48,024
and-and even that didn't work.

887
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,403
So, you know, I
don't what to say.

888
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,046
He didn't even listen
to Frank Costello,

889
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:55,490
and they know each other
since they're kids.

890
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,576
He didn't even listen to Frank.

891
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,455
How is this possible?

892
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,500
I can't believe she
mentioned your name in court.

893
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,919
If he just gave her the money,

894
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,088
they wouldn't even
be in court. I...

895
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,811
If I gave 'em the
money, it would be good.

896
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,026
- But I couldn't, God forbid.
- It's not about the money.

897
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,885
He treated her like
a piece of garbage.

898
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,679
That's what this is about.

899
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,723
She's a moron. He's a maniac.

900
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,183
And now you're on the
cover of the paper.

901
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,686
Just gotta weather the storm.

902
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,957
Judge, I have to
admit, this woman is a puzzle.

903
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:28,981
Big puzzle.

904
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,775
She lived with me as my wife,

905
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,819
and then she puts a knife
into me, Your Honor.

906
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,905
She testifies all around
that I'm a gangster.

907
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,991
That's when all my
troubles started.

908
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,160
I-I'm a homebody.
A devoted husband.

909
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,411
She says it herself.

910
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,289
I was shocked at my
wife's foul language.

911
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,166
In my opinion,
she's a sick woman

912
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,601
who's going through
a change of life

913
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,460
when she flew the coop.

914
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,211
I don't think she knew
what she was doing

915
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:51,212
or saying, Your Honor.

916
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,714
Were you unfaithful?

917
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,967
Honestly, Judge, look
at me. You see a Romeo?

918
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,345
Huh?

919
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,781
You've
been described as,

920
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,223
"The King of the Rackets."

921
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,076
- That's ridiculous.
- That you're a millionaire.

922
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,934
I wish.

923
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:07,354
Nice thought, Your
Honor, but wrong again.

924
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,646
My only income's as manager of

925
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,857
the Colonial Trading Company
on Washington Street.

926
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,568
We pick up scrap paper
from Manhattan offices.

927
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,403
I have my taxes.
I can prove it.

928
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,614
Every single word

929
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,575
that is coming out of
this man's mouth right now

930
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,868
is a complete lie.

931
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,846
Why don't you do us a
favor? Keep your mouth shut.

932
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:24,913
It'd be better.

933
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,058
- She's not in her right mind.
- I think you're crazy.

934
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,018
- Nah. Yeah, well, I'm crazy.
- You're crazy.

935
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,043
You're the actor.

936
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:33,296
You're acting right now for
this whole goddamn court.

937
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,940
- And they all know it.
- Ma'am.

938
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,176
- The best actor in the world.
- Please control yourself.

939
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,845
Better than Clark Gable.
He's sitting right here.

940
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,680
And I am brokenhearted

941
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,392
that I even gotta be here
begging for my money.

942
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,894
This is my hard-earned
money. Okay?

943
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:51,689
And he tried to take over
my whole entire business.

944
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,108
Can you collect yourself please?

945
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,025
That's what he does.

946
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:55,402
He gets his hands on everything.

947
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,630
- Right? That's what you do?
- Take a moment...

948
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,948
- Get your hands on everything.
- ...to collect yourself.

949
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,908
And then it becomes yours.

950
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,344
I don't know what
to say, Your Honor.

951
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,762
She's not in her
right mind, this lady.

952
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,830
He gives all his
money to the puttanes.

953
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,915
That's where they go, to
the dirty little whores.

954
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,583
That's where they
go. That's why...

955
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:11,835
Maybe you are broke.

956
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,711
- Ma'am.
- Maybe you are broke, Vito.

957
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,475
Because maybe you gave...

958
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:16,690
...all your money
to the whores.

959
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,007
Mrs. Genovese. Ma'am.

960
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,931
- Collect yourself.
- I don't know what to say.

961
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:22,470
This is now a circus
right now, with you.

962
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,264
You're a clown. Yeah?

963
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,015
You're not a gangster,
you're a clown.

964
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,143
You're a disappointment.

965
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,395
Vito invited
the local press...

966
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,188
Yeah, this is unbelievable.

967
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:33,857
He invited the local press

968
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,234
to a little house he bought
in Freehold, New Jersey,

969
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,987
to show the court he was
a regular working stiff.

970
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,822
Relax. Yeah, what'd
you guys expect?

971
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,574
A bunch of guys
with machine guns

972
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,491
all over the place?

973
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,094
You watch too many movies.

974
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,411
You listen to the cops too much.

975
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,204
I hope you guys are hungry.

976
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,999
I gotta make sure youse
all leave here very happy.

977
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,584
If you're not happy,
I'm not happy,

978
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,987
and then I'm gonna
get in trouble.

979
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,753
So you gotta write
nice things about me.

980
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,214
Your wife testified that you
were head of the lottery.

981
00:45:58,298 --> 00:45:59,650
- The numbers racket?
- Yeah.

982
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,026
According to her
and everybody else,

983
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,403
I must be a man
with, like, 12 heads.

984
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,554
Besides the lottery, they
say I'm the head of this,

985
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,806
I'm the head of that...
I'm the head of everything.

986
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,933
But you know what? You
write what you want.

987
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,603
Couple of sausages for you.

988
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,980
After we eat, do
whatever youse want.

989
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,791
Give me the third degree.
Whatever youse want.

990
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:16,900
Hang on. Look at my closet.

991
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,444
I got five suits,
five pairs of shoes.

992
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,322
I haven't bought a new suit
in, I don't know, five years.

993
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:23,781
Yeah. Sorry, it's
a little dusty.

994
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:24,699
What'd you think?

995
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,510
I put it there yesterday
just to fool youse? Huh?

996
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,747
Come on. Look at my mansion
with the plasterboard walls.

997
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,624
Look at where I sleep.
That's where I sleep.

998
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,643
You think I'd be worried if
I'm so close to the window.

999
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,502
If there's a problem.

1000
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,129
Worried about somebody come
and shoot me, huh? Nah.

1001
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,380
I got nothing to worry about.

1002
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,508
The bed's here, the
window's there. So what?

1003
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:42,759
If I had something to hide,

1004
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,322
I wouldn't have let
youse in the door.

1005
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,887
Give me some credit. Come on.

1006
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,448
We'll go in the other
rooms. Have a drink.

1007
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,265
Vito got some
positive attention

1008
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:50,183
in the newspapers

1009
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,852
until the judge ruled
in Anna's favor.

1010
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:55,730
She received the alimony and
control of the Zebra Club.

1011
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,857
My Lord, that got
him fucking crazy.

1012
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:58,983
He went nuts.

Within a few months,

1026
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,424
the repercussions of Anna
mentioning my association

1027
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,468
with Vito in court proved
to be a disaster for me.

1028
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,304
The headline identifies him

1029
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,931
as quote, "Gambler
Frank Costello."

1030
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,309
And even quotes him asking,

1031
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,769
"What do they think
I am? Superman?"

1032
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,981
Well, we don't
think he's Superman.

1033
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,108
And in the light of
mob violence today

1034
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,318
and the growing drug menace,

1035
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,111
these hearings are to determine

1036
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,363
how a man like Frank Costello,

1037
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:30,158
a professional gambler
who has been convicted

1038
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,744
of offenses ranging from assault

1039
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,079
to carrying a loaded gun,

1040
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,206
could still have enough
political connections

1041
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:41,336
to nominate mayors,
judges and city officials,

1042
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,756
leaving our cities vulnerable
to municipal corruption.

1043
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,467
His name is even mentioned
as close confidant

1044
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,845
of mobster Vito Genovese
in a family court case.

1045
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,056
I think you
look good, Frank.

1046
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,474
Looks, uh... You look regal.

1047
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,352
Anyways, this is all, uh,
just political posturing.

1048
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,978
Kefauver's running
for president.

1049
00:48:59,062 --> 00:48:59,896
He needs publicity.

1050
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,373
He wants to get it
on your coattails.

1051
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,565
That's a close picture.

1052
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,776
I was worried you were
gonna look heavy. Kinda fat.

1053
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:05,693
But you look good.

1054
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,111
- No double chin.
- Oh, well, I...

1055
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,238
Huh? No doub...
Well, you know...

1056
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:10,365
I don't want your...

1057
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,176
- Thanks for the compliment.
- Listen, you look regal.

1058
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,618
- Huh?
- You look like royalty.

1059
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,079
Yeah. Royalty.

1060
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,390
So what does that
mean? What do you mean?

1061
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,792
- What do you think?
- Easy. We go to court.

1062
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,002
You plead the Fifth.
We go to lunch.

1063
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:25,296
So just the Fifth. That's
what you're saying?

1064
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,549
I've got a problem with that.
We should talk about it.

1065
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:32,512
I'll pay, Frank. All
right? I'll buy you lunch.

1066
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,764
That's... That's a
very tempting offer

1067
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,350
in your new fancy office
that I helped to pay for.

1068
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,268
But now we gotta keep
paying the rent, Frank,

1069
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:40,603
so I need you to stay in check.

1070
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,605
Yeah, yeah, I know. I
wanna keep you there.

1071
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:43,898
I wanna keep you there, as...

1072
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,608
As long as you keep
me out of trouble,

1073
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,901
I can keep you there.

1074
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,379
...of our program.

1075
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,838
The appearance of our
mystery celebrity.

1076
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:50,964
And since our experts over here

1077
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,366
would recognize our
famous guest on sight,

1078
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,076
we've provided them
with blindfolds.

1079
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,759
Are all those blindfolds
in place, panel?

1080
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,995
- Aye aye.
- Yeah!

1081
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,640
Will you come
in, mystery challenger,

1082
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,207
and sign in, please?

1083
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,509
Now, you come over
here and sit down next to me.

1084
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,427
Panel, as you know,

1085
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,946
in the case of our
mystery celebrity,

1086
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,555
we dispense with
the usual amenities

1087
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,682
and get right down to
the general questioning.

1088
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,630
Uh, let's begin the general
questioning with Miss Francis.

1089
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,229
Are you in the
entertainment business?

1090
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:28,860
No.

1091
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,486
No. That's one down

1092
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,155
- and nine to go.
- What? No?

1093
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:36,909
Is that okay? That a senator
goes on a... on a game show?

1094
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:40,163
Uh, I wanna see him talk
about his political pals

1095
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,165
on the payroll
back in Tennessee.

1096
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,334
Or the deputy sheriffs
who work as valet parkers

1097
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,044
at the casinos on
their days off.

1098
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:48,254
Let him talk about that.

1099
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:49,714
You know so much.

1100
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,108
You should have
your own hearings.

1101
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,175
Yeah.

1102
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,218
If I did, I wouldn't
be on What's My Line?

1103
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,765
Are you in, uh,
federal politics?

1104
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,099
Yes.

1105
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,435
Are you at
present mixed up

1106
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,979
in a very famous investigation?

1107
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,063
Yes.

1108
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,316
Uh, are you
on the right side

1109
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,484
of this investigation?

1110
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,779
- I hope so.
- Oh, that voice.

1111
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,447
Are you
Senator Kefauver?

1112
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,741
Yes. That's right.

1113
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:24,999
I respectfully
decline to answer...

1114
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,793
...your questions, on
the grounds that...

1115
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,629
...my answer may tend
to incriminate me.

1116
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,506
I respectfully decline to answer

1117
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,966
on the grounds that my answer
may tend to incriminate...

1118
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,277
...might tend to
incriminate me.

1119
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,386
...my answer may tend
to incriminate me.

1120
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,930
I respectfully decline to answer

1121
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,433
on the grounds that my answer
may tend to incriminate me.

1122
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:45,770
Chief Counsel Halley will
continue the questioning.

1123
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,396
Mr. Profaci, are
you the president

1124
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,940
of the Bella Mia
Olive Oil company

1125
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,901
on 79th Street in Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn, New York City?

1126
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:53,861
I refuse to answer

1127
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:58,157
on the grounds that my answers
might tend to incriminate me.

1128
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,868
Mr. Profaci, I'm asking
about your job title.

1129
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,203
I refuse to answer

1130
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,956
on the grounds that my answers
might tend to incriminate me.

1131
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,958
You're listed as such
in the telephone book.

1132
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,377
I refuse to answer on
the grounds that...

1133
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,838
The phone book. At least
you can answer that.

1134
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,423
I refuse to answer

1135
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:17,552
on the grounds that my answers
might tend to incriminate me.

1136
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,097
Okay, Mr. Profaci, let's
just... keep it simple. Okay?

1137
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,350
How old are you?

1138
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,020
I respectfully refuse to
answer on the grounds...

1139
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,498
How can you
refuse to answer?

1140
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:31,357
I'm asking about
your date of birth.

1141
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,694
One thing can lead to another.

1142
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,154
- Can you believe this?
- I can't.

1143
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,031
I can't do that.
I can't do it.

1144
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,742
Well, you got to.
Everybody's taking the Fifth.

1145
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,036
Well, if I take
the Fifth, then...

1146
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,621
who's gonna call
me back? Nobody.

1147
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:47,290
There's certain
people I know that...

1148
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,917
They're gonna be too afraid.
They won't take the chance.

1149
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,001
Once I take the Fifth,

1150
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,129
certain people are not
gonna wanna call me anymore.

1151
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,172
They don't wanna be associated.

1152
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,800
'Cause everybody knows only
guilty people take the Fifth.

1153
00:52:57,884 --> 00:52:58,718
You know that.

1154
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,970
What do you want me to
tell the committee, Frank?

1155
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,763
Tell 'em to save their
subpoena, George.

1156
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,181
I'll testify voluntarily.

1157
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,018
No. As your lawyer, I have to
advise against you testifying.

1158
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,519
I'll admit I'm an ex-bootlegger.

1159
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:11,230
I'll admit I did 11
months on a gun charge.

1160
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,065
A misdemeanor. It was
over 30 years ago.

1161
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:14,859
I mean, today I'm a
professional gambler.

1162
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,445
I'm in real estate.
I give to charities.

1163
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,672
- I pay my taxes.
- Yeah. I know.

1164
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,406
What are they gonna
ask? That's all I know.

1165
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,592
This isn't Tammany Hall, Frank.

1166
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:22,450
This is a panel

1167
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,619
of United States senators
up there. All right?

1168
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,496
And they didn't all go on
What's My Line? last week.

1169
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,260
They're all a bunch of
politicians, George.

1170
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:31,042
Stuff a couple of
dollars in their pocket,

1171
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,293
they go away, you know?

1172
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,211
It's just how much.

1173
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:37,214
Two dollars, ten dollars, 50
dollars, thousand dollars.

1174
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,133
It's the same
thing. They want...

1175
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,551
You can pay them
off in a second.

1176
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:41,636
All right.

1177
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,137
I'll just tell 'em
I know nothing.

1178
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,223
Ladies
and gentlemen,

1179
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,017
while this is the nation's

1180
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,519
first televised
congressional hearing,

1181
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:53,105
Mr. Costello has
agreed to appear

1182
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,107
and testify voluntarily.

1183
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:57,360
Therefore, to
secure his privacy,

1184
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,904
the live television broadcast
cameras will refrain

1185
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,073
from photographing
Mr. Costello's face

1186
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:03,991
during his testimony.

1187
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:06,035
Mr. Halley.

1188
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,620
- Is it?
- It's live.

1189
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,082
Have you ever been
known by any name

1190
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,708
other than "Frank Costello"?

1191
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,752
Like, "Francesco Castiglia"?

1192
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,129
Castiglia was a family name.

1193
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,382
My mother's name was Saverio.

1194
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:21,234
Fucking uses his hands.

1195
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,153
They're showing the kind
of cigarettes he smokes.

1196
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,577
What's this, a
cigarette commercial?

1197
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,764
You know, a lot of
foreign-born people,

1198
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,517
when they came to America,
they used the family name.

1199
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,727
When I was growing up,
I might've used it.

1200
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:33,538
You're not using
the English language

1201
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:34,957
when you say, "Might
have used them."

1202
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,316
"Might have" means
nothing grammatically.

1203
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,276
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Halley.

1204
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,600
I'm not a college man like you.

1205
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,032
You were
a bootlegger.

1206
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,784
- Correct?
- Yes, I was.

1207
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,786
Just about every
person in this country

1208
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,246
who took a drink
during those times

1209
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,872
was in business with me.

1210
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,166
Take the fucking
Fifth, you fucking...

1211
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,334
F-Frank.

1212
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:56,794
What's the fucking
matter with him?

1213
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,505
I believe you're acquainted
with a man named John Ormento.

1214
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,674
I am acquainted with him, yes.

1215
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:02,758
Are you aware

1216
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,277
that John Ormento was
recently convicted

1217
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,595
of a narcotics conspiracy
and is facing life in prison?

1218
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,139
I haven't paid that
much attention.

1219
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,992
Talking about things he
shouldn't be talking about.

1220
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,776
Have you paid attention
to the growing danger

1221
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,011
of narcotics in this country?

1222
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,898
Where are you go... What,
are you fucking stunad?

1223
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,189
What's the matter with you?

1224
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,191
Fucking crazy.

1225
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,819
- He getting me all excited.
- I know.

1226
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,530
Take the
Fifth. Take the Fifth!

1227
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,882
I've paid
enough attention to know

1228
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,284
that it's a low and filthy
business that trades in misery

1229
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,952
and that we should
rid ourselves of it.

1230
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,413
Coming out against drugs is
very noble, Mr. Costello.

1231
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,415
Upstanding citizen.
Mr. Legitimate.

1232
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,624
Get the fuck outta here.

1233
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,108
But how
do we rid ourselves

1234
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,294
of that other social vice?

1235
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,129
The one in which
you are involved?

1236
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,464
Illegal gambling.

1237
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,217
Well, to do
that, Mr. Halley,

1238
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,137
you'd have to burn
all the tracks

1239
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,055
and shoot all the horses.

1240
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,560
You may think this is
funny, Mr. Costello,

1241
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:55,936
but the two great enemies

1242
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,190
within our ranks today are
criminals and Communists.

1243
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,484
Oh, another thieving bastard.

1244
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,652
Another fucking...
They're the same thing.

1245
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,696
The same bunch of
fucking crooks.

1246
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,032
- Let me ask you, Mr. Costello.
- All thieves.

1247
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,035
Why did you even want to
be an American citizen?

1248
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:12,995
Why?

1249
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,956
Well, 'cause I
love this country.

1250
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,750
Why'd you wanna become
an American citizen?

1251
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,418
Yeah. Yeah.

1252
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:22,088
But you were born here
15 generations ago.

1253
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:24,924
Didn't their grandfathers,
their great-grandfathers,

1254
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,651
their great-great-great-great
grandfathers...

1255
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,260
They were robbing
way before we ever...

1256
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,762
They robbed everybody.

1257
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,472
Now they get all
high and mighty.

1258
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:32,932
From the time you
became a citizen,

1259
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,683
what have you done
for this country?

1260
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,521
I paid my tax.

1261
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,401
Can you remember

1262
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,197
meeting Mayor William
O'Dwyer at your apartment

1263
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,366
with some judges and the
leaders of Tammany Hall?

1264
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,078
- Uh-oh, here we go.
- Okay, O'Dwyer.

1265
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,162
O'Dwyer.

1266
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,041
Oh, Frank, I can't believe this.

1267
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,586
This would have
been during the war.

1268
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,594
I've had a lot of
people at the apartment.

1269
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,805
When Mayor
O'Dwyer was still

1270
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,128
the Brooklyn district attorney.

1271
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,725
When he was prosecuting
Albert Anastasia

1272
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:17,809
of Murder, Incorporated.

1273
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:20,020
Was he at your apartment
during that period?

1274
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,730
They got him. They got him.

1275
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,446
I'm sorry.

1276
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,699
Counselor, can I have
a glass of water?

1277
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,142
- I have a throat infection.
- Go right ahead, sir.

1278
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,580
You've got a fucking
throat infection?

1279
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,266
You've got a big fucking
mouth. And you're stuck.

1280
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,210
You don't know what the
fuck to do with yourself.

1281
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,044
We simply want
to know, Mr. Costello,

1282
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,797
how many times Mayor O'Dwyer
was at your apartment

1283
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,817
while he was still the
Brooklyn district attorney.

1284
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:51,010
Was it once? Twice? Ten times?

1285
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,470
Most importantly,
why was he there?

1286
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,365
He can't get out
of this. He can't get out.

1287
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,932
Shut up, you stool
pigeon bastard.

1288
00:57:57,016 --> 00:57:58,017
He can't get out of that.

1289
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,820
Were the
meetings at your apartment

1290
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,979
to get O'Dwyer Tammany's
support for mayor

1291
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,647
and to get him to
stop his prosecution

1292
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,649
of Albert Anastasia and
Murder, Incorporated?

1293
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:06,859
Yes or no?

1294
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,207
You don't know what the
fuck to do with yourself.

1295
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,000
What the fuck are
you doing? The Fifth!

1296
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,084
He's in the crapper now.

1297
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,437
What are you gonna
do? He's right.

1298
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:26,295
They got him.

1299
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,672
You opened up the door, and
they're fucking storming in.

1300
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,549
These fucking
Protestant bastards.

1301
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,384
Yeah, you
don't have to answer.

1302
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:36,972
Uh, Mr. Chairman, since my
client volunteered to testify,

1303
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,641
uh, could he return tomorrow

1304
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,309
to better answer all
of your questions?

1305
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:41,894
No.

1306
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:44,271
Mr. Chairman, in
order to get at the truth,

1307
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,357
we need this witness to
answer these questions now

1308
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,983
while he is still under oath

1309
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:49,360
and unable to refresh his memory

1310
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,028
with other potential witnesses.

1311
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,447
The witness will continue.

1312
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,634
How many times did you meet
O'Dwyer at your apartment?

1313
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,493
Mr. Chairman, I
testified voluntarily.

1314
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,995
I would appreciate it if
I could come back tomorrow

1315
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,080
when I'm feeling better.

1316
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,249
You don't get to choose.

1317
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,125
You don't get to
choose. He's right.

1318
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,252
Who volunteers?

1319
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:08,379
Cheech has lost
his fucking mind!

1320
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:09,880
No, you shouldn't
be fucking there.

1321
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:11,632
You should be taking the Fifth.

1322
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,384
Take the fucking Fifth!

1323
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,844
What's the matter
with you? Frank, jeez.

1324
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:18,931
Frank, what is the
fucking matter with you?

1325
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,433
Am I a defendant?

1326
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,060
No.

1327
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,104
Is this a court of law?

1328
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:26,689
No.

1329
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,190
Am I under arrest?

1330
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,274
You are not.

1331
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,902
Well, then, I'm walking out.

1332
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,696
Walk. Good.

1333
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,281
Now finally he walks.

1334
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,034
Do not walk out on a
congressional hearing.

1335
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:43,289
That is contempt of Congress.
You are risking arrest.

1336
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:47,435
- Hey, Frank!
- Mr. Costello!

1337
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,421
I tell you, there's something
to think about in America.

1338
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,131
I wanna make
sure that you...

1339
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,234
- Choke, you fuck.
- He walked.

1340
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,458
Well,
he had to walk.

1341
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:58,168
They were gonna ask him about
what'd he do with O'Dwyer.

1342
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,263
He had to walk out.

1343
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:03,017
It's the politics. What
Frank did for Albert.

1344
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,310
Of course they're after that.

1345
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:07,688
Whatever he did should
stay in this fucking room,

1346
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,148
not on television.

1347
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:12,151
You know, O'Dwyer was sending
everybody to the chair.

1348
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,068
- Yeah.
- Remember?

1349
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:14,862
And Albert was next.

1350
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,656
But before the trial
was gonna begin,

1351
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,118
O'Dwyer, he quits the
DA to run for mayor.

1352
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,244
Out of nowhere, right?

1353
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:23,688
- Joey, right?
- Come on.

1354
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:24,788
Who's kidding who?

1355
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:26,332
O'Dwyer's an ex-cop.

1356
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,167
He's got no money,
no connections.

1357
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,084
He's got nothing.

1358
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,961
Now all of a sudden
he's running for mayor

1359
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,255
with Tammany Hall
backing him up. Come on.

1360
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:35,215
And that was
Frank who set him up.

1361
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,801
Vito, they're looking to find
out his political connection.

1362
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,487
They want to know if
this is what they want.

1363
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,281
- This is what they're after.
- I see that.

1364
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,640
Especially after
Reles went out the window.

1365
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,060
Because O'Dwyer had Reles
thrown out the window,

1366
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,912
next thing you know,
Frank's taking care of him.

1367
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:50,856
You remember he went out
the sixth-story window?

1368
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:53,067
While he's being
watched around the clock

1369
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,401
by O'Dwyer's own cops.

1370
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,254
Now, you can... What does
that tell youse, right?

1371
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,489
He threw Abe Reles
out the window

1372
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,784
because O'Dwyer was
helping out Frank, right?

1373
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,286
And the cops
said... the cops said,

1374
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,497
"Reles tried to escape."

1375
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,874
Who climbs out of a
sixth-story window

1376
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,317
with a five-foot
bedsheet?

1377
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:11,519
- I mean...
- That's right.

1378
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,796
Right. You... Right.
You believe that bullshit?

1379
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,631
O'Dwyer? I didn't
believe nothing

1380
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,466
until O'Dwyer got
sworn in as mayor.

1381
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,259
What does
that tell you, Vito?

1382
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,220
- He saved Albert's ass.
- Yeah.

1383
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,263
So what do you
think it tells me?

1384
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,349
Frank's got a lot of pull,
politically, you know?

1385
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,266
I'm telling you.

1386
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,435
If he could fix that
thing for Albert,

1387
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,937
what does that tell you?

1388
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,231
- All right.
- Frank's got muscle.

1389
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:33,399
What does that tell you

1390
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:34,983
about Cheech's
political connections?

1391
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:35,901
That's the point.

1392
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,320
Got a mayor
elected, for Christ's sakes.

1393
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,032
One of the
downsides of the hearings

1394
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:44,576
is that they exposed
Anastasia's connection

1395
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,911
and allegiance to me.

1396
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,997
And knowing Vito,
hmm, that's a no-no.

1397
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,082
He's not gonna like that.

1398
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,668
["Money"

1399
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:06,890
I was
heading to a sit-down

1400
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,809
with Vito at the Waldorf.

1401
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:12,146
And my frustrations with
him was at a boiling point.

1402
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,857
I mean, I did 14 months
for contempt of Congress.

1403
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,900
None of that would've
ever come about

1404
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,795
without Anna mentioning
this close relationship

1405
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,989
that me and Vito had at
the family court hearing.

1406
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,993
I was a mobster once again in
the minds of many. Too many.

1407
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:27,786
Now, all Vito had to
do was pay her off.

1408
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,038
That's all he had
to do. End of story.

1409
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,040
And Vito's downtown
brutal tactics

1410
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:34,376
were causing all kinds
of problems for us.

1411
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,129
Not to mention his continual
involvement in the drug thing,

1412
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:40,090
which I feared was about
to blow up in our faces

1413
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,550
and take us all down.

1414
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,552
I was angry. I was
frustrated with him,

1415
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:46,472
and I needed to stop him doing
these fucking crazy things.

1416
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:05,616
So, what's up?

1417
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:06,992
Well, where do I start?

1418
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,495
With the feds looking
to put you away...

1419
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:12,414
This is what I'm here
for? Why I'm here? Huh?

1420
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:13,499
To talk about this?

1421
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,310
I warned you about them.
Look what's happened.

1422
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:16,752
I was very patient
the last time.

1423
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,253
I talked to you about that.

1424
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:20,088
What'd you do? Nothing.
Where'd it get me?

1425
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:21,173
Where'd it get me?

1426
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,591
You are gonna take us all down.

1427
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:24,301
How simple do I gotta make it?

1428
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,844
I waited for you.

1429
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,263
I waited for you to get
me back where I was.

1430
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:29,699
To straighten me
out the right way.

1431
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:30,891
What'd you do? Nothing.

1432
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,267
- Nothing.
- All right.

1433
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,591
You made me look like some
kind of fucking morto di fame.

1434
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:36,271
What the fuck? Frank.

1435
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:39,024
Vito. Vito, it's just
a matter of time.

1436
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,984
You're going down a
very dangerous road,

1437
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:42,361
and you know that.

1438
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,321
And we ain't been down
dangerous roads before?

1439
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,216
All of a sudden, we can't
go down dangerous roads?

1440
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,033
This is a road that
I'm not going down,

1441
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,952
because you're gonna
take us all down.

1442
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:50,869
This is not the way.

1443
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,514
You know that it's
just a matter of time.

1444
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:53,664
You're gonna get pinched.

1445
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,141
You got away with
two murders already.

1446
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,976
They're looking to get
you. They're gonna get you.

1447
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,085
They will get you.

1448
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,462
They will get you.
You know that.

1449
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,714
You didn't wanna listen to
me. You went your own way.

1450
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,692
But you gotta know this
is gonna fucking blow up.

1451
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:07,511
Let's remember something. I
put you where you are today.

1452
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,805
It's because of
me. Because of me.

1453
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,116
And if I were you,
I would okay this

1454
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,141
because this is too big.

1455
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,560
I gotta tell you, it's too big.

1456
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:16,871
Nobody wants to get pinched,
but that's the risk you take.

1457
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,915
- Me? I take that risk.
- But you're not where I am.

1458
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:19,940
You're not where I am.

1459
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,316
And I'm not okaying this, and...

1460
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,735
You-You can't keep this
up. They're onto you.

1461
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,612
How many times do
I gotta say that?

1462
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,048
It's just
a matter of time.

1463
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,782
You got those two
murders already.

1464
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:31,052
That was the risk you took.
Look where it got you.

1465
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,160
You gave it to me.

1466
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:33,524
That was your risk
that you took.

1467
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:36,582
You went on the lam to
Italy. For a long time.

1468
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:38,292
That's why you're
not where I am.

1469
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,436
Because you're out of control.
You're a loose cannon.

1470
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,795
You're a fucking drunken cowboy.

1471
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,880
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Legitimate.

1472
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:45,841
Mr. Good Citizen.
Mr. Fundraiser.

1473
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:48,051
With all that bullshit
good citizen stuff.

1474
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:50,345
You think they ain't
gonna get you too? Huh?

1475
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:52,639
You wanna be involved in
charities and all that stuff?

1476
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:53,974
That's very nice, Cheech.

1477
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,892
But don't forget,
you're a racketeer,

1478
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,519
you're a gangster. Come on.

1479
01:04:57,603 --> 01:04:58,812
What are we talking about?

1480
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,248
You don't wanna be
involved with junk

1481
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:01,499
because of the
time you might get?

1482
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:02,983
You're worried about
getting caught?

1483
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,066
You already got caught.

1484
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,087
You didn't wanna take the
Fifth, and what happened?

1485
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,029
You got 18 months.

1486
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,614
- Eighteen months.
- Fourteen.

1487
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,282
Yeah. Fourteen,
18, same thing.

1488
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,525
And what did we get? Nothing.

1489
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,368
We took the Fifth and
kept our mouths shut.

1490
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:16,330
And that's why they created
the Fifth for people like us.

1491
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,457
And now, I bet you're gonna
be a legitimate citizen

1492
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,167
like these fucking
racketeer senators

1493
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,002
on those fucking committees.

1494
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,671
You wanna be like them? Come
on. You ain't like them.

1495
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:27,090
They're strange people.
They're... They're... They're...

1496
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,717
They're from another planet.

1497
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,802
And they own this
fucking country.

1498
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,430
They're bigger gangsters
than we ever could be,

1499
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:34,556
and you know that.

1500
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,367
And you got this
throat infection?

1501
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,369
What's with this throat
infection, huh?

1502
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,728
What's all that about, huh?

1503
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,563
You tried to talk your
way out of something

1504
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:43,007
you can never talk
your way out of.

1505
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:44,985
All of a sudden you want
to be half in, half out,

1506
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:46,068
half a racketeer.

1507
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,819
You can't have it both ways.

1508
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:49,613
You're either in or you're out.

1509
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,448
And whether you're
half in or half out,

1510
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,635
that don't mean you ain't
gonna get caught the same way

1511
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,202
I could get caught
or I could go down.

1512
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,328
It's the same thing.

1513
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,163
Come on. Don't be naive.

1514
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,123
We don't control this,
somebody else does.

1515
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,500
And then where the fuck are we?

1516
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,751
Way down the ladder.

1517
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:04,795
And I'm telling you,
that can't happen.

1518
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,421
You know that.
It can't happen.

1519
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,006
Vito, Vito, Vito, listen to me

1520
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,509
because this is
a death sentence.

1521
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:15,013
It's a big, big mistake.

1522
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:16,223
Look, you do what you want.

1523
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,992
You want to be a diplomat?
That's your business.

1524
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:20,018
Me? I'm a gangster.

1525
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:23,480
I'm a racketeer. That's it.
That's it. That's the life.

1526
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:30,195
We had
reached a blockade.

1527
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,655
I could see that
there was no way

1528
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:34,449
I was ever gonna change
Vito's mind ever. Ever.

1529
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:36,368
But the fact that he
would try to kill me?

1530
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:38,829
Never, never did
that enter my mind.

1531
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:44,876
I take
out. I don't put in.

1532
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,421
I take
out. I don't put in.

1533
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,840
I take out. I don't put in.

1534
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:55,536
This one's
for you, Frank.

1535
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:59,474
Louis Prima
and Keely Smith, everybody!

1536
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,411
...gotta do some
stuff at the apartment.

1537
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:02,811
...seen who shot you.

1538
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:05,063
He was standing right there.

1539
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:06,481
What happens now?

1540
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:07,983
I got the message.

1541
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,198
You want company?

1542
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,409
Oh, yeah. Look what happened.

1543
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,245
It's Mandy.

1544
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:22,456
- Mandy surprised me.
- Yeah.

1545
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,625
He made them from leftover
mink from the shop.

1546
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,670
- Very nice. Yeah.
- Aren't they gorgeous? Okay.

1547
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,505
Very thoughtful. You
want me to take them?

1548
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:31,965
Yeah. Take 'em
for a little walk.

1549
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,759
- All right.
- Do you want me to come?

1550
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,552
No, they'll be fine.
We won't be long.

1551
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,305
It's a little chilly out,
but they won't take long.

1552
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,766
I'm... I'm not talking
about the dogs.

1553
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:42,809
Okay.

1554
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,061
Okay.

1555
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,772
Vito knows you wanna quit?

1556
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:48,690
Course he does. That's
all he ever wanted.

1557
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:50,567
That's it. Don't
worry about it.

1558
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,235
Good.

1559
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,780
'Cause that's what
I've wanted for years.

1560
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:57,616
I know, I know, I
know. It's okay.

1561
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:58,700
Be safe.

1562
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,169
Come on.

1563
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:11,546
Come on.

1564
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:13,423
Come on.

1565
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,430
Come on,
already. Come on.

1566
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:22,265
All right, you ready?

1567
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,186
I'm opening the
door. Let's go.

1568
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,396
Let's go, come on.

1569
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,358
As I was walking
through the park,

1570
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,735
I realized a weight was
lifted off my shoulders.

1571
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,112
I sent Richie Boy
to talk with Vito

1572
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,614
to tell him I was stepping away.

1573
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,199
That's it. I'm out.

1574
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,283
And the commission,

1575
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:42,285
they can sort out the
problems with Vito.

1576
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:44,913
Me? I'm just gonna relax.

1577
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:47,958
Travel and enjoy the remaining
years of my life with Bobbie.

1578
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:52,712
Look what she does.

1579
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:55,841
She makes me put
these coats on 'em.

1580
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:58,093
- They're adorable.
- 'Cause they're cold.

1581
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,511
- This guy.
- Yeah.

1582
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,763
- Yeah.
- That's a... Well...

1583
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:04,975
They got a better
life than we do.

1584
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,184
Believe it.

1585
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,603
No arguments.

1586
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,897
So what did he say?

1587
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:12,274
Vito doesn't believe you.

1588
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,733
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1589
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,402
I don't know why he
wouldn't believe me.

1590
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:18,113
Well... I mean, I know him.

1591
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,636
I know what you're
saying, of course.

1592
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:22,284
This is what... This is
the problem with this guy.

1593
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,246
He came home. He
doesn't trust you.

1594
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,166
He took a shot at you
without authorization.

1595
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,753
What's gonna stop him from
taking another shot at you

1596
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,797
without authorization?

1597
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,467
You gotta convince him
that you really wanna quit.

1598
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:41,428
Yeah, yeah. But...

1599
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:45,724
You know what?

1600
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:49,895
Tell him to make the
kid turn himself in.

1601
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:50,812
Huh?

1602
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:53,064
Tell Vito to make
Vincent turn himself in.

1603
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:54,649
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1604
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,295
You know there's a
manhunt out for him.

1605
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:58,153
So what?

1606
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,236
He turns himself in,

1607
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,839
I swear he's not the
person who shot me.

1608
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:02,824
What are they gonna do?
I'm their main witness.

1609
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:04,993
That's it. Case closed.

1610
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,495
'Cause that's about
as solid as it can be.

1611
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,873
I mean, I don't finger the kid.

1612
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:13,168
That's it. He walks.
Everybody's...

1613
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,420
Everybody's okay.

1614
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:18,548
Kid goes home. Vito
takes over, finally.

1615
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:20,842
I'm outta here. I'm
retired. That's it.

1616
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:22,969
That's it.

1617
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:24,596
Take that back to them.

1618
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,389
And make sure that
Vito makes sure

1619
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:28,558
that the kid brings a
bondsman with him too,

1620
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:29,643
besides his lawyer,

1621
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:30,806
and that the cops know when

1622
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,270
and where exactly
they're gonna meet

1623
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:33,605
so there's no fuck-up.

1624
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,650
Okay, I'll bring it to
him and get back to you.

1625
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:37,734
All right.

1626
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:42,489
It's a nice day.

1627
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:46,451
Little chilly. It's
too cold for the dogs.

1628
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,870
Dogs got the life.
Look at... Here.

1629
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:50,621
Put 'em in coats.

1630
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,082
I'm afraid I'm gonna get robbed.

1631
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:54,185
I'm walking in the park,
somebody gonna steal the...

1632
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,045
...not only the coats,
but the dogs too.

1633
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,339
She'll kill me. I'll
never be able to go home.

1634
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,423
Oh, God.

1635
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:02,342
That's all Bobbie
needs for me to do.

1636
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,803
It's these damn dogs.
Everything is them.

1637
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,137
- Yeah. Listen...
- You know.

1638
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:07,222
They're our children.

1639
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:09,766
- Look at that dog.
- Yeah.

1640
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:12,519
Okay, good.

1641
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:34,958
- Hey, Cheech.
- Hey.

1642
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,835
- Hey.
- Hey. Yeah.

1643
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:38,628
Let me see this.

1644
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:41,131
Look what that
animal did to you.

1645
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,441
- What are these?
- Some flowers.

1646
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,465
Those are for you.

1647
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:44,718
- For me?
- Sure.

1648
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,971
That's so nice of you.
Gee. Al.

1649
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,223
- So you're walking away?
- Yep.

1650
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,766
You okayed the kid coming back?

1651
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:52,851
Yep. Yeah.

1652
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,562
You know, for me,
Albert, it's...

1653
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,105
I don't want no more surprises.

1654
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,607
Jesus Christ, Frank.
You can't walk away.

1655
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,570
It's over. I don't...
I gotta...

1656
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,405
Can't be over. What
he did was wrong.

1657
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,490
I know it was wrong.
But so what? Sit down.

1658
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:08,908
It does matter.

1659
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,119
He went against
the rules. Okay?

1660
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,662
I mean, without the rules,

1661
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:14,330
it's just cowboys and
Indians out there.

1662
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:15,749
The rules aren't around anymore.

1663
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,472
It's different now.
It's a different time.

1664
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,544
Maybe it's different for
you. Not different for me.

1665
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,671
For me, it still matters
what that cocksucker did.

1666
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,006
Let me take him out.

1667
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,717
Problem solved. Then
back to nice and orderly.

1668
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,510
Your way of doing business.

1669
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:28,928
Look. Look...

1670
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:30,346
Nothing happened.

1671
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,806
I didn't get
killed. He missed.

1672
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,475
I'm here, I'm talking.

1673
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,226
It's all right. It's
all right. It...

1674
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:36,811
I don't want to get killed

1675
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:38,414
for something that I
don't want no more.

1676
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,356
What are you talking about?

1677
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,501
If anybody's gonna get
killed, it's not gonna be you.

1678
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,235
No. I don't want
nobody killed.

1679
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:45,320
Come on.

1680
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:48,656
I don't want nobody killed.

1681
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:50,784
Okay?

1682
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,369
Okay.

1683
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:55,830
Listen, you take care of
that lump on your head.

1684
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:56,748
All right.

1685
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,208
I'll take care of
everything else.

1686
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,168
And until I get this
straightened out,

1687
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,711
start carrying a piece.

1688
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:03,463
Thanks
for the flowers.

1689
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:05,590
I'll see you out.

1690
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:08,402
- Hi.
- That was Albert?

1691
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,928
Yeah, he just came by to see me.

1692
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,055
Say hello, see how
I'm doing. That's all.

1693
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,057
He brought flowers.

1694
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,352
That was nice of him.

1695
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,106
- Are you all right?
- Everything's fine.

1696
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:22,774
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

1697
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:12,615
Please,
Albert. Before we start,

1698
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,659
I know you're asking questions.

1699
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,077
It's been discussed.

1700
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:17,537
What are you talking about?

1701
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,122
What's
done is done.

1702
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,207
It's being considered
as an internal thing

1703
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,792
within their own family.

1704
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,836
It's for Frank and
Vito to decide.

1705
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,171
And nobody else.

1706
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:28,298
The man went against
his own boss.

1707
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,718
Frank's only the boss
because Vito gave it to him.

1708
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,261
You remember that, Albert.

1709
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:36,222
It's not like Vito wasn't
the boss before Frank.

1710
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:37,140
Right?

1711
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:40,727
Plus, Richie says Frank agreed
to walk away on his own.

1712
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,770
- Right?
- You gotta respect that.

1713
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:45,481
Yeah, well, Frank
agreed to too much.

1714
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,275
Jesus Christ. After
what happened,

1715
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,485
I shouldn't even have
to ask for an okay.

1716
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,321
But it's none of our business.

1717
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,740
You're getting involved
where it's not necessary.

1718
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,450
It's for their own
family to decide.

1719
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:56,659
Not to me.

1720
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:57,869
To me, it's black-and-white.

1721
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,288
The man took a shot
at his own boss.

1722
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,474
- That's a death sentence.
- Albert. Please.

1723
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,083
Nobody died here.

1724
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,211
Nobody has to rush
into anything.

1725
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,272
If Vito doesn't know what
he fucking did was wrong,

1726
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:09,816
then Vito doesn't
know a goddamn thing.

1727
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:11,799
- Come on. Come on.
- Albert.

1728
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:13,384
Hey, just stop.

1729
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:15,011
- Be calm, all right?
- Calm?

1730
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,387
And what, are you all stupid?

1731
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:18,598
You don't nip this in the bud,

1732
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,226
who's to say one of your
own won't come after you?

1733
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:22,936
You let him get away with this,

1734
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,312
it's a green light
for everybody.

1735
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:27,106
Enough. Enough.

1736
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,274
We already voted.

1737
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:32,195
Richie said Frank himself
voted with the three of us.

1738
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,154
That's it.

1739
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:35,448
The four of us against
the one of you.

1740
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,783
That's the rules.

1741
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,785
- If you want your rules.
- Yeah?

1742
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:42,121
And nobody's made a move
on a boss until last week.

1743
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,290
Until last week!

1744
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,751
Somebody made a move on a boss!

1745
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,295
Tell me I'm wrong.

1746
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:51,130
Go ahead, come on. Tell me.

1747
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,882
Tell me. Tell me I'm wrong.

1748
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:57,887
After what he did, I
don't even need an okay.

1749
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:01,224
You make a move on a boss,
it's an open contract.

1750
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:02,767
And every one of you know it.

1751
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,107
You...

1752
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,444
Albert, get
back here. Get back here.

1753
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:14,713
Where
are you going?

1754
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,540
Can you believe
this is a big hit?

1755
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,251
- Times are changing.
- Yeah.

1756
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,546
You've been sitting in
front of this TV all day.

1757
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:32,922
Are you okay?

1758
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:35,758
Yeah, yeah. I'm just... I'm
practicing early retirement.

1759
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,594
I wish.

1760
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,638
We
interrupt this broadcast

1761
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:42,015
with a special news bulletin.

1762
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:45,601
Vincent Gigante, the
28-year-old fugitive gunman

1763
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,520
wanted for questioning
in connection

1764
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,189
with last month's botched
assassination attempt

1765
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:53,067
of New York's alleged
crime boss Frank Costello,

1766
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,944
has turned himself in.

1767
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:58,031
We now return you to your
regularly scheduled program.

1768
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:00,283
You knew.

1769
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:05,413
I hoped.

1770
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:08,624
He'll be in charge?

1771
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,044
Well, that's the point.

1772
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:13,629
You trust him?

1773
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,631
This is everything
he's ever wanted.

1774
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,967
Well, he's gotten
everything he wanted before.

1775
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,802
Yeah, well...

1776
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:22,430
that was love.
This is business.

1777
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:38,279
Mr. Keith, I'm pointing
directly to the defendant.

1778
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:40,156
A Mr. Vincent Gigante.

1779
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,616
Is that the man you encountered

1780
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,493
the day Mr. Costello was shot?

1781
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:46,287
I-I can't say for sure.

1782
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,582
You identified him to
the police that night.

1783
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah, but he looks
different now.

1784
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:55,004
Are you having difficulty
identifying the defendant?

1785
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:55,922
Yes, that's right.

1786
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,883
Is it true that you are
legally blind in the right eye

1787
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:00,843
and severely impaired
in the other?

1788
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,804
- One or two?
- Two.

1789
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:03,971
That's what my doctor said.

1790
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:05,515
May I respectfully offer

1791
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:08,601
Mr. Keith's ophthalmologist
report to the court?

1792
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,686
- One or two?
- Two.

1793
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:13,022
Can you at least
admit someone shot you?

1794
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:14,106
Yes.

1795
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,818
- He tried to take your life.
- Yes.

1796
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,361
He called out your name.

1797
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:20,113
Yes.

1798
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,407
You were approximately
six feet away from him.

1799
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,450
Then how could you
not have seen him?

1800
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:27,120
My head was turned.

1801
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:31,165
We find the
defendant, Vincent Gigante,

1802
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:33,418
not guilty on all charges.

1803
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,503
We'd like to thank the
jurors for your service.

1804
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,004
The jury is dismissed.

1805
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:42,319
I don't know what to say, Frank.

1806
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:44,595
- Thank you.
- Okay, kid. Don't worry.

1807
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:46,597
You're a good man,
Frank. Thank you.

1808
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:48,349
- You shook his hand.
- So what?

1809
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:50,726
He tried to ki... He
tried to kill you, Frank.

1810
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,104
He's just a messenger,
George. Come on.

1811
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,742
Hey.

1812
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:10,856
- He did the right thing, huh?
- Hey, come here. Come here.

1813
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,308
Vincent, what
are you talking about?

1814
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,835
Did what right? What right?
"Did the right thing."

1815
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:16,998
What are you talking about?

1816
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,713
He did the right
thing for himself.

1817
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:20,840
What are you talking
about? "The right thing."

1818
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,802
Yeah, sure, but I'm still...
I'm outside, you know.

1819
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:26,137
You're outside.
You're outside.

1820
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,014
You're walking. You're
still walking around.

1821
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,516
You know who else is
still walking around? Huh?

1822
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,894
Who else? Huh? Huh?

1823
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:34,270
Keep your mouth shut.

1824
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:36,230
Who else is still
walking around, huh?

1825
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,107
Yeah, all right.

1826
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:40,735
With Vinny free,
my retirement looked good.

1827
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:42,445
If only I could
keep Albert quiet

1828
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,238
until Vito got picked
up for trafficking.

1829
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:45,591
We have
plenty of coffee

1830
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:47,283
for anyone who wants a refill.

1831
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,702
We're gonna be in
the other room.

1832
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:50,786
Let's go on in.

1833
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:04,008
So, I'm gonna need a favor.

1834
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:06,594
Anything.

1835
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,137
Not that.

1836
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,556
What?

1837
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,808
I need you to go somewhere.

1838
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:14,143
Me?

1839
01:20:14,227 --> 01:20:15,770
Yeah, sure, just me.

1840
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:17,897
And where am I supposed to go?

1841
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:21,400
- Cuba.
- What are you talking about?

1842
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:26,572
The feds are onto Vito
with the narcotics thing,

1843
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:28,533
so there's gonna
be a grand jury.

1844
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:30,368
You're gonna be on
that witness list.

1845
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:32,078
Goddamn it.

1846
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,163
Goddamn it, I knew it.

1847
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:35,915
I told you that fucking peddler

1848
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,792
was gonna fuck things
up for everybody.

1849
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,630
You know about
Albert going to Cuba?

1850
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,924
- Yeah, that's what I hear.
- Yeah.

1851
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,425
Why's he going there?

1852
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,636
You didn't hear?
You didn't know?

1853
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:49,720
Nah.

1854
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,014
I...

1855
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:54,392
Everybody knew. I
just assumed you knew.

1856
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,311
Well, why's he going to Cuba?

1857
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,564
That's why you gotta be away.

1858
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,400
No extradition. No subpoena.

1859
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,527
No grand jury. Nothing
where there's...

1860
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,945
The only place is Havana.

1861
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,029
You're serious?

1862
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,393
You can do everything down there

1863
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,550
the way you do it over here.

1864
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:11,117
There's gonna be no
problem with that.

1865
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,368
That can be worked out.

1866
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,704
You want me to move
all the way to Cuba?

1867
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,456
It's a 35-minute
plane ride from Miami.

1868
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,709
Hey, it's nothing. It's...

1869
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,169
The important thing is that
you're out of the country.

1870
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,922
You're a million miles
from the grand jury.

1871
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,006
You understand?

1872
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,758
Frank's getting
him out of the way

1873
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,719
as an offering to you.

1874
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,762
Well, to let you know

1875
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:34,223
that he's giving
away his protection.

1876
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:36,767
And what happens to you if
I'm all the way down there?

1877
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:39,520
Me? I'm... I'm gonna retire.

1878
01:21:39,604 --> 01:21:41,897
I am retired. I'm
outta here. I'm gone.

1879
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,150
I told you before that
it's... That's what it is.

1880
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,234
I'm gonna go to Rome.

1881
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,653
Have a nice dinner right
after I turn it over to him.

1882
01:21:47,737 --> 01:21:49,864
Yeah, well, why's he
sending him down there?

1883
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,324
Well, where's he gonna send him?

1884
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,618
I don't know. Why there?
Why-Why not Brazil?

1885
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:55,119
Why not someplace further away

1886
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,746
like where there's
an ocean between us?

1887
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,289
Why's he sending him so close?

1888
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,041
Well, Cuba's a nice place.

1889
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,085
You never thought that Cuba
was more than just that?

1890
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:05,254
- There's gambling down there.
- Yeah.

1891
01:22:05,338 --> 01:22:07,340
You never thought it might
be that? The gambling?

1892
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,258
I mean, that's what I think.

1893
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,636
He's up to something.

1894
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:15,014
When he's getting indicted,
you're gonna be in Havana.

1895
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:15,931
Uh-huh.

1896
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,495
You're gonna be away
from all of this.

1897
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,189
All right. Commission
is gonna be looking

1898
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,149
for somebody to take over.

1899
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,486
You know what I mean?

1900
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,660
I told 'em you are the
best person for this.

1901
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,329
Somebody like you who'll
play by the rules.

1902
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:39,413
You do the right thing.

1903
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:42,166
You're away in Havana,
you do your own business.

1904
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,336
Low-key. Stay out of trouble.

1905
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,382
You show them what
you're capable of.

1906
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,011
I...

1907
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,472
I proposed you.

1908
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,058
You understand?

1909
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:02,895
I vouched for you.

1910
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:07,858
When do you want me to go?

1911
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:09,819
Soon as you can.

1912
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,904
He's looking to fuck
me. I'm telling you.

1913
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,489
I don't know. I don't
see it that way.

1914
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,533
He's looking to make me
look like a morto di fame.

1915
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,326
- I know this guy.
- No. I don't think so.

1916
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,453
I know Frank the way
you don't know him.

1917
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:21,414
I know Frank. He's
up to something.

1918
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:23,416
Tony...

1919
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:27,712
There's something going on.

1920
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,966
Okay, you can help.
You can help. Go ahead.

1921
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,487
- Okay.
- How you doing, sir?

1922
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,263
Hey, zingarella. Come here.

1923
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,724
I'll be back soon, okay?

1924
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,434
Make sure you take
care of your mother.

1925
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,352
- Easy.
- Help her out. Okay, good.

1926
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,980
All right, sweetheart.
I'm not gonna be too long.

1927
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:47,440
- I'll see you, okay?
- I love you.

1928
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,000
- Make sure they wrap that up.
- I will.

1929
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,085
- Wrap it good.
- All right.

1930
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:51,461
...batter's box.

1931
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:52,486
Slightly open stance.

1932
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:53,922
The outfield pulls
around the left for him.

1933
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:54,780
The check to the runner,

1934
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,490
the delivery, outside
with a curveball.

1935
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:57,574
Ball one.

1936
01:23:58,534 --> 01:23:59,535
We gotta go.

1937
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:02,580
So, the Milwaukee
fans who came here to cheer

1938
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,999
are waiting now with
a little concern

1939
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:08,085
as Bob Buhl has a little
trouble finding that plate.

1940
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,963
Mantle with a big lead,
throw back to second.

1941
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,382
The ball gets by Schoendienst
and goes out to center field.

1942
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:15,384
As Mantle goes to get
up, Schoendienst spills

1943
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:17,386
and the throw is to second
as Berra comes over.

1944
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,096
He's safe, and
Mantle's safe at third.

1945
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,476
Schoendienst calls for time.

1946
01:24:24,769 --> 01:24:27,104
The throw was on
the right-field side

1947
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:28,022
of second base,

1948
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:29,857
and as Schoendienst
went for the throw,

1949
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:30,940
he was not able to...

1950
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:31,984
Give me an hour.

1951
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,861
Take your time.
There's no rush.

1952
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:36,155
And it will be an
error charged to the pitcher,

1953
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:39,116
allowing Mickey
Mantle to get to third

1954
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,118
and Berra to get to first.

1955
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:43,788
...to try and shut the door.

1956
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:45,581
Infield drawn-in for the Braves.

1957
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:47,875
Here's the 1-1 delivery.

1958
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:50,294
Swings and hits a fly ball
deep into left-center field.

1959
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,465
He falls down,
he drops the ball.

1960
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,467
And here comes Mickey
Mantle in to score.

1961
01:24:58,552 --> 01:24:59,678
Aaron fell down...

1962
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,059
Good.
Thank you, honey.

1963
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:07,228
They're so good. Thank you.

1964
01:25:08,521 --> 01:25:10,648
And the fans are
oohing and aahing now

1965
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:12,900
as what looked
like sure disaster

1966
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,819
for the Braves recovered,

1967
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,320
and a run comes home.

1968
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,658
So it's a 2-nothing ball
game. New York leading.

1969
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,035
The outfield straightaway.

1970
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,554
Deep in the right
side of the infield

1971
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:25,830
is Schoendienst and Adcock.

1972
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:27,433
Pitch, slow grounder
to the right side.

1973
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:29,583
Coming over for it is
Buhl. It's rolling. Foul.

1974
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,923
Simpson and Buhl sort of
had a semi-collision in...

1975
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,467
You're gonna
love our new house.

1976
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:40,427
You're gonna be so happy.

1977
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:42,429
Good boy.

1978
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,099
Look
at your sister.

1979
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:47,059
Covington in
left, Aaron in center,

1980
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,143
Hazle in right.

1981
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,687
Mathews at third,
Logan at short.

1982
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,330
Schoendienst at second,
Adcock at first.

1983
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:52,597
Look to the runner, the pitch.

1984
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,567
Swung on, a bouncer
back to second.

1985
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,902
Going over is Schoendienst.
He knocks the ball down.

1986
01:25:56,986 --> 01:25:59,256
Here comes Berra to the plate,
and the throw is coming in.

1987
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,490
Thank you. Here...
I'll put them here.

1988
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:05,452
...for New York.

1989
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:07,872
As Harry Simpson
hits a high bouncer

1990
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:09,874
back to the mound,
out over second base.

1991
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:11,250
Schoendienst knocked it down.

1992
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:14,879
Made a good play on the ball,
but not able to make a throw.

1993
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:17,214
And coming home is Yogi Berra.

1994
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:19,174
So, Simpson drives in a...

1995
01:26:45,993 --> 01:26:47,137
...swinging
that lumber.

1996
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:49,204
Here's the 1-1 pitch to him.

1997
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:50,331
All right.

1998
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:52,499
All right, yeah.

1999
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,743
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear anything.

2000
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,054
What is it?

2001
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:06,764
Albert.

2002
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,100
He's gone. He's gone.

2003
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:13,520
Oh, my God. What happened?

2004
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:16,857
He listened to me.

2005
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:19,109
Trusted what I said.

2006
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:22,196
And he thought he was okay.

2007
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:25,699
You can't blame yourself
for what other people do.

2008
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:28,535
I gotta blame myself
for what I did.

2009
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:33,832
Should I call Elsa?

2010
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,752
Yeah, yeah. Just tell her...

2011
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:40,965
Tell her I gotta figure
this out, and...

2012
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:43,092
and get ready to
go to her mother's

2013
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:47,388
in Toronto with the kids,
uh, right after the funeral.

2014
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:51,558
I knew with Albert gone,
staying alive was a long shot.

2015
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,018
But with Vito, I also knew

2016
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:55,521
that a long shot was usually
the only shot you got.

2017
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,356
So, I was gonna take it.

2018
01:27:57,982 --> 01:27:59,733
So I needed a plan.

2019
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:02,111
But the big question
was, "What plan?"

2020
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:04,822
I needed to find a
way to take Vito out,

2021
01:28:05,406 --> 01:28:07,199
but without it
coming back to me.

2022
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:24,675
He loved you. He loved you.

2023
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:49,366
We'll go in here.

2024
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,410
Yeah, it's best
nobody overhears us.

2025
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:53,829
Uh, good place
to be.

2026
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,123
Nobody's listening.

2027
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,125
So I gotta...

2028
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,004
I don't know.

2029
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,340
I should've seen it coming.
I don't know what...

2030
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,009
What did
you expect from him?

2031
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:08,927
A lot of people are afraid.

2032
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:12,014
What they say, in front
of him or behind his back.

2033
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:16,310
- You know Vito doesn't care.
- Yeah.

2034
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,604
- He don't care about anything.
- I care.

2035
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:23,108
'Cause I don't get out until
he gets in, so that's...

2036
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,237
You're my main
concern right now.

2037
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:30,574
Uh, it's like we're
back where we started.

2038
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:31,742
Back on the street.

2039
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,535
Back where we...
The whole thing.

2040
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,996
Frank, he never left the street.

2041
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,058
He's always been in the street.

2042
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,082
Yeah.

2043
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,044
He's got no class,
that guy. Please.

2044
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:43,629
It's like we're...

2045
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:45,714
Nobody learns anything.

2046
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:46,632
Stomping around

2047
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,259
like we're about to be extinct
dinosaurs...

2048
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:51,678
We never even know when
we're dying. This is...

2049
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:55,516
Anybody that goes against Vito,

2050
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,185
he'll start a war.
He'll go against 'em.

2051
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:01,480
You gotta do something.

2052
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:03,649
Anything.

2053
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,397
It's not your fault.
Who could have thought?

2054
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,071
Who could have imagined?

2055
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,532
- Never.
- In... In broad daylight.

2056
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,909
In a barbershop. Who would
have thought of that?

2057
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:14,993
Nobody.

2058
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,413
- But you have to be brave.
- Okay.

2059
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:20,207
- Right? You're brave.
- Yeah.

2060
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,126
You've gotta be
brave for the kids.

2061
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:26,880
You know what I wanna do? I
wanna whistle everybody in.

2062
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:31,260
- What?
- I wanna have a... a meeting.

2063
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:33,720
- We had it at my place.
- I know.

2064
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,014
- They didn't go for it.
- Nah. That was the five of us.

2065
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,266
I'm talking about everybody.

2066
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,226
I'm talking about a
national commission.

2067
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,204
There hasn't been a
commission meeting

2068
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:42,563
in 30 years since Lucky.

2069
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:43,981
Yeah, I know, I know. I know.

2070
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:45,899
That's why I think
Vito might go for it.

2071
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:47,568
'Cause he always
wants to do something

2072
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:49,027
the way Lucky did it.

2073
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,488
And this way, when
we have this meeting,

2074
01:30:51,572 --> 01:30:53,490
I turn it all over to him
in front of everybody.

2075
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:56,410
I couldn't take it back
even if I wanted to.

2076
01:30:56,994 --> 01:30:58,871
Plus, you know,
once he's got it,

2077
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,372
we have to do whatever he says.

2078
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:01,790
- I know that.
- He's the boss.

2079
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:04,334
And you know what
I'm talking about.

2080
01:31:04,418 --> 01:31:05,669
Rich, I know that.

2081
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:08,964
But it's, for me,
what I have to do.

2082
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,591
So all I'm saying...

2083
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:13,260
I need you to set it up.

2084
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,804
Would you do that?

2085
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:17,556
Where do you wanna do it?

2086
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,892
What about Joe
Barbara? He's a...

2087
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:21,351
How's he doing?
Is he all right?

2088
01:31:21,435 --> 01:31:22,561
Barbara?

2089
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:25,063
He's okay, Joe, he
had a heart thing.

2090
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:28,609
But he's got a farm upstate.
Way upstate. Almost by Canada.

2091
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:31,320
And he's got all
farms around him.

2092
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:33,280
It's peaceful. It's quiet.

2093
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:34,698
It's a perfect place.

2094
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:35,866
Well, all right.

2095
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:37,492
All right. Let's set that up.

2096
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:39,870
- I'll set it up. Right there.
- Hopefully, if we can.

2097
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:42,164
But I told you, everybody's
gotta listen to him.

2098
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,415
I know.

2099
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,958
He's gonna be the boss.

2100
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:46,960
Even me, Frank.

2101
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,087
You know what I'm talking about.

2102
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:52,609
I didn't wanna
tell Richie Boy anything

2103
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:55,302
because it was better for him
if he didn't know anything.

2104
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,013
The less he knew, the better.

2105
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:16,657
I bite my tongue. And
my wife, she shops.

2106
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:19,576
She does this, she does
that. She plans every minute.

2107
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:21,995
I like the Giants too.

2108
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:24,873
I'm not always gonna bet on
the Giants is what I'm saying.

2109
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:28,335
No people. Where's
all the people?

2110
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,337
Back home, I go outside, I...

2111
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,005
I see people. I talk to 'em.

2112
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:33,465
Lot of trees.

2113
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:34,758
Beautiful trees, but...

2114
01:32:35,509 --> 01:32:36,551
no people.

2115
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:42,975
Okay. Oka... Yes.

2116
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,559
Okay.

2117
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:49,690
It's the doorman again.

2118
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:51,316
He says that
Richie's been waiting

2119
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,235
for so long that the
cops want him to leave.

2120
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:55,320
All right. Well, tell
him I'll be right down.

2121
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:57,072
Are you sure you have to go?

2122
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,156
Yeah, I have to.

2123
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:00,659
You'll only have
Richie with you.

2124
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:02,327
That's all right.
That's all right.

2125
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:05,080
It could be a trap.

2126
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,416
Nah, nah. It's too
late for traps, honey.

2127
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,836
I'm gonna be fine. You'll
see. It's all right.

2128
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:26,935
Come on. What, are you...
What, are you nuts?

2129
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:28,520
Course he's up to something.

2130
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:30,397
I don't understand.

2131
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,500
- This is different this time.
- What, did you forget?

2132
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:33,358
He stole from me before.

2133
01:33:33,442 --> 01:33:34,961
He was my friend. He
knifed me in the back.

2134
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,462
You say, "How could he
be up to something"?

2135
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:38,405
That's all in the past.
This is different.

2136
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:39,848
He takes
people for suckers.

2137
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:41,426
He didn't take
you for a sucker.

2138
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:42,826
He takes people
for suckers. Tony.

2139
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,620
In-In all the time
since he's been shot,

2140
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:47,456
what has he done? Tell me.

2141
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:49,499
Nothing. That's
what he's done.

2142
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:50,917
What does that tell you?

2143
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:53,104
Nevertheless, I just want
you to watch him. That's all.

2144
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,171
What's he gonna do?

2145
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:55,630
How do I know what
he's gonna do...

2146
01:33:55,714 --> 01:33:57,466
He'll do something.
That, I know.

2147
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:59,509
He thinks around
corners, this guy.

2148
01:33:59,593 --> 01:34:00,594
Just watch him.

2149
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:03,055
I'm telling you, he's
not gonna try anything.

2150
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:04,139
Well...

2151
01:34:05,474 --> 01:34:07,059
How do you know
what he's gonna do?

2152
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:09,603
Me? What the hell do
I know? I don't know.

2153
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:11,146
Well, yeah. How do you know?

2154
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:12,898
You just said you
knew. I just heard you.

2155
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:15,817
You ain't been talking to
him or nothing like that?

2156
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,694
- Huh?
- You had no contact with him?

2157
01:34:17,778 --> 01:34:19,696
- I ain't been near the prick.
- With Frank?

2158
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,906
All I'm saying is that,

2159
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,699
without Albert,
he's got no bullets.

2160
01:34:22,783 --> 01:34:24,201
You'll have the upper hand.

2161
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,078
We drive up, he kisses the ring,

2162
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,955
you're the boss.
You're in charge.

2163
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:31,333
And then, Vito, we do
whatever the fuck we want.

2164
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,543
Yeah, that...
Well, that's...

2165
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,098
We're gonna be late.

2166
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:50,143
Oh.

2167
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,978
Look. It's Palmyra.

2168
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,022
- Huh.
- Palmyra?

2169
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,650
- What about "Palmera"?
- "Palmyra."

2170
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:57,933
"Palmyra."
"Palmera." Whatever.

2171
01:34:57,984 --> 01:34:59,778
- Palmyra, New York. It's...
- What happened?

2172
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:00,922
What are you talking about?

2173
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:02,226
It's where the
Mormons come from.

2174
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,050
The Mormons are from Utah.
Everybody knows that.

2175
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:04,908
They own Utah.

2176
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,803
- Where do you get this stuff?
- Don't you know that?

2177
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:07,970
No, I'm telling you. Palmyra.

2178
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:08,829
Nah, nah, nah.

2179
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:10,288
That's where they got started.

2180
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,207
It's where the Mormons
found their gold bible.

2181
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,208
It was buried up here.

2182
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,502
That's how they started
the whole fucking religion.

2183
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:16,896
All right, let me
get this straight.

2184
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,256
The Mormons, they dug up
a gold bible in "Palmera,"

2185
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,049
and then they stopped digging,

2186
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:23,468
and then they moved the
covered wagons out to Utah

2187
01:35:23,552 --> 01:35:25,554
and started a religion in
the middle of the desert?

2188
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:27,740
Ye... That's how they started
the whole fucking religion.

2189
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,224
That's what
you're saying?

2190
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:31,035
- That's what I know.
- That's what you know.

2191
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,227
Well, you don't know nothing.

2192
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,146
If somebody digs up a gold bible

2193
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,331
in Palmyra or anywheres else,

2194
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,649
they're gonna stay right there
and keep on digging, right?

2195
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:38,918
- Right.
- Wouldn't you?

2196
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:40,837
- Yeah, Vito...
- I know I would. Right?

2197
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:41,695
Vito's right.

2198
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,488
Keep looking for
more gold bibles.

2199
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:45,365
Vito, nobody
gives a shit.

2200
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:46,950
I'm trying
to be logical here.

2201
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:48,160
Who's gonna leave a place

2202
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:49,703
after they just
dug up a gold bible

2203
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,931
and move all the way to the
middle of the fucking desert?

2204
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:54,499
Who? Name me somebody
who's gonna do that.

2205
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:55,500
Huh?

2206
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:57,335
Well, I wouldn't. I wouldn't.

2207
01:35:57,419 --> 01:35:58,980
- Name me somebody.
- I'd stay there.

2208
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:00,273
- Name me somebody.
- Keep digging.

2209
01:36:00,297 --> 01:36:02,340
- Who, you? Me? Who?
- I don't know, the Mormons.

2210
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:03,734
Never knows what
he's talking about.

2211
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:04,593
Who's gonna do that?

2212
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,028
You know what? I'm
gonna tell you who.

2213
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:08,430
The same dumb motherfucker

2214
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:10,313
who fucked up the only
thing he ever had to do

2215
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:11,766
in his whole fucking life.

2216
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,852
And now he's forcing
me, making me,

2217
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:15,312
to have to lower myself

2218
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,855
in front of that rat cocksucker

2219
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:18,773
and beg for what's already mine.

2220
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:20,692
Whoa, whoa.

2221
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,986
- Tony. Tony, make him stop.
- Hey, Vito, Vito.

2222
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:24,654
Stop. I'm gonna
bang into somebody.

2223
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:26,156
You're gonna get
us all killed here.

2224
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,491
You fucked it up.

2225
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:28,575
Fuck the Mormons.

2226
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:30,785
You're telling me about
gold bibles and Palmyra?

2227
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:31,929
Shut the fuck up about bibles.

2228
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:33,997
Learn how to shoot
straight, you dumb fuck.

2229
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,332
Fucking bibles.

2230
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:37,918
You had one fucking
bullet, you fucking missed.

2231
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:41,254
Bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang.

2232
01:36:41,338 --> 01:36:42,255
Huh?

2233
01:36:42,339 --> 01:36:44,049
One, two, three,
four, five. Six.

2234
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:44,966
Can you count?

2235
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,384
The elevator door
was gonna open.

2236
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:48,595
So what? So what? Somebody's
in there, bang, bang.

2237
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:49,513
There you go.

2238
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:50,907
What are we talking
about with you?

2239
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:51,848
Jesus Christ.

2240
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:53,558
Nobody gives a fuck
about the Mormons.

2241
01:36:53,642 --> 01:36:56,186
I'll give you fucking Palmyra,
you fucking knucklehead.

2242
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:58,355
- Say something smart for once.
- Exactly.

2243
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,065
Where do you get your
information from?

2244
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,250
- Ma told me.
- "Ma told me."

2245
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,434
It's stupid. I'm sure your
mother didn't tell you that.

2246
01:37:03,485 --> 01:37:04,319
She did tell me.

2247
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,029
Forget about the
fucking Mormons.

2248
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:08,365
Just get us over there.
Get us the fuck outta here.

2249
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:10,742
We're driving to a
summit. It's your summit.

2250
01:37:11,535 --> 01:37:13,328
Relax. Enjoy it.

2251
01:37:39,396 --> 01:37:40,480
Everybody all right?

2252
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:43,400
- Gentlemen, my wife Vickie.
- Hi. Hey.

2253
01:37:43,483 --> 01:37:44,710
We're so glad you could be here.

2254
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:45,652
What a beautiful spread.

2255
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:48,071
- That is Joseph Junior.
- Big son.

2256
01:37:48,822 --> 01:37:50,615
This is Ducks over here.
Say hello to Ducks.

2257
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,009
- Hi.
- Hey, heard a lot about youse.

2258
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,261
Help
yourself to the food.

2259
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:54,911
There's so much
there. Eat it up.

2260
01:37:54,995 --> 01:37:57,247
Yeah. It looks
great. Great. Thank you.

2261
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:58,790
Florida?

2262
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:00,959
Miami?

2263
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:03,646
When are you
gonna invite us down?

2264
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:04,504
Whenever you want.

2265
01:38:04,588 --> 01:38:05,856
This guy
never invites us.

2266
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,133
There's Tommy over
here. My wife Vickie.

2267
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,051
Joe Barbara
was the biggest

2268
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:12,178
booze distributor
upstate New York.

2269
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:14,347
For years I was keeping
the State Liquor Authority

2270
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:15,599
off his back.

2271
01:38:15,682 --> 01:38:17,225
It wouldn't take too much

2272
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:19,519
just to send a bunch of nosy
state troopers down there

2273
01:38:19,603 --> 01:38:21,896
snooping around,
messing everything up.

2274
01:38:23,315 --> 01:38:25,692
So State Tax said they
wanted notification

2275
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:27,277
of any activity, right?

2276
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,280
Yeah. I know we all got
the Liquor Authority alert.

2277
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:32,407
I counted 20 cars
going in McFall.

2278
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,034
Big cars. Big trunks.

2279
01:38:34,117 --> 01:38:35,702
Could have been
Canadian contraband

2280
01:38:35,785 --> 01:38:36,620
in every one of 'em.

2281
01:38:36,703 --> 01:38:38,079
We've gotten several
anonymous tips

2282
01:38:38,163 --> 01:38:40,874
that untaxed liquors might be
coming down to Barbara's place

2283
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:41,957
from Canada.

2284
01:38:42,626 --> 01:38:44,628
Yeah. Maybe you're
right about that.

2285
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,171
I'm gonna go up McFall.

2286
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:48,006
I'm gonna get some
plate numbers.

2287
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:50,717
Cover me.

2288
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:59,225
There's a place over
there. Let's get a coffee.

2289
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:02,122
You had coffee not
too long ago, Frank.

2290
01:39:02,187 --> 01:39:03,563
Nah, let's get another coffee.

2291
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:05,273
We'll stretch our
legs, take our time.

2292
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,309
- We're never gonna get there.
- We're gonna get there.

2293
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,903
We don't have to
be there on time.

2294
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:10,820
If you say so.

2295
01:39:10,904 --> 01:39:12,739
- It's okay.
- Okay.

2296
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:14,949
Slow, slow.

2297
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,621
There it is. Route
17. Turn here.

2298
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:21,456
I see it, I see it.

2299
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:22,999
I'm not fucking blind.

2300
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,502
Don't get him started.

2301
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:27,379
Just make the turn.

2302
01:39:46,356 --> 01:39:48,191
I don't wanna
be there for too long.

2303
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,777
- Are you serious?
- I told youse.

2304
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,987
In and out. Hello,
goodbye. That's it.

2305
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:54,948
I crown him. Then we're gone.

2306
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:57,033
- Party's for you and him.
- I know him.

2307
01:39:57,117 --> 01:39:59,202
I don't want him to even
think I'm hanging around.

2308
01:39:59,285 --> 01:40:00,120
It's true.

2309
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,264
The more you hang around
and start talking to people,

2310
01:40:02,288 --> 01:40:03,766
he's gonna think
you're up to something.

2311
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:05,041
Exactly. Exactly.

2312
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:06,668
You know, youse
grew up together.

2313
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:07,752
Youse were kids together.

2314
01:40:07,836 --> 01:40:09,421
- You stole together.
- Yeah.

2315
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:10,839
And now you come to this age,

2316
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:13,216
and there's animosity
towards each other?

2317
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:16,469
You know, we were... we did
so many things together.

2318
01:40:16,553 --> 01:40:18,221
When youse were kids,
it was different.

2319
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,597
You know, you
trusted each other.

2320
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,725
But now you're grown men,
and he doesn't trust you.

2321
01:40:21,808 --> 01:40:23,643
- He's dangerous.
- Yeah, I know.

2322
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,395
This guy's a psychopath.

2323
01:40:27,981 --> 01:40:29,691
Yeah, and you gotta
watch what you say.

2324
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:31,401
You gotta watch who
you shake hands with.

2325
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:33,153
You gotta watch who
you kiss on the cheek.

2326
01:40:33,695 --> 01:40:35,780
He thinks it's a
conspiracy against him.

2327
01:40:35,864 --> 01:40:37,824
That's the problem
with those kinda guys.

2328
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:39,743
You know, what
they're paranoid about

2329
01:40:39,826 --> 01:40:41,953
are exactly the
things that they do.

2330
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:43,329
And that... Because they do it,

2331
01:40:43,413 --> 01:40:45,123
they think everybody
else will do it.

2332
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:47,041
And those are the
ones you gotta watch.

2333
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:48,251
Mm-hmm. You're right.

2334
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:53,173
There it
is. McFall Road.

2335
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:55,633
It's about time. I
thought we missed it.

2336
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:07,771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2337
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:09,856
Slow down. Slow down.
Where are you going?

2338
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:12,817
Not too fast. Not too
fast. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2339
01:41:12,901 --> 01:41:14,181
Not up the hill.
Not up the hill.

2340
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:15,236
What are you doing?

2341
01:41:16,029 --> 01:41:19,032
You're gonna get stuck.
You're gonna get stuck.

2342
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:20,450
And how do I get out of the car

2343
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,911
while at an angle over
here? What are you doing?

2344
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:25,038
Back it down. Back it down.

2345
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:27,373
Stop the car, we
get out and we walk.

2346
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:28,792
Put it right
here. That's good.

2347
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:31,294
I'll get
the door for you.

2348
01:41:37,509 --> 01:41:39,594
How do you fucking park?
What's the matter with you?

2349
01:41:42,472 --> 01:41:43,472
Vito.

2350
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:45,767
- Hey.
- You look terrific.

2351
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:48,394
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

2352
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:51,147
My wife Vickie.

2353
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,107
Joseph Junior.

2354
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:55,193
Hey, Joe. Nice to meet you.

2355
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:57,111
It's all fieldstone.

2356
01:41:57,654 --> 01:41:59,447
In the basement,
we got pine knots.

2357
01:41:59,531 --> 01:42:01,008
- The living room...
- What do you got?

2358
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:02,283
Pine knots.

2359
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,786
- Knotty pine.
- Knotty pine, that's right.

2360
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:06,509
What, did you lose your mind?

2361
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:10,291
The living room's 1,600
square feet all by itself.

2362
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:11,292
Nice.

2363
01:42:11,376 --> 01:42:13,461
He insisted on pine paneling.

2364
01:42:13,545 --> 01:42:14,879
Yeah, wood. I get it.

2365
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:16,506
Hey, Joseph, did you
check for the mud?

2366
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:17,423
Yeah, Pa.

2367
01:42:17,507 --> 01:42:18,383
Go out back.

2368
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:20,266
I don't want anybody
getting stuck in the mud.

2369
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:21,803
I know. It's dry.

2370
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,513
I checked this morning myself.

2371
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:26,015
Good. Now, go check it
again. Go make sure.

2372
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:29,143
I gotta do everything myself
around here, Vito. I'm sorry.

2373
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:30,895
You're right.
It's the only way.

2374
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:34,732
Ed, we received another
tip on contraband

2375
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:36,818
coming down from New
York from Canada.

2376
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,028
We traced the call
to a phone booth

2377
01:42:39,112 --> 01:42:40,488
in a bar in Detroit.

2378
01:42:40,572 --> 01:42:41,906
Caller's unknown.

2379
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,991
10-4.

2380
01:42:57,297 --> 01:42:58,817
["Who's Your Little Who-Zis!"

2381
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:09,684
Carl, Carl.

2382
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:12,186
You're always hiding.
Come on, come on.

2383
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:14,898
You're too big to hide.
You can't hide no more.

2384
01:43:14,981 --> 01:43:16,566
As payback
for setting up

2385
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:18,526
the barbershop hit on Albert,

2386
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,446
Gambino was made the new
boss of Albert's family.

2387
01:43:22,071 --> 01:43:24,407
Things are the way they're
supposed to be now.

2388
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,534
- Where's Frank?
- He'll be here.

2389
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,298
He said he didn't wanna
get here too early.

2390
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,569
He said, uh, he didn't wanna
get in the way of anything.

2391
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:31,748
You know Frank.

2392
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:33,791
He said, "This
should be your day."

2393
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:35,585
Always the diplomat.

2394
01:43:35,668 --> 01:43:36,711
Yeah.

2395
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:39,255
This is your day.

2396
01:43:39,339 --> 01:43:40,859
We're so
happy for you, Vito.

2397
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,280
Cops!

2398
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,283
- What's going on?
- Pa, cops!

2399
01:44:07,367 --> 01:44:09,535
- What cops? Where?
- Wait, what is...

2400
01:44:09,619 --> 01:44:11,579
In the field where
you're parked.

2401
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:13,164
They're taking down plates.

2402
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:14,582
What are you talking about?

2403
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:16,501
- I just saw them.
- No!

2404
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:18,020
We were
taught as young kids,

2405
01:44:18,044 --> 01:44:20,964
as soon as you heard the word
"cops," you started running.

2406
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:25,510
They spotted me.
They're gonna take off.

2407
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,637
I don't know what the hell
they're running away for.

2408
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,055
They must be up to something.

2409
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,765
Let's get some
patrol cars up here.

2410
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:32,725
Get their license
and registration.

2411
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:34,644
10-4, uh,
I'll meet you over there

2412
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:36,104
on Route 17 and McFall.

2413
01:44:36,729 --> 01:44:39,023
I am
putting on my party hat.

2414
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:54,038
- Come on. Come on.
- All right.

2415
01:44:54,122 --> 01:44:55,540
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

2416
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,133
Damn it, Joey.

2417
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:06,676
Go, you fat bastard.

2418
01:45:07,385 --> 01:45:09,137
You soft
fucking thing. Come on.

2419
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:15,411
- Open the door. Come on.
- I-I can't find the keys.

2420
01:45:15,435 --> 01:45:17,515
- Let's go. Use your brains.
- You making me nervous.

2421
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:18,396
Calm down.

2422
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:20,279
Listen, you got a piece
on you, get rid of it.

2423
01:45:20,523 --> 01:45:22,167
- What are you doing? Come on.
- I don't understand.

2424
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:23,484
Get it out of the car.

2425
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:27,530
Must
be some accident.

2426
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:29,991
Must be an accident.

2427
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,201
Get rid of it. Throw
it out and let's go.

2428
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:56,851
- Shit.
- Get it out of the mud!

2429
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:57,977
It's not moving.

2430
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:01,606
That's the
second car passed us.

2431
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:02,899
Hold on. Yeah, let's hold on.

2432
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:05,902
Look. "Apple Farms." Pull
off. Let's get some apples.

2433
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:07,403
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

2434
01:46:07,487 --> 01:46:09,322
Besides it's the fall,
it's the apple season.

2435
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:10,406
They got some of the best

2436
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:12,593
McIntosh and Granny Smith
apples in the world up here.

2437
01:46:12,617 --> 01:46:13,618
Come on, pull over.

2438
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:15,036
I didn't know you were a farmer.

2439
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:24,670
License and
registration, please.

2440
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,298
What's going on, Officer?
Somebody rob a bank?

2441
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:28,859
You guys all been
up to Mr. Barbara's?

2442
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:29,985
What are you doing up there?

2443
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:32,345
You know, we don't have to
answer that question. I mean...

2444
01:46:32,428 --> 01:46:34,555
But there's no problem.
I mean, Joe's been sick,

2445
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:36,766
and we've come to wish
him a speedy recovery.

2446
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:38,059
- That's all.
- Yeah.

2447
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:40,019
- We're gonna be late.
- No.

2448
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:43,106
I don't want to be late,
Frank. You want to be late.

2449
01:46:43,189 --> 01:46:45,733
Rich, you can't be
late. It's my party.

2450
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:47,985
You're my guest.
You can't be late.

2451
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:50,571
It's only fucking apples.

2452
01:46:50,655 --> 01:46:51,656
You want some?

2453
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:52,949
Just hurry up, please.

2454
01:46:53,032 --> 01:46:54,033
These are good.

2455
01:46:54,117 --> 01:46:57,537
I'm gonna need to see some
identification. Please.

2456
01:46:58,037 --> 01:46:59,330
Thought you'd never ask.

2457
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:04,127
Any of you guys
got police records?

2458
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:06,504
The only question I'll
answer is how tall I am.

2459
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:07,713
- How tall are you?
- 6'2".

2460
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,800
Your license
says you're 5'8".

2461
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:11,926
Okay. Lock me up.

2462
01:47:17,098 --> 01:47:19,392
Follow the officer's
instructions.

2463
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:26,399
- Hi, sir.
- How you doin'?

2464
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:27,483
Pull around the corner.

2465
01:47:28,151 --> 01:47:29,652
Hey! Hey, stop!

2466
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:41,455
We're at the road, look.
There's a road. Come on.

2467
01:47:41,539 --> 01:47:42,373
Okay.

2468
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:43,684
Maybe we could get
a cab or something.

2469
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:46,586
Yeah. Wave a taxi,
Joe.

2470
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:50,882
Okay? All right?

2471
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:01,017
- Oh, son of a...
- We're pinched.

2472
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,911
- Figlio di sega puttana.
- What is this?

2473
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:04,270
Jesus Christ.

2474
01:48:09,025 --> 01:48:10,193
Hold it right there.

2475
01:48:10,276 --> 01:48:12,716
- What's the problem, Officer?
- We're hunters. We're hunters.

2476
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:23,414
Frank, what's going on here?

2477
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,125
Look at this. They
got the roads blocked.

2478
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:29,003
- Yeah.
- Something happened over here.

2479
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:31,214
Well, let's get through this.

2480
01:48:31,297 --> 01:48:32,423
We take our time.

2481
01:48:33,424 --> 01:48:36,052
Slow we go, slow
we go, you know?

2482
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:37,720
Look.

2483
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:40,473
- Mother of God, Frank, look.
- Yeah, yeah.

2484
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:50,358
All the bosses.

2485
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:53,694
What's going on, Frank?

2486
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:56,280
My God, Frank.

2487
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:58,991
There's Frank Zito and Joey Ida

2488
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:00,534
from Philadelphia.

2489
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:02,161
There's Nick Civella.

2490
01:49:03,412 --> 01:49:06,707
Santo Trafficante. Came
all the way from Havana.

2491
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:14,107
Thinks
around corners, this guy.

2492
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:16,801
Thinks around
corners, this guy.

2493
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:20,972
Frank, what's happening here?

2494
01:49:23,683 --> 01:49:25,184
I don't know.

2495
01:49:27,144 --> 01:49:29,522
I wonder what's
going on. Yeah.

2496
01:49:30,648 --> 01:49:32,525
- Frank, thank God.
- Look at this.

2497
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:33,818
They're not stopping us.

2498
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:38,406
Look at this.

2499
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:40,449
I don't believe this.

2500
01:49:43,703 --> 01:49:45,538
Thank God we were late, Frank.

2501
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:53,879
I don't know, Frank.

2502
01:49:54,547 --> 01:49:56,048
Something don't seem right.

2503
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:01,887
Frank...

2504
01:50:03,389 --> 01:50:04,515
what did you do?

2505
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:15,443
Ed, I'm putting through
Sergeant Salerno.

2506
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:17,611
NYPD Special Services.

2507
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:19,405
10-4.

2508
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:20,489
Yeah, great work, Sarge.

2509
01:50:20,573 --> 01:50:22,259
Uh, what does it look
like you got up there?

2510
01:50:22,283 --> 01:50:23,284
We don't know yet.

2511
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:25,411
We don't even know why they
tried to take off on us.

2512
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:27,413
They were
running all over the field.

2513
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:29,373
Mobsters from all
over the country.

2514
01:50:29,915 --> 01:50:31,834
But I got 63 positive IDs.

2515
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,085
Yeah, yeah. Great work.

2516
01:50:33,169 --> 01:50:36,922
But do you happen to have, um,
a Frank Costello on that list?

2517
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:40,468
- Frank Costello, the big shot?
- That's the one.

2518
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,470
- Wow.
- He's the boss of bosses.

2519
01:50:42,553 --> 01:50:43,596
He has to be there.

2520
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,306
He was probably
running this meeting.

2521
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:48,017
There is no way he's not there.

2522
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:52,021
Uh, sorry. No
good. No Costello.

2523
01:50:52,104 --> 01:50:53,773
Sarge, you
gotta be kidding me.

2524
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:55,316
He has to be up there somewhere.

2525
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:56,984
Maybe he's using another name?

2526
01:50:57,068 --> 01:50:58,778
- What was that name?
- Castiglia.

2527
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:01,572
Castiglia. Or a Frank Saverio?

2528
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:02,656
He's gotta be there.

2529
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,991
He's the boss of all of them.

2530
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:05,076
Uh...

2531
01:51:06,869 --> 01:51:11,624
Sorry. No Castiglia,
and no Saverio.

2532
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:14,335
- Do you need anything else?
- Doesn't make sense.

2533
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,630
They figured it out pretty soon.

2534
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:20,341
With all the licenses
and registrations

2535
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:21,424
the troopers took,

2536
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:23,594
they finally figured out

2537
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,347
that the Mafia was a
nationwide crime organization.

2538
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:33,479
Up to that time,
J. Edgar Hoover, FBI chief,

2539
01:51:34,563 --> 01:51:37,608
denied that organized
crime was nationwide.

2540
01:51:38,442 --> 01:51:40,444
But because of the
Apalachin thing,

2541
01:51:40,528 --> 01:51:42,238
all of a sudden everybody knew.

2542
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:43,781
It was all over the papers.

2543
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:45,616
So now he had to acknowledge it.

2544
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:47,660
So he began to
prosecute everybody.

2545
01:51:47,743 --> 01:51:50,454
Like a bunch of dominoes, it
brought the whole thing down.

2546
01:51:51,372 --> 01:51:54,166
And I was very careful.
I left no fingerprints.

2547
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:04,718
In fact, the only secret
today that remains unanswered

2548
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:07,179
is how a bunch of uneducated

2549
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:08,889
juvenile delinquent immigrants,

2550
01:52:08,973 --> 01:52:10,933
who didn't even speak
English when they got here,

2551
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:12,143
managed to put together

2552
01:52:12,226 --> 01:52:14,103
a multi-billion dollar
national syndicate

2553
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:16,647
without the cops or
politicians knowing about it.

2554
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,732
Well, wait, the cops
and politicians,

2555
01:52:18,816 --> 01:52:20,234
of course they
did know about it.

2556
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:22,736
We just paid 'em to
not know about it.

2557
01:52:24,822 --> 01:52:25,823
Let's go. Come on.

2558
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,953
Vito got
to swank around

2559
01:52:31,036 --> 01:52:32,681
as the boss of bosses
for a couple of months

2560
01:52:32,705 --> 01:52:33,945
before the feds scooped him up.

2561
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:37,209
Vito got 16 years

2562
01:52:37,293 --> 01:52:39,753
for the importation and
distribution of narcotics.

2563
01:52:42,047 --> 01:52:45,551
With so much publicity, nobody
got away scot-free. Nobody.

2564
01:52:51,724 --> 01:52:54,935
Today, except for some dribs
and drabs, it's all over.

2565
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:57,396
Vito left Vincent in charge.

2566
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:00,399
But by then, the poor guy had
to walk around in a bathrobe

2567
01:53:00,483 --> 01:53:01,650
pretending to be nuts

2568
01:53:01,734 --> 01:53:03,861
just to get outta
there... the legal thing.

2569
01:53:03,944 --> 01:53:06,071
Because he was
gonna get indicted.

2570
01:53:06,155 --> 01:53:07,948
It was unbelievable.
The...

2571
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:10,451
That stupid bathrobe act
worked for about ten years

2572
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:12,953
until he finally got
picked up, then sent away.

2573
01:53:13,037 --> 01:53:15,206
And then he just died in prison.

2574
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:17,958
Even I ended up doing some time.

2575
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:19,877
Stuff to do with income tax.

2576
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,545
At one point I was
sent to Atlanta

2577
01:53:21,629 --> 01:53:23,923
where Vito was doing
his time for drugs.

2578
01:53:24,465 --> 01:53:26,592
Everybody knew what
had gone on between us.

2579
01:53:26,675 --> 01:53:28,886
And the warden didn't
want any wars breaking out

2580
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:30,721
while the two of us
were there, so...

2581
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:33,265
He was afraid some
hotheads might think

2582
01:53:33,349 --> 01:53:35,809
we were all still at war
and might make trouble.

2583
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:38,020
Well,
it was nothing.

2584
01:53:38,103 --> 01:53:40,022
We were even in Atlanta
prison together.

2585
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:42,983
Here we are, two old
guys sitting in a cell.

2586
01:53:43,526 --> 01:53:45,152
Just to keep the warden happy.

2587
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:47,071
Vito knew I brought it all down

2588
01:53:47,154 --> 01:53:50,032
by calling for the
meeting up in Apalachin.

2589
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:51,992
But by then, what's
the difference?

2590
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:53,744
It was all over.
What could one do?

2591
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:57,039
We talked about growing
up. About the old days.

2592
01:53:57,706 --> 01:53:58,791
It was nice.

2593
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:01,168
I'm glad we got to talk.

2594
01:54:04,088 --> 01:54:06,423
Vito died in 1969.

2595
01:54:07,383 --> 01:54:10,094
In Springfield, Missouri,
Federal Prison Hospital.

2596
01:54:10,177 --> 01:54:11,554
Congestive heart failure.

2597
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,722
And by the way,

2598
01:54:13,806 --> 01:54:16,892
when Anna died, she was
buried in Vito's mausoleum.

2599
01:54:17,434 --> 01:54:19,353
I guess Anna really
did love Vito.

2600
01:54:19,436 --> 01:54:22,481
Hard to believe, but
I guess it's true.

2601
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,651
And Bobbie...

2602
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:30,072
she got me one of these, uh...
This one. Slide projector.

2603
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:34,702
But mostly, I enjoy
hanging around the house.

2604
01:54:35,578 --> 01:54:37,955
I breed roses. They're nice.

2605
01:54:43,586 --> 01:54:46,171
They're cheaper than horses,
and they smell better.

2606
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:50,676
Next thing I know, Bobbie
enters me into a contest.

2607
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,137
And I won first prize.

2608
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:54,847
Or maybe she paid somebody off.

2609
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:55,931
What do I know?

2610
01:54:56,432 --> 01:54:57,516
Bobbie was right.

2611
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,602
Hey, I'm glad I
went. It was nice.

2612
01:54:59,685 --> 01:55:02,396
They were just flower people.
Didn't even know who I was.

2613
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:06,567
And even if they did,
they sort of didn't care.

2614
01:55:11,864 --> 01:55:12,865
Yeah.

2615
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:18,829
I mean, by the time we got here,

2616
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,498
they had already killed
most of the Indians,

2617
01:55:21,582 --> 01:55:24,126
dug up the gold,
sucked up all the oil.

2618
01:55:24,209 --> 01:55:27,212
And for us, all that was left

2619
01:55:27,296 --> 01:55:30,549
was thirsty Americans,
crooked cops and politicians.

2620
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:32,509
But we made the most of it.

2621
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:37,806
It's a different
time now. It's...

2622
01:55:39,808 --> 01:55:40,851
And the Alto Knights?

2623
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,186
Well, the Alto Knights...

2624
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:45,522
Life goes on.

2625
01:55:46,982 --> 01:55:47,983
That's it.

1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,632
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,134
<i>Thy kingdom come...</i>

3
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,222
<i>...thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

4
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,268
<i>Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>...and forgive us our trespasses...</i>

6
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,483
<i>...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

7
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,821
<i>Lead us not into temptation...</i>

8
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,657
<i>...but deliver us from evil.</i>

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,830
<i>For the kingdom, the power
and the glory are yours...</i>

10
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,374
<i>...now and forever.</i>

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>Amen.</i>

12
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,815
<i>Looking at mostly cloudy skies
and with lows in the upper 20s...</i>

13
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,526
<i>...there will be some refreeze
on some of the roads...</i>

14
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>...so slick spots are possible tonight
in isolated--</i>

15
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,826
You know the most important thing
your granddad ever taught me?

16
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,120
Hmm?

17
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,333
Be ready.

18
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,423
Hurricane, flood,
whatever it ends up being.

19
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:16,053
No more food gets delivered
to the grocery store, gas stations dry up.

20
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,889
People just turn on each other, and, uh...

21
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,061
All of a sudden, all that stands
between you and being dead is you.

22
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,568
I'm proud of you, son.

23
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,488
It was a nice shot.

24
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:52,881
<i>Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water</i>

25
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:59,805
<i>Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea</i>

26
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently</i>

27
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:20,826
<i>Every time I look into the holy book
I wanna tremble</i>

28
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,920
Hey, come on, hon.

29
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,967
Wait. I forgot something.
Hold on a second, Anna!

30
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,010
- Ralph, you have the venison?
- Yup.

31
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,804
I forgot the pie.

32
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,308
Are we taking the truck?

33
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,811
We're going up the street, you dope.

34
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,399
Come on.

35
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,445
Hey, wait for your mother, please.

36
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,655
Give me a ride.

37
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,993
Oh, you're getting heavy.

38
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,371
Danny's dad said he'd sell me their old car.

39
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,749
I got half of what I need saved
from the summer.

40
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,417
- I thought maybe--
- Forget it.

41
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,754
I can barely get enough carpentry work
to keep up with the mortgage.

42
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,299
Why don't you rent out Grandpa's
old apartment house?

43
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:23,096
Like I keep telling your mother, it's an old
building. It'll cost a fortune to fix it up.

44
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,520
Oh.

45
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,821
- Hey.
- Okay, okay.

46
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,615
They're here!

47
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,204
- Hello.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

48
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,872
Anna, wait until we're invited.

49
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,874
For God's sake, Keller.
Get the hell in here.

50
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,087
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Turkey Day.

51
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,965
- Keller, got the deer you shot?
- This one's Ralph's.

52
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,760
- You killed it, you take it into the kitchen.
- Thank you.

53
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,513
- I loved that last meal you gave us.
- There he is.

54
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,389
- Thank you. Happy T-Day.
- How are you?

55
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,600
- All right.
- Good to see you.

56
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,854
Joy, three times.
Joy, get those dolls off the table.

57
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,190
- Anna! Anna!
- Hi. How are you?

58
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,650
Happy Thanksgiving.

59
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,735
- Hi, Eliza.
- Anna, come here.

60
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,738
We wait until we're invited,
you understand?

61
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,074
You're in charge of this.

62
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,952
Us veterinarians make lousy butchers.

63
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,745
No problem.

64
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,833
Can I go outside with Joy?

65
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,211
Uh, convince your brother
to go with you and you can.

66
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,258
And wear a hat, please.
You're just getting over a cold.

67
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,385
Joy, you wear a hat too.

68
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,098
<i>Did you feel bad for that deer when you shot it?</i>

69
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,018
Do you feel bad for cows
when you go to McDonald's?

70
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,897
That's what my dad says.
Deer, if they have too many babies...

71
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,150
...the babies starve anyway.
You gotta keep the population down.

72
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,777
Right.

73
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,572
- Your dad say that too?
- Pull harder.

74
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,575
Hey! Get away from that thing!

75
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,201
Let me see that.

76
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,453
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

77
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,705
I said, let's go!

78
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,541
Stop. Stop. You can't just hit
somebody's stuff like that.

79
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,169
- No! Let's go! Come on, come on.
- Let me--!

80
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,131
Wait. You hear that?

81
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,967
Somebody's in there.

82
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,762
I don't feel like getting yelled at. Let's go.
Don't climb up, okay?

83
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,230
<i>And it causes me shame to know
We're not the people we should be</i>

84
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,569
The school board's telling me
there's no money for new band uniforms.

85
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,655
Kids are wearing the same uniforms
they had when we went there.

86
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,658
They were old then.
I mean, marching right out of 1979.

87
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,870
Why isn't he speaking to me?

88
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,872
He doesn't speak.

89
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,833
- Cutie pie.
- Mm-hm.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,627
- Oh, my gosh!
- Whoa.

91
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,962
- He's fast too.
- Mm.

92
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,632
He's so quick. Is that a slide?

93
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,593
Thank y'all. Thank y'all. Got a surprise.

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,595
Oh.

95
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,015
And I am taking requests.

96
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,767
- Yes! Yes.
- No.

97
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay.

98
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,106
You gotta listen out for it
because this is not easy.

99
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,442
Mommy, can I take Joy to our house?

100
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,402
- Why?
- My red whistle.

101
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,196
She's gonna help me look for it.

102
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,074
Sweetheart, I think that red whistle
is long gone.

103
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,367
What whistle?

104
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,787
The emergency whistle Daddy gave me.
I lost it...

105
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,541
...a hundred and 33 days ago.

106
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,380
Well, if you want to find a whistle,
you have to whistle for it.

107
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,674
So we'll do "Jingle Bells" to find it.

108
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,807
<i>Jingle Bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

109
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,559
<i>The Batmobile lost its wheel
And Joker got away</i>

110
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,144
- Okay.
- Yay!

111
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,231
Okay! Okay. You can go. All right.

112
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,442
Just make sure Eliza
and Ralph go with you, please.

113
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,320
- No looking in the basement.
- I won't.

114
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,573
Your eardrums are starting to grow.
Don't want to damage them yet.

115
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,201
- But I am taking requests from you, Keller.
- From me?

116
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,413
- Your day, your request.
- Oh. Uh, the piano.

117
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,249
- No. So all set?
- No, no, no.

118
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,502
Wait, listen. He used to love--
He used to dress like Springsteen.

119
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,921
- I still love Springsteen.
- "Jersey Girl."

120
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:30,885
Well, I ain't white, and I like him too much,
and I'm too drunk to cover The Boss.

121
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,429
- Thank you.
- Honey?

122
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,015
- What else?
- Nothing comes to mind. Nothing.

123
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,017
- Oh, I know.
- What?

124
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,271
He actually loves "The Star-Spangled Banner."
I know. Sings it in the shower.

125
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,440
- I do not.
- Yes, you do!

126
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,774
I got you.

127
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,143
Where are your sisters?

128
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,312
I can't find them.

129
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,190
You, uh, go to the house with them?

130
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,150
No. What are you talking about?

131
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,652
- Earlier?
- No.

132
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,531
What? They were supposed to come down
earlier and get you. They didn't come?

133
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,492
No. We haven't seen them since we ate.

134
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,328
It's all right. They're probably at our house.

135
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,343
Anna?

136
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,303
Joy?

137
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,681
Anna?

138
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,434
Girls?

139
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,163
Girls?

140
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,874
- Who put these in here?
- Get out of here.

141
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,628
- They weren't outside. It's starting to rain.
- Did you check by Maria's swing?

142
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,213
Yeah.

143
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,008
They're getting whupped when
they get here. Sorry, Grace. I whup kids.

144
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,844
What? So they weren't there either?

145
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,887
- They must be at home.
- Are they here?

146
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,723
- They weren't there?
- No, they're not at the house.

147
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,933
They're not there.

148
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,686
I checked the entire house. They're not here.

149
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,439
The RV.

150
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,234
Dad, there was this RV
and they were playing on it.

151
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,820
There was--
We thought there was someone inside.

152
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,196
- Wait, nobody--
- Where?

153
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,073
Where was it? Show me.

154
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,159
- You wait here.
- Let me go!

155
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,661
- I'm gonna search the house again.
- Relax. Relax.

156
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,374
Go that way. I'll meet you on the other side.

157
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,751
Anna?

158
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,461
Joy!

159
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:18,178
- Roger, you seen my daughter walk by here?
- No. Is there a problem?

160
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,974
Anna?

161
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,436
Here! Dad, it was parked right here.

162
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,649
Anna? Anna?

163
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,278
- Hello, hello!
- Did you see them?

164
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,614
- No!
- Hello!

165
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,826
- I couldn't find them!
- Were you messing around in this house?

166
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,536
- No.
- Told you not to come here.

167
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,788
They were on the RV
and we got them off of it.

168
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,291
Tell me everything you remember
about that RV.

169
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,794
- A ladder on the back.
- Police, police.

170
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,892
Happy Thanksgiving.

171
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,396
Thanks. Hey, you have any of those
fortune cookie things?

172
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,483
My boss told me cops
don't like fortune cookies.

173
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,321
What year were you born?
Are you a dragon or a snake or a horse, or--?

174
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,989
I'm a monkey.

175
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,783
Oh, you're a monkey.

176
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:28,665
You're very intelligent.
You have an ability to influence people.

177
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,126
Think you could influence your boss
to lower the check a little bit?

178
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:37,131
No. I cannot. My boss is a rooster.

179
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,723
So he's selfish and eccentric, that's...

180
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,733
<i>All units, all units.
An RV was reported matching the description.</i>

<i>10-80 responding.</i>

185

This is 13-40. I'm five minutes out.
I'll meet the responding units.

<i>- 10-80 standing by.</i>

13-40. I am on-scene.
Be advised, we are moving in.

Hey.

Hey, I see you in there.
Show me both your hands right now.

Hey! I see you in there.

Both hands right now!

203
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:43,526
Nice and slow. Slow. Slow! Slow.
Slowly. Both hands.

204
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,028
Both fucking hands!

205
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,825
Walk! Walk!

206
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,789
Walk! Get up! Get up!

Get up!

Show me those girls!
Show me where you put those girls.

209
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,384
Where are those girls?
Where are those girls?

210
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,136
- Give me the flashlight.
- Sir.

211
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,638
Show me where those girls--
They in the woods?

212
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,932
You put them in the woods?

213
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,352
Where did you put those girls?

214
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,898
You hear me?

215
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,067
What the fuck is this guy on?

216
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,403
No, he's high on something.

217
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,989
Put this fucking guy in the car.
Get him in the car.

218
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,783
- Put him in the fucking car! Walk!
- Let's go.

219
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,579
Hey, call P.S.P.,
tell them to send their scent dogs.

220
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,041
And seal <i>off</i> the whole area.
The entrance, all of it.

221
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,127
- Right.
- You, come with me.

222
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,005
No, they weren't playing on your RV?

223
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,590
No.

224
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,556
Okay, take a look at them again.

225
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,895
- Don't recognize these girls?
- I didn't see them. May I sit down?

226
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,271
<i>What do you do in the RV?</i>

227
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,940
- <i>Answer my questions.</i>
<i>- Sleep there.</i>

228
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,818
<i>You sleep in there?
You were sleeping out there? In the day?</i>

229
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,072
Why was the RV
parked outside the house?

230
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,032
Hmm...

231
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,535
I went for a drive?

232
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,829
You went for a drive?
You weren't driving.

233
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,915
<i>I know girls were playing
outside your RV.</i>

234
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,085
You weren't driving. It was parked.
Was it a special day?

235
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,587
- Were you planning on taking two little girls?
- No.

236
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,257
- Have you done that before?
- No.

237
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,301
<i>- Did you ask them to come inside?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

238
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,636
<i>You ask them to come in...</i>

239
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,596
- <i>...and then you take them away?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

240
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,723
- You put those girls somewhere?
- May I sit?

241
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,392
- Come on.
- Please don't touch me.

242
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,686
I know you put those girls somewhere.

243
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,063
- You hide them?
- No.

244
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,691
How did you hide them.
Did you tie them up?

245
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,442
- Did you tie them up?
- Hmm.

246
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,861
Huh? Hey. Hey.

247
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,697
Hey.

248
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,743
Look, I know you're a good guy.
I know you're a decent guy.

249
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,996
<i>I'm not telling you
you're doing anything bad.</i>

250
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,666
<i>I'm just trying to get the right answers.
The real ones. That's all I want.</i>

251
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,419
Where do you usually park your RV, Alex?

252
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,712
My aunt's house.

253
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,921
<i>Your aunt's house?</i>

254
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,881
<i>She lets me park it in the back yard.</i>

255
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,635
<i>Grass don't grow back there anyway.</i>

256
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,347
It was my husband's.

257
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,891
For sale, if you want it.

258
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,522
No, thanks.

259
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,693
Would you tell me
what you're doing on my property then?

260
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,198
I'm just glad to know where he is.

261
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,369
He's always home before dark, and...

262
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,871
...I just don't understand.

263
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,541
That boy has never been in trouble,
not a day in his life.

264
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,173
In the summertime,
he sleeps out in the camper some, but...

265
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,302
...this time of year he sleeps
in here on the sofa bed.

266
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,229
That's my husband.

267
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,400
We had a fight, jeez, five years ago.

268
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,113
Walked out, didn't come back.

269
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,368
Alex loved him like a father.

270
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,581
Where are Alex's real parents?

271
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,875
My husband's brother and his girlfriend...

272
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:32,171
...they died in a car accident
when Alex was about 6.

273
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,090
Sorry to hear that.

274
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,102
He doesn't have much.

275
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,276
What have you got?

276
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,656
Well, this thing's clean. I mean, it's filthy
as shit, but we didn't find anything.

277
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,659
You didn't find any wool fibers,
anything like that?

278
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,622
The girls could be wearing some wool
gloves or wool hat, no cotton fibers?

279
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,458
If he was using this to transport them,
I might buy that.

280
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,670
But if there had been a struggle,
I would have found something.

281
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,631
I'd start looking in the woods
by the rest stop.

282
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,927
Yeah, half the uniformed cops
in the state are doing that right now.

283
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,181
When you're done with this thing, can you
send a crew over to the aunt's house?

284
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,997
Anna?

285
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,880
Anna?

286
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,037
Thanks for coming. Franklin Birch.

287
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,289
My wife's in here.

288
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,627
Honey? Her name's Nancy.

289
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,546
Detective Loki is-- Honey?

290
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,223
These photos are better
than the ones my husband gave you.

291
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,934
You can see her eyes more clearly.

292
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,088
So did we pass?

293
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,591
I'm sorry, what did you say?

294
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,470
The poly thing, the lie detector
we took this morning.

295
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,472
Did we pass?

296
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,850
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

297
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,312
Yes. We appreciate your cooperation.

298
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,442
It's embarrassing, all the-- All this fuss.

299
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,445
Everyone's gonna think we're crazy...

300
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,657
...when those two come out of hiding,
wherever they are.

301
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,828
Do you have some reason
to believe they ran away?

302
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,496
No.

303
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,125
They're happy.

304
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,006
They must have run away.

305
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,343
I think they must have run away. Right?

306
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,763
Um...

307
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,977
Your police captain told me
that you've solved every case...

308
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,063
...that you've ever been assigned.
Is that right?

309
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,655
Sorry.

310
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:33,954
I am so sorry.
Do you have children, detective?

311
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,671
I'm gonna find your daughter.

312
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,427
We believe they came back here
after they left you at the Birches' yesterday.

313
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,180
They were looking for Anna's red whistle.

314
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,140
Right.

315
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,684
I read your statement.

316
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,395
I'm Detective Loki.

317
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:02,066
I'm heading up the investigation
into your daughter's disappearance.

318
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,526
Please sit down.

319
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,992
My son already told you that the guy
was inside the RV just watching them, right?

320
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,871
We haven't found
any physical evidence inside the RV.

321
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,540
Or his aunt's house where he lives.

322
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,251
- Nothing?
- Alex Jones...

323
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,380
...unfortunately has the I.Q.
of a 10-year-old.

324
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,174
There's no way someone
with the I.Q. of a 10-year-old...

325
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,885
...could abduct two girls
in broad daylight, and then...

326
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,971
...somehow make them disappear.

327
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,683
Well, how can he drive an RV?

328
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,519
If he can't answer a question...

329
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,355
Well, he has a legal Pennsylvania license.

330
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,233
And he ran, right?
They said he tried to run away.

331
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,237
Why--? Why? Why would he run?

332
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:52,783
I've just spent 10 hours questioning this boy.
Okay? I hear what you're saying.

333
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,576
Uh...

334
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,498
Did you give him a lie detector?
You gave us a lie-- Did you give him one?

335
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,959
I understand what you're asking me.
Yes, we did.

336
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,503
We gave him a lie detector,
and there's no way of...

337
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:10,050
A lie detector doesn't work
if you don't understand the questions.

338
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,470
Well, maybe he wasn't on his own.
How could he drive an RV...

339
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,224
- ...if he has an I.Q. of a 10-year-old?
- We're considering all possibilities.

340
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,310
- I don't think you are considering--
- I hear what you're saying.

341
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,105
Listen to me. Shut the fuck up
for a fucking second!

342
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,610
This is what I'm gonna need you to do
for me. I need you to calm down.

343
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,283
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please listen to me for a second.

344
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,036
Mr. Dover, I understand
this is an incredibly hard time.

345
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:41,373
But I have every uniformed police officer
in this state looking for Anna.

346
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,626
I don't understand what any of this means.
They said he ran.

347
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:49,923
They said he tried to get away. I don't
understand why he would try to run away.

348
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,553
We're considering all possibilities,
Mr. Dover.

349
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,305
I hear what you're saying.

350
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,267
I'm not crossing anybody off my list.
Just...

351
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,853
...let me do my job.

352
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,326
Hey!

353
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,328
Detective!

354
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,331
- Shit.
- Hey!

355
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,959
He stays in custody
until my daughter's found, right?

356
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,169
Right?

357
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,214
We have a 48 hour hold on him
unless we bring charges.

358
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,509
Well, charge him with something.
Charge him.

359
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,971
- Mr. Dover, I understand what you're--
- Two girls have got to be worth...

360
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,016
...whatever rule you break
to keep that asshole in custody.

361
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,602
I know you can't promise me anything.
I understand.

362
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,731
But I'm asking you to be sure.
Be 100 percent sure.

363
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,900
Thank you.

364
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,986
I appreciate it.

365
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,575
So you're positive he's innocent,
but you want to hold him?

366
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,536
Anna's father was a mess this morning.

367
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,206
- I understand. But it's not gonna happen.
- I was asking for one more day.

368
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,625
Fuck you. Oh, no.

369
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,462
Find his daughter, he'll forgive you.
You don't, he's gonna hate you anyway.

370
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,297
So, what's next?

371
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,593
- I'm knocking on doors all night.
- You're coming up on 24 hours missing...

372
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,222
- ...and you have exactly shit.
- I've got nine level-three sex offenders...

373
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,851
...living within a 10-mile radius
of Fairmont Circle. So if you don't mind.

374
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,060
- Then go.
- Yeah.

375
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,520
Go.

376
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,158
It's right here.

377
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,251
Look, I'm staying straight, okay?

378
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,963
No, it's-- Hey, look. Look, I know you're--

379
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,800
- I was--
- Like yourself some German porn, huh?

380
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,594
Look, I was--

381
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,758
Father! Open up! It's the police!

382
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,672
Father.

383
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,470
Father.

384
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,019
Mind if I take a look around?

385
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,714
Fucking drunk.

386
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,899
What the fuck?

387
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,072
Whoa.

388
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,706
Fuck.

389
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,444
Aah. Fuck.

390
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,016
Aah! Please, God, God!

391
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,894
What's the name of your buddy down
there? What's the name?

392
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,355
- I don't know his name.
- Huh? You don't know his name?

393
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,315
- I don't know his name.
- You know what?

394
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:26,862
I spent six years in Huntington Boys' Home.
You know the Huntington Boys' Home, right?

395
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,365
Hurting a fuck like you'd be a treat.
Why don't you tell me his name?

396
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:35,162
He didn't tell me his name.
He came to me for a confession.

397
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,207
He said he'd killed 16 children.
He bragged about it.

398
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,462
I convinced him to come back here.
He said he'd kill more.

399
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,797
Sixteen children, huh?

400
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,384
- All right, let's go, you fucking chicken-hawk.
- Aah!

401
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,419
- Hey.
<i>- They're letting him go.</i>

402
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,213
- What?
<i>- The man.</i>

403
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,423
<i>The police
said they're letting him go today.</i>

404
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,885
Oh, okay. I'll take care of it.

405
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,429
- Dad?
- Keep searching.

406
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,765
Where are you going?

407
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,608
They want you to write your whole name.

408
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,491
That's good.

409
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,792
Mm-hm. Good job.
Now you give it to the man.

410
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:17,222
All right. Come on. I don't want
you minding these people out here.

411
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,977
Don't talk to them.
You've got nothing to say to them.

412
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,020
- Hey!
- Alex!

413
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,648
Back, back.

414
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,441
Let them walk.

415
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,827
- Alex!
- Come on, Alex.

416
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,328
You took those kids, didn't you?

417
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,123
I just want to talk.
He's a free man, I'm a free man!

418
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,001
- No!
- Hey!

419
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,753
Tell me what you did with them!
Tell me!

420
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,589
They didn't cry until I left them.

421
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,133
What did you say? What did you say?

422
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,635
No, no! No!

423
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,679
Fucking get off him!

424
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,264
God. Get up!

425
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,641
Get him down! Get him down!

426
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,810
- Move back! Move back!
- Come on.

427
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:08,690
Please, just let us go. Thanks for nothing.
We're fine. Thank you.

428
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,617
Now, I know your dad was a guard
at Graterford.

429
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,952
And I've got a daughter of my own, so...

430
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,205
...we're gonna pretend this never happened.

431
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,543
And as for Alex Jones, he has orders
not to leave the commonwealth.

432
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,881
- What?
- Sir, I need you to go home. All right?

433
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,675
- I need you to go home.
- What about what I just told you?

434
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,385
Why aren't you sending someone
to arrest this guy?

435
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:41,181
Tell Detective Loki what you just told me,
and he'll definitely look into it.

436
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,724
Go ahead.

437
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:48,146
That asshole you promised me you'd
keep in custody, right? And you didn't.

438
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,232
When I grabbed him in the parking lot,
he said right to my face:

439
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,736
"They didn't cry until I left them."
Right to my fucking face.

440
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,780
He said that to you in the parking lot?

441
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,658
Right now, yeah. What did I just say?
In the parking lot.

442
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,077
Before you grabbed me off him.

443
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,664
Did anyone else hear it besides you?

444
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,168
I don't know. It was quiet. He said it to me.
He wanted me to know.

445
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,170
- Are you sure he said that?
- What?

446
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,881
Are you sure that's what he said?

447
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,677
Jesus Christ, you think I'm making this up?
Why would I make this up?

448
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,261
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No. No.

449
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,306
- Think about it. Why would I make this up?
- I'm not saying that.

450
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,351
I'm just asking you a couple questions.
I will talk to him.

451
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,397
- No, don't talk to him! Arrest him!
- Mr. Dover.

452
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,276
What did I fucking tell you?

453
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,071
What did I tell you? One more day.

454
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:43,368
You sure you didn't say anything
to Mr. Dover in the parking lot today?

455
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,039
Anything he could have misinterpreted or...?

456
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,125
I was right there.

457
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,920
They didn't say anything to each other.
Man just attacked the boy.

458
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:59,217
Nothing like "get away from me"
or "help" or...

459
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,302
...anything like that?

460
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,139
No.

461
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,144
Can I speak to Alex alone for a minute?

462
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,735
It's all right, sweetie.
I'll be right in the next room.

463
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,332
You love your aunt, don't you, Alex?

464
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,631
Yes.

465
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,344
If you know something you're not telling us,
she could go to jail for a very long time.

466
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,055
Do you want that for her?

467
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,684
After everything she's done for you?

468
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,312
No.

469
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,205
Mr. Dover, it's Detective Loki.

470
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,708
- Have you arrested him?
<i>- Look, I just came from Alex Jones.</i>

471
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,127
<i>He said he didn't say anything
to you in the lot.</i>

472
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,173
I pushed him pretty hard, he didn't budge.
We can't waste any more time on this guy.

473
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,177
You're gonna have to trust me.
I'll let you know if I have anything new--

474
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,637
For the--

475
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,015
Fucking A.

476
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,241
The zipper on her coat was broken,
and I told her it didn't matter...

477
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,910
...because we were just gonna go
right down the street.

478
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,163
- No. No.
- Why hasn't she come home?

479
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,582
It's been three days.

480
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,294
Why can't you make her come home?

481
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,673
I don't understand.

482
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:06,553
I don't understand. It's been too long.

483
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,764
Please make her come home.

484
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,560
- Please.
- How many of these...?

485
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,145
How many of these?
How many of these? How many?

486
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,232
- I don't know!
- Shh. Okay, that's all right.

487
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,192
Just take one.

488
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,611
Here.

489
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,864
No.

490
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:31,536
I just want to sleep.
I just want to go to sleep.

491
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,622
You...

492
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,961
You made me feel so safe.

493
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:48,636
You told us that you could protect us
from everything.

494
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,639
Oh, God.

495
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,147
I'm gonna go out and help the police.
Just keep an eye on your mother.

496
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,151
Your sister needs us to be brave for her.

497
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,363
Be brave for her. Be a grown-up for me,
okay? Can you do that?

498
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:12,744
Can you do that? I know you're scared.
Look at me. Come here.

499
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,829
I know you're scared.

500
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,415
It's gonna be okay.

501
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,184
<i>The former
is a reason why we should be very patient...</i>

502
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,939
<i>...the latter why we should be very penitent
when we are afflicted.</i>

503
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,693
<i>He reminds him that trouble and affliction
are what we have all reason...</i>

504
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,948
<i>...to expect in this world.
Man is brought into trouble...</i>

505
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,661
<i>...not as man, but as sinful man,
who was in transgression.</i>

506
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,956
<i>Man born in sin
and therefore born to trouble.</i>

507
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,149
Come on. Come on, Tucker.

508
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,319
<i>Jingle bells, Batman smells</i>

509
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,946
<i>Robin laid an egg</i>

510
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,949
<i>The Batmobile lost its wheels</i>

511
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,286
<i>Joker got away, hey</i>

512
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:04,791
<i>Jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

513
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,886
<i>Jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

514
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,596
Alex.

515
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,100
<i>Lost its wheel</i>

516
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,356
That song.
Where did you hear those words?

517
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,693
Hmm?

518
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,051
Did you bring a change of clothes
like I told you?

519
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,347
Yeah. You gonna tell me why?

520
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,183
It's better if I just show you.

521
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,229
Show me what?

522
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,170
- Didn't you used to live here?
- Mm-hm.

523
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,850
Close the door. Lock it.

524
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,746
Wow.

525
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,809
Oh, my God. What did you do?

526
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,480
- Keller, what the hell?
- I heard him singing the song...

527
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,858
...they were singing. Swear to God, Franklin.
The same fucking song.

528
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:40,071
- And I told you what he said in the parking lot.
- Then we take him to the police.

529
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:44,325
No. The police won't do shit. He'll just
clam up and act crazy like last time.

530
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,787
Someone has to make him talk. Someone.

531
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,504
Shit, man. This ain't right.
What if you're wrong?

532
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,006
- I'm not wrong.
- But what if you're wrong?

533
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,300
What if you only heard
what you wanted to hear?

534
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,178
What if--?
Man, I want my daughter back...

535
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:07,640
- ...as much as you do, but it ain't right.
- Franklin, Franklin!

536
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,687
We hurt him until he talks,
or they're gonna die.

537
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,733
- This ain't--
- No. No.

538
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,487
We hurt him until he talks
or they're gonna die.

539
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,448
That's the choice.

540
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,202
That's the choice you have to make.

541
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,538
I've made my choice.

542
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,373
I know what I heard.

543
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:40,131
He's not a person anymore.

544
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,843
No, he stopped being a person
when he took our daughters.

545
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,813
I need your help.

546
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,734
This is your last chance.

547
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,237
I know you're scared.
I know you wanna go home.

548
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,115
All right? I know.
I don't want to hurt you. I don't.

549
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:10,286
I'm gonna take the tape off,
and I want you to tell me where they are.

550
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,832
Hey. Come on.

551
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,088
Did you see my glasses?

552
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,590
What?

553
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,091
I can't see.

554
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,094
If you're not gonna talk, Alex,
I'm gonna have to hurt you.

555
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,056
Tell me where they are.

556
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,308
Where are they?

557
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,436
Tell me where they are!

558
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,022
I'm out here at a house on Fairmont Circle.

559
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:42,151
That house the RV was parked in front of.
It's been on the market a couple months.

560
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,779
I'm gonna track the owners,
see if they know anything.

561
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,032
Got any new info on that corpse
we found in the priest's basement?

562
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,160
<i>No DNA, dental, or fingerprint matches.</i>

563
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,370
Nothing.

564
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,289
<i>Priest is sticking to the story too.</i>

565
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,125
All right.

566
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:32,493
Same person who took him,
took those girls. I'm sure of it.

567
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,208
Wearing out the tape, I guess.

568
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,004
I watch it every day after breakfast.
It's the only video I have of him.

569
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,093
It was before your time.

570
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,556
Twenty-six years ago, August 19th.

571
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,519
I took a nap in the afternoon,
and when I woke up, Barry was gone.

572
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,605
No one could ever tell me
what happened to him.

573
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,484
He was playing in the front yard...

574
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,530
...just a few feet from where
they say that RV was parked.

575
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,950
What do you think that means?

576
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,207
I'm more interested
in what you think that means.

577
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,004
I don't think we'll ever know.

578
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,215
It's just like Barry.

579
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,471
No one took them. Nothing happened.

580
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,599
They're just gone.

581
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,226
- He's gonna say to you.
- Yeah, right.

582
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,028
How you doing, Father?

583
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,867
I'm getting better.

584
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,537
So Detective Chemelinski tells me
that you have some specifics...

585
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,207
...about the crime
you claim that guy committed.

586
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,542
The abductor.

587
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,628
He was...

588
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,341
...waging a war against God.

589
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,722
Great. That's great.

590
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,060
I thought you said
he had something specific. I'm not--

591
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,271
Tell him how he took the kids.

592
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,068
He said...

593
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,864
...he took them in daylight.

594
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,784
Sometimes...

595
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,121
...more than one child at a time.

596
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,542
- He said that?
- Yes.

597
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:49,588
Did he say he was with anybody?
He did it alone?

598
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,007
He...

599
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,636
He said he had a family.

600
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,602
That's it?

601
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,526
All right.

602
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,028
Informative.

603
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,833
You said they cried when you left them.

604
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,001
Look at me.

605
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,295
You said they cried when you left them!

606
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:33,173
You said they cried when you left them!

607
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,009
Now tell me!

608
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,638
Where is she? Hmm?

609
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,682
Tell me where they are!

610
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,898
Just tell me. Just tell me and I'll stop.

611
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,026
I'll stop as soon as you tell me.

612
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,824
Just...

613
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,869
Just tell me where they are.

614
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,838
Why won't you tell me?

615
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,256
Huh?

616
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,888
Why won't you just fucking tell us?

617
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,572
He knows. He knows.

618
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,494
I can see it in his eyes.
He fucking knows.

619
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,833
I know you know!
Why aren't you fucking telling me?

620
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,087
Why?

621
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,385
Fine.

622
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,932
- Get him up. Get him up.
- Oh, God.

623
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:09,269
Get up. Get up. Get up!

624
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,237
You gonna make me use this?

625
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:22,950
You gonna tell us?
If you don't, I'm gonna use this.

626
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,453
Fine.

627
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,292
You're doing this to yourself.

628
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,838
Just tell us. Tell me.

629
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,341
Tell me!

630
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,720
Tell me!

631
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,597
Tell me! Tell me!

632
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,767
Where's my daughter?

633
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,854
Where's my daughter?

634
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,004
<i>Four days
have passed since Anna Dover and Joy Birch...</i>

635
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,589
<i>...were last seen by their families.</i>

636
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,300
<i>The two girls, aged 6 and 7,
are believed to have been...</i>

637
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:25,179
<i>...playing on this street when they
disappeared without a trace.</i>

638
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,181
<i>As you can see, despite the cold...</i>

639
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,017
<i>...a lot of people have turned out
to show their support.</i>

640
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,353
<i>Police are asking that anyone
with any information...</i>

641
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,701
Where have you been?

642
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,789
I was searching for her in the woods.

643
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,266
I'm okay.

644
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,018
God.

645
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,438
Franklin, what is it?

646
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,817
I just need a minute.

647
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,229
What the fuck? Get off of me!

648
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,651
Hey! Hey!

649
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,673
Okay.

650
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,485
<i>And this is who police are saying
is a person of interest...</i>

651
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:35,489
<i>...in the investigation of the two
missing girls. This unidentified man...</i>

652
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:39,242
<i>...who was last seen at last night's
candlelight vigil, fled on foot...</i>

653
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,163
<i>...when the investigating detective
attempted to question him.</i>

654
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,457
<i>Police caution the public
not to approach this man...</i>

655
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,751
<i>...but to call police immediately
if they do see him.</i>

656
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,880
<i>Thanks, John, for that update.
And now for the weather.</i>

657
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,133
<i>We should expect heavy rain
into the early evening and--</i>

658
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,396
Look, Keller, I mean, just think about it.

659
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:12,067
Why would the police be looking
for this man if they didn't think he did it?

660
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,402
They did it together. They know each other.

661
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,365
I fucking told you.
Jones looked me in the eye and he said:

662
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,450
"They only cried when I left them."

663
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,703
He left them with someone,
and he knows where this guy is.

664
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:32,337
Holly Jones' dog got hit
on Southward Street.

665
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:35,549
Alex took the dog for a walk
night before last. Never came home.

666
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,510
His aunt didn't want to tell us
when we called her about it.

667
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:41,054
She said it would get him
into trouble or some shit.

668
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:44,724
- You said you'd keep him under surveillance.
- You said the guy was innocent.

669
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,519
I thought the guy from last night
you said was our guy.

670
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,564
I don't have money in the budget
for watching innocent people.

671
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,567
- You said you'd put him under surveillance.
- What do you want?

672
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,820
Keep your word. Give me a call,
I would have been there all night.

673
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,405
I would know where he was now.

674
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,242
- I need to know where everybody is.
- All right, point made. Point made.

675
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:05,704
If you be clear, then I'll be clear.
I need to know where everybody is.

676
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:08,039
If you do something different,
please tell me.

677
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,335
<i>Tell me about your RV.</i>

678
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,254
<i>What do you do in your RV?</i>

679
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,590
<i>It's where I go...</i>

680
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,467
<i>...to be alone.</i>

681
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,891
<i>What music do you listen to in your RV...</i>

682
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,642
<i>...when you're alone?</i>

683
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,606
<i>Radio, tape.</i>

684
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,446
<i>The RV was parked over on Fairmont Circle?</i>

685
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,824
<i>No. Is my aunt coming?</i>

686
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,701
<i>I-- I-- I...</i>

687
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,875
<i>Have you seen these girls?</i>

688
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,628
- <i>No.</i>
<i>- You take a look at them.</i>

689
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,129
<i>You seen these girls?</i>

690
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,467
<i>No.</i>

691
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:04,095
<i>Did you participate in any way
in the abduction of those girls?</i>

692
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:06,973
<i>No.</i>

693
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,684
Loki! You got a call.

694
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,606
All right.

695
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,361
I called as soon as I saw the sketch on TV.

696
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,947
He comes in here every week
and buys kids' clothes.

697
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,699
But he's always buying stuff
in different sizes.

698
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,786
Caught him messing around
with the mannequins once.

699
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,580
- What did he pay with?
- Cash.

700
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,542
All right, give me a call
if you hear anything.

701
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,169
Okay.

702
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,509
It's been five days.

703
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,513
Maybe five days
since they had a drink of water.

704
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:50,183
This could be the last night that matters.

705
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:56,564
Look, I'll call you
after Nancy goes to sleep, all right?

706
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,359
Promise.

707
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,810
Where have you been all this time?

708
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,344
What the hell were you thinking?

709
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,689
You tell anyone?

710
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,858
Did you?

711
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,573
I wanna see him.

712
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,561
Shh.

713
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,098
Please help me.

714
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,813
Could you help me find my little girl?

715
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,609
Got a picture.

716
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,236
See?

717
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,449
This my baby.

718
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,535
You see her?

719
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,288
Her name is Joy.

720
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,379
And, um...

721
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:11,009
This is a stuffed animal
we got her when she was 2...

722
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:14,012
...because she's afraid
to sleep by herself. Please...

723
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:19,142
...tell me where my little girl is.
Please tell me where my little girl is.

724
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:29,736
I know you're gonna tell me.
I know you're gonna tell me.

725
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,154
I know.

726
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,739
Shh, shh.

727
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,091
Help me.

728
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:55,887
Help me.

729
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,847
Franklin, can you close the door to the--?

730
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,392
Nancy!

731
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:04,395
- What the fuck you doing?
- Aah!

732
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,276
- Goddamn it! Damn!
- Aah!

733
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:14,155
Let it go. Let it go!

734
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,538
You untied him? Huh?

735
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,760
That was close.

736
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:21,556
- What is it? What happened?
- Get Franklin. I need to show you something.

737
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,728
Did he say anything new?

738
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,314
He will soon. You'll see.

739
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,534
No light gets in.

740
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,705
There's barely enough room
to sit down inside.

741
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:48,666
Shower still works,
but we control from out here.

742
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:54,714
And I rigged the water heater
so it either comes out scalding or freezing.

743
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,802
And, uh, you talk to him through this.

744
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,679
It's to remind us...

745
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,224
...in case we start feeling sorry for him.

746
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,728
My God.

747
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:13,024
I can't hurt him any more without
killing him, so this is the only way.

748
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,985
Have you lost your mind, Keller?

749
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,738
Do you have a better idea, Franklin?

750
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,240
Do you?

751
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:26,245
Go ahead. Let him out, if you want.
I'm not gonna stop you.

752
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,749
If that's what you really want,
you go ahead.

753
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:34,420
You think someone's looking out for our
girls the way you're looking out for him?

754
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,048
I hope.

755
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:42,387
It's been five days now, man.
We're running out of time.

756
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,765
- You don't even know it's him.
- Yeah, I do.

757
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:49,644
- No, you don't. I know you. You don't.
- I do.

758
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,482
Look, I want my baby back...

759
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,986
...as much as you miss Anna.

760
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,948
And despite what you think about me...

761
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,283
...I would die for my daughter.

762
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,662
But this ain't right.

763
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,956
This has to stop.

764
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,585
Well, then you better get to work.

765
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,799
I'd start with that wall there.

766
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,527
Franklin.

767
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,530
Stop.

768
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,832
Franklin, think of Joy.

769
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,875
I need to get out of this place, Ralph.

770
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:40,421
Everything in this house
just makes me want to throw up.

771
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,759
Your dad's building?

772
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,763
There is no way
I'm staying in that crack house.

773
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,890
It's disgusting.

774
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,061
Yeah, okay.

775
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,504
We're not gonna help Keller,
but we won't stop him either.

776
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,048
Let him do what he needs to.

777
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,765
We don't know about it anymore.

778
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,125
Eliza?

779
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,879
Eliza?

780
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,720
Eliza?

781
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,640
Eliza, open the door!

782
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,227
- Eliza?
- Is she in there?

783
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,146
Honey?

784
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,356
- Eliza.
- Get out of the way! Hey--

785
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,651
Fuck you both. Next time you plan
on leaving me here alone...

786
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,696
...maybe you could try at least
telling me where you're going.

787
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,220
Ralph?

788
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,559
Anna?

789
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,812
Anna?

790
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,274
Anna.

791
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,739
Anna?

792
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,251
Anna?

793
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,672
Mom?

794
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,679
- Mom? What are you doing?
- Anna was here.

795
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:20,599
It's freezing in here. Mom. Hey, Mom!
Sit down. Stop. Calm down.

796
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,144
I'm gonna close the window.

797
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,815
And she wasn't here.

798
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:33,029
And then I heard a sound
from my room, and I--

799
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,407
I came in and the window was open. And...

800
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,909
And it wasn't open before.

801
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:43,914
And then-- And then Ralph,
he came in...

802
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,584
...and he looked and, um...

803
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,378
And then...

804
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,131
Then I don't know.

805
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,969
Aren't you gonna write this down?

806
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,985
The basement. I didn't check the basement.
We need to check the basement.

807
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:15,488
I'll show you. I'll show you.

808
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,794
The kids know
they're not allowed down here.

809
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,677
They're not supposed to come down here,
but I don't know.

810
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:59,115
My husband likes to be prepared
for emergencies.

811
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,498
Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?

812
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,837
I was gonna ask you. He's been out
searching with the police for Anna.

813
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,464
Which you should be doing right now.

814
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,717
Does he always stay out this late?

815
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:22,847
Yes, he stays out this late
when he's looking for my daughter...

816
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,141
...since my daughter has been gone. Yes!

817
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,892
Shit.

818
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,981
Hey, go ar-- Go around.

819
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:07,743
Fuck.

820
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:55,958
Come on, Mr. Dover.

821
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,216
Shit.

822
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:20,232
Why are you following me?

823
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,277
Get in the car.

824
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,250
Why are you following me?

825
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,756
Where were you going just now?

826
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,302
I parked at the liquor store.
I have a bottle of liquor.

827
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,388
You're the shit-hot detective.
Work it out.

828
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,683
I actually meant before that.

829
01:20:55,517 --> 01:21:00,147
You were walking in the opposite direction
across the parking lot.

830
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:02,274
Towards Campello Street.

831
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,953
Yeah, well, I haven't had a drink
in nine and a half years.

832
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,790
Figured if I walked around
the parking lot a while...

833
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,542
...by the time they opened
I'd stop wanting it that bad.

834
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:25,422
And then I saw you.
Sort of helped me make up my mind.

835
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:34,973
There's a bag of lye in your basement
that's half empty.

836
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,813
Your wife thinks you've been helping us...

837
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,651
...but we both know that's not true.

838
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,280
I used the lye to bury our dog last year.

839
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:53,826
And "helping the cops" sounds better
than "I've been driving aimlessly in my truck...

840
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,245
...because I don't know
what the fuck else to do."

841
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,747
Is that what you were doing
last Saturday night?

842
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,083
Probably. Am I a suspect?

843
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,337
No, I'm only asking because you
assaulted a man who's now missing.

844
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:11,009
I heard about that. What happened?
Thought you had him under surveillance.

845
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:14,012
I'm gonna assume you're asking me
because you have no idea.

846
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:18,142
- Didn't think it was something I'd get away with.
- It's not.

847
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:21,186
It couldn't be he skipped town
because the asshole is guilty.

848
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:24,690
Couldn't be that. Because that would
mean it would be your fault, right?

849
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,568
Mr. Dover?

850
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,197
- Mr. Dover?
- What?

851
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,992
You need to take care of yourself
and your wife.

852
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,995
That's the best thing you can do right now.

853
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:42,207
That little girl is gonna need you
when she comes home.

854
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:50,799
Kids gone for more than a week
have half as good a chance of being found...

855
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,052
...and after a month, almost none are.
Not alive. All right?

856
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,221
So forgive me for doing everything I can--

857
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,515
You know what?
It hasn't been a fucking week.

858
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,394
- You're right. It's day fucking six! Day six!
- Hasn't been a week.

859
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:06,732
And every day she's wondering why
I'm not there to fucking rescue her!

860
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,610
- All right.
- Do you understand that? Me! Not you!

861
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,070
Not you! But me!

862
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,739
- Every day!
- All right.

863
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:18,827
So forgive me for not going home
to have a good night's rest!

864
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:23,415
Now, why don't you look for my
fucking daughter rather than fighting--?

865
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:26,210
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

866
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,545
- Don't follow me.
- Hey. Hey.

867
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,923
Mr. Dover. Mr. Dover.

868
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,933
Don't think I'd let you get behind
the wheel after you've been drinking, do you?

869
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:44,102
I'm gonna walk. You look for my daughter.

870
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,023
Daddy.

871
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,817
Daddy.

872
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,486
Look, Daddy, we found it.

873
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,743
Anna, where was it?

874
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,772
I'm not Alex.

875
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:40,112
I'm not Alex.

876
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,073
What? What are you saying? What?

877
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,617
- What?
- I'm...

878
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:48,412
I'm not Alex.

879
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:51,957
- What, you're not Alex? What?
- I'm not Alex.

880
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:54,042
Just a--

881
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:57,796
I don't understand. Just talk to me.

882
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:01,383
I waited and he never came.

883
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:05,262
Come on. No more riddles.
Just fucking tell me.

884
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:08,056
He never came. I just...

885
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:12,978
I'll let you go home to your aunt
if you tell me where they are.

886
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:18,483
I just wanted to play.

887
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,277
Don't make me do this to you.

888
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,612
- And he never came.
- What were you doing?

889
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,618
He never came. I just wanted to--

890
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,996
Why are you making me do this?

891
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,766
Help me, God.

892
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:59,232
I'm relying on your almighty power
and your infinite mercies and promises.

893
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:03,612
I hope to obtain pardon for my sins.

894
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,229
Fuck me.

895
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,237
No noise. You shut up.

896
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:48,114
You make any noise,
I'm gonna turn on that tap.

897
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:38,874
Hey, rise and shine.

898
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:46,798
I'm not gonna find two girls here, am I?

899
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:48,633
Fuck you.

900
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,099
What about Alex Jones?

901
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,019
What about him?

902
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:04,149
I came here to drink.
I don't want to drink in front of my wife.

903
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:08,612
Look, my father left me
this building, all right?

904
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,325
You mind giving me a tour?

905
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:29,007
- Why didn't you tell me about this place?
- I didn't think it mattered.

906
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,384
Everything matters.

907
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:39,267
It's all pretty much like this.
I'm gonna renovate soon.

908
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:43,605
Yeah. Not as organized
as your basement, huh?

909
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,903
What's up with all the survivor gear
in there?

910
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:53,323
Pray for the best, prepare for the worst.

911
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:55,200
At least we agree there.

912
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:59,162
Come on, hurry up.

913
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,739
Oh, shit.

914
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,327
Hello?

915
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:46,835
The guy you were looking for was just here.
He saw me watching him and ran.

916
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,336
You get a plate?

917
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:55,385
Yeah.

918
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:59,222
Yeah.

919
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,144
Yeah.

920
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,272
Go home, Mr. Dover.

921
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,718
Hi.

922
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,012
Morning.

923
01:32:49,272 --> 01:32:51,483
Why'd you run away from me
the other night?

924
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:55,820
I've never seen you before.

925
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:58,698
You sure you have the right house?

926
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:02,619
You doing some shopping
at the Value Mall lately?

927
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,622
Yeah. Ahem.

928
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:08,124
Why, is it a crime to shop there?

929
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:11,294
I can't afford to buy suits
from Brooks Brothers.

930
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:18,301
Yeah, I know.

931
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,428
You bought children's clothes.

932
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,640
Did I?

933
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,059
Must've been in a hurry.

934
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:30,730
Mm-hm.

935
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:33,441
Do you have children?

936
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:35,860
No.

937
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:40,907
I don't have...

938
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,618
Have anything--

939
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,539
Come on! Christ!

940
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:56,297
Come here. Come here.

941
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,347
Stay.

942
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:08,309
If you move, I'll put a bullet
through your fucking head.

943
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:30,498
This is 13-40. I need additional unit
for search. 437 Carrol Street.

944
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,418
Possible kidnapping victims
on the premises.

945
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:25,136
Anna? Fucking...

946
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,722
Anna? Joy?

947
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:29,474
Fuck.

948
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:41,861
Fuck.

949
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:25,530
Aah! Fuck!

950
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,990
Ah, fuck.

951
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:28,051
So we've taken photographs of some of
the clothing we found in the suspect's house.

952
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:11,928
Mr. Dover.

953
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,102
Mr. Dover, is your wife here?

954
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,985
She's not coming.

955
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:32,115
If you can't make a positive ID
on these photographs...

956
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:35,076
...I'm gonna need her to come in
and take a look at them.

957
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:43,209
Have a seat.

958
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:57,014
So he confessed?
He said he killed them?

959
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:00,184
We were hoping he was lying, but...

960
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:04,522
We haven't even found
any bodies, Mr. Dover, but...

961
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:11,863
...the Birches positively identified
two pieces of clothing.

962
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:17,702
So I'm gonna need you to tell me
if you recognize anything.

963
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,808
No.

964
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:48,399
Uh...

965
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:54,530
I'm not sure. I don't know.

966
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:56,115
Okay.

967
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,662
No.

968
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:11,380
No--

969
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,443
That's her...

970
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,284
That's her sock.

971
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:56,926
You...

972
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,515
You wasted time.

973
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:10,982
You wasted time following me.

974
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:22,702
You let this happen.

975
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:03,868
Don't talk to them.

976
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:13,169
Eliza told me they're dead.

977
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:18,466
- Is it true?
- No.

978
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:21,302
She said they found their bloody clothes--

979
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:24,889
Don't you dare tell your mother that.
Don't you dare, you understand me?

980
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,808
Now, I need you to listen to me.

981
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:31,687
I need you to stay for a couple of days.
Make sure she does not watch the news.

982
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:34,565
When the paper comes,
throw it the fuck away. Listen to me!

983
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:37,777
We do not give up on your sister!
We do not!

984
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,822
I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna bring
her home. We do not give up.

985
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:44,909
You're gonna bring her home?
She's dead. You can't do anything.

986
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:48,245
You leave me and Mom here while you go out,
getting fucking drunk!

987
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:51,749
- You think I can't smell on you?
- Shut up!

988
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:15,815
How long has this Bob Taylor been working...

989
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:17,733
...on this map?

990
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,111
Three and a half hours.

991
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:23,280
Think this is gonna lead
to the bodies? I sure as shit don't.

992
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:26,117
Do me a favor, captain. Go fuck yourself.

993
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:28,786
We weren't getting anywhere
questioning him.

994
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:35,376
That looks more like a maze than a map.

995
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:37,461
He's got a thing for mazes.

996
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:44,218
I'm going home.
Call me if something happens.

997
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,347
Give me that card, John. The key card.

998
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:41,984
All right, it's done now.

999
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:46,030
Tell me what you're drawing.

1000
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,117
You said you're drawing a map.
That looks like a puzzle.

1001
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,077
You tell me what you're drawing.

1002
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:59,293
Tell me what you're drawing.

1003
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:04,965
- I can't!
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

1004
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:06,842
- Yes, you can.
- Oh, shit!

1005
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:09,386
Yes, you can! Yes, you can!

1006
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:12,640
- Take him! Come on!
- Yes, you can! Yes, he can!

1007
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,602
Oh, shit! Gun! Gun! Gun!

1008
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:18,687
Bob, don't! Put the gun down!

1009
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:22,817
Bob. Bob, put the gun down! Bob.
Bob, no!

1010
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:24,485
No! No, no, no!

1011
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:29,198
Fuck.

1012
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:34,036
Go call a fucking R.A.!

1013
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:38,374
<i>Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1014
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,210
Thy kingdom come...

1015
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:44,463
...thy will be done...

1016
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:47,091
...on earth as it is in heaven.

1017
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:53,013
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

1018
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,433
...as we--

1019
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,861
As we for--

1020
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:30,134
He explain this before he ate the bullet?

1021
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:37,266
I'm sorry.

1022
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:41,979
Fuck your sorry.
Save it for the girls' parents.

1023
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:48,152
I don't know what to do, Alex.

1024
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:51,030
I don't know what to do anymore.

1025
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:55,910
And what's completely fucked up about all
this is I know you know where they are.

1026
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:01,206
I think we're done.

1027
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,049
They're in the maze.

1028
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:15,095
- That's where you'll find them.
- What?

1029
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:17,306
What did you say?

1030
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:22,436
In the maze.

1031
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:28,609
What--? What maze? Where is it?
Where is the maze? Where do I find it?

1032
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:30,277
Alex?

1033
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:34,031
Alex, listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1034
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:36,367
Okay? Just tell me where the maze is.

1035
01:47:37,326 --> 01:47:39,161
Just tell me, man.

1036
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:42,456
Where is the maze?

1037
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:47,962
Come on, tell me.
Just tell me where the maze is, okay?

1038
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,050
Come on, don't fuck with me.
Don't fuck with me now.

1039
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:56,720
Don't fuck with me, goddamn it.
Tell me where they are!

1040
01:47:56,971 --> 01:48:00,474
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

1041
01:48:03,394 --> 01:48:05,062
Something's gonna get to you, man.

1042
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:09,733
Something's gonna get to you!
Something's gonna get to you!

1043
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:33,215
Just a minute!

1044
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:38,429
- Can I help you?
- Morning, ma'am.

1045
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,139
Uh...

1046
01:48:40,305 --> 01:48:41,932
I'm Keller Dover.

1047
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:46,603
My little girl was abducted with a friend.

1048
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:50,399
What do you want?

1049
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:53,068
Uh...

1050
01:48:56,280 --> 01:49:00,034
I guess I haven't thought
this through too good, huh? I...

1051
01:49:00,826 --> 01:49:03,996
I been thinking a lot about
what happened to your nephew.

1052
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,792
And I know I scared him the other day
at the police station, and...

1053
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:14,131
What I'm trying to say is I kind of feel
responsible for him running away.

1054
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:19,470
You wanna come on in?

1055
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:21,180
Yeah.

1056
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:36,153
My husband and I were
very devout at one time.

1057
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:42,159
Spent our summers driving around
in that camper with our son...

1058
01:49:43,035 --> 01:49:45,329
...handing out pamphlets.

1059
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,916
Spreading the good word.

1060
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:54,880
After our son died of cancer...

1061
01:49:55,172 --> 01:49:57,925
...we started seeing things differently.

1062
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:01,178
Adopting Alex helped...

1063
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:04,264
...but we never got over it.

1064
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,975
I'm sorry.

1065
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:12,147
You look very tired.

1066
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:16,568
Yeah, I don't sleep much.

1067
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:19,321
I, uh...

1068
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:24,201
I keep dreaming about being lost in a maze.

1069
01:50:27,788 --> 01:50:29,957
I'm sorry. Heh.

1070
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:32,793
Alex never talks very much...

1071
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,046
...so when people come over here,
I hardly know what to say.

1072
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:37,256
He doesn't talk much?

1073
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:40,717
Well, he talks. Good morning,
good night, that sort of thing.

1074
01:50:40,884 --> 01:50:43,804
Hard to get too much
more than that out of him.

1075
01:50:45,222 --> 01:50:47,391
Had an accident when he was little.

1076
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:51,520
After that he started choosing his words
a little too carefully.

1077
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:55,023
- What--? What kind of accident did he--?
- Oh.

1078
01:50:55,774 --> 01:50:58,235
My husband kept snakes.

1079
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:02,781
It wasn't that bad what happened,
but Alex had a fear of them and...

1080
01:51:03,699 --> 01:51:05,909
That's not my favorite memory.

1081
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:09,663
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

1082
01:51:10,122 --> 01:51:11,582
Oh.

1083
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:17,045
Can I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Dover?

1084
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,178
Oh.

1085
01:51:24,344 --> 01:51:27,764
Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you
would have known about that already.

1086
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:31,393
I say it's better this way.
You know, that awful man...

1087
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:36,648
...he would have spent years on Death Row
just watching TV and getting fat.

1088
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:42,279
Well.

1089
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:45,949
Least I don't have to worry
about losing you to P.S.P.

1090
01:51:52,456 --> 01:51:57,294
When forensics is finished with the guy's
place, we're gonna deploy the cadaver dogs.

1091
01:51:58,253 --> 01:52:01,006
Look, kid, we can't always save the day.

1092
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:05,219
All right? We're just cops. Janitors.

1093
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:09,139
So you lost this one, all right?

1094
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:11,725
Look, you want fulfillment,
you need to find a girl.

1095
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:14,311
You know? Start a family, have some kids.

1096
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:16,605
<i>Let it go.</i>

1097
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:39,855
Right.

1098
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:50,324
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey, it's Rich. We found something.</i>

1099
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:55,245
Guys, let us have a look.

1100
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:03,754
Two kid-sized department store
mannequins, with their heads caved in.

1101
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:08,050
I talked to our lab. They told me the blood
we sampled from the plastic containers?

1102
01:54:08,216 --> 01:54:09,843
Pig's blood.

1103
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:14,765
Let's get this covered up.
It's supposed to snow soon. Hurry up, okay?

1104
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:19,853
It's like he's play-acting. Case in point:

1105
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,689
Except for the items ID'd
by the Dovers and the Birches...

1106
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:25,901
...all the kids' clothes that we found
still had tags on them.

1107
01:54:26,068 --> 01:54:28,445
And that maze book that we found,
he made it.

1108
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:31,281
Photocopies, pictures from this book
we found in the attic.

1109
01:54:31,448 --> 01:54:34,868
- Ex-FBI agent wrote that.
- "Finding the Invisible Man."

1110
01:54:35,035 --> 01:54:39,122
It's about a theoretical suspect he believed
was responsible for a bunch of abductions.

1111
01:54:39,289 --> 01:54:42,959
It's totally discredited,
I guess, but I read some of it.

1112
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:46,463
Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.
He ran away after three weeks.

1113
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:49,883
The captor drugged him on some
sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.

1114
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,552
He never remembered
and they never caught the guy.

1115
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:57,557
Okay, so, he read the book and decided
he was taken by the Invisible Man.

1116
01:54:57,724 --> 01:55:00,769
Now he's doing his best imitation, right?

1117
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:06,942
Yeah, he was doing his best imitation.
He killed himself last night.

1118
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,112
How did he do that?
I thought he was in custody.

1119
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:16,326
Hey.

1120
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:20,622
Taylor drew this. It's a map to the bodies.

1121
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:22,165
It's a map to the bodies.

1122
01:55:22,332 --> 01:55:25,335
We found the same design
on a pendant we pulled off that corpse.

1123
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:27,671
- There's a connection, okay?
- Connection is...

1124
01:55:27,838 --> 01:55:31,341
...that it's the last maze in the book.
It's unsolvable. There's no way out.

1125
01:55:31,508 --> 01:55:35,095
Your corpse is another wannabe,
read the book.

1126
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:37,597
What are you saying to me, Rich? What?

1127
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:39,933
What are you saying, that this guy is a fake?

1128
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,061
You're saying that the girls
are still out there somewhere?

1129
01:55:43,228 --> 01:55:45,147
How did Bob Taylor get those clothes?

1130
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:48,108
How did--? How did the parents...

1131
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:50,861
...positively ID those clothes?

1132
01:55:52,863 --> 01:55:54,781
That I can't reconcile.

1133
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:56,199
You can't reconcile that?

1134
01:55:56,366 --> 01:55:59,494
Just keep knocking on doors,
looking in windows.

1135
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:01,830
Hey, why is that there? Bag that.

1136
01:56:01,997 --> 01:56:04,166
Will do, sir. Right away.

1137
01:57:31,753 --> 01:57:33,213
Yes?

1138
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,760
Yeah, this is she.

1139
01:57:43,014 --> 01:57:44,391
What?

1140
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:48,353
Oh, my God.

1141
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:51,731
Wait. Is she--?

1142
01:57:52,983 --> 01:57:54,651
Ralph! Keller!

1143
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:12,752
Keller! We need to go to the hospital!

1144
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:15,338
They found Joy, but not Anna!
They didn't find Anna!

1145
01:58:15,505 --> 01:58:18,758
Maybe she'll know where Anna is!
Please, we have to go!

1146
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:20,302
Keller!

1147
01:58:23,179 --> 01:58:25,390
Eliza's not picking up.

1148
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:28,059
- You should text her.
- Yeah.

1149
01:58:37,068 --> 01:58:39,529
- Nobody gets beyond this point.
- Don't touch me.

1150
01:58:39,696 --> 01:58:42,157
- Miss! Wait a minute--
- It's okay.

1151
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:44,534
- Nancy.
- Grace.

1152
01:58:44,701 --> 01:58:47,203
They'll find Anna. I know they will.
I know they will.

1153
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:49,372
I know.

1154
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:52,459
- How is she?
- Is she awake?

1155
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,795
Joy, were you far from our street?

1156
01:58:55,962 --> 01:58:59,090
How far from the street were you, Joy? Joy?

1157
01:58:59,257 --> 01:59:01,718
- You can't be doing this.
- How long did it take you--?

1158
01:59:01,885 --> 01:59:03,678
- Let me ask a question!
- Keller!

1159
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:06,723
The detective will be back in just a minute.
You need to wait.

1160
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:09,684
- She's been drugged.
- Joy.

1161
01:59:09,851 --> 01:59:14,648
Sweetheart, just let us
know she's alive, okay?

1162
01:59:15,065 --> 01:59:18,401
Can you just nod your head, baby?
Just nod your head?

1163
01:59:18,568 --> 01:59:23,073
Baby? Can you give us a nod?
Can you nod your head for us, please?

1164
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:24,741
Joy?

1165
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:36,920
Joy.

1166
02:00:08,451 --> 02:00:10,328
You were there.

1167
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:14,541
What? I--? I was where?

1168
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:19,421
- It put tape on our mouths.
- Shh.

1169
02:00:21,005 --> 02:00:23,508
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

1170
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,678
It's okay. It's okay.

1171
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:30,807
Mommy and Daddy are here now,
okay? You're all right.

1172
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:33,226
- Excuse me.
- You're all right now.

1173
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,354
I said nobody's allowed in that room
but her family.

1174
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:38,940
- Hey! Where you going?
- Keller?

1175
02:00:39,107 --> 02:00:41,985
- Hey! Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1176
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:44,696
Hey! Call downstairs. Don't let him go.

1177
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:46,990
Hey! Hey!

1178
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:48,825
Hey!

1179
02:00:50,869 --> 02:00:53,079
Stop that car! Get his truck!

1180
02:00:53,246 --> 02:00:55,206
Stop it! Hey!

1181
02:01:17,896 --> 02:01:20,356
I've got you, you fucker.

1182
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:22,609
I know where you're going.

1183
02:01:23,485 --> 02:01:25,028
I know where you're going.

1184
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:44,440
Hello again.

1185
02:02:44,941 --> 02:02:49,779
Hey. I was hoping you'd
let me do some penance.

1186
02:02:51,155 --> 02:02:55,201
- For what?
- Scaring you the other day at the, uh...

1187
02:02:55,368 --> 02:02:58,454
- At the police station.
- You already apologized for that.

1188
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:02,125
I know, I was just--
You know, I thought maybe you, uh...

1189
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:05,044
You could use some
help around the--

1190
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:08,798
I noticed your door here needs fixing,
so I brought my tools and, uh...

1191
02:03:08,965 --> 02:03:12,552
Oh. I see.

1192
02:03:14,345 --> 02:03:18,516
I burned myself. Feel a little icky today.

1193
02:03:19,976 --> 02:03:23,354
But I'm glad you want to talk some more.

1194
02:03:23,521 --> 02:03:28,693
No need to make excuses.
You come on in and make me a cup of tea.

1195
02:03:38,036 --> 02:03:39,662
Come on in.

1196
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:01,434
I don't want to have to hurt you.

1197
02:04:03,811 --> 02:04:05,855
I know they were here.

1198
02:04:07,732 --> 02:04:10,860
Put your hands on your head
and turn around.

1199
02:04:12,403 --> 02:04:14,030
Do it.

1200
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:19,035
I'm just gonna go.

1201
02:04:19,202 --> 02:04:24,040
Don't touch that bag.
Put your hands on your head.

1202
02:04:28,628 --> 02:04:31,756
Come over here to this counter. Come on.

1203
02:04:41,265 --> 02:04:42,892
Top drawer.

1204
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,395
Open it.

1205
02:04:51,526 --> 02:04:53,194
Mm-hm.

1206
02:04:54,779 --> 02:04:56,489
Put them on.

1207
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:09,252
You don't know me, Mr. Dover.

1208
02:05:09,502 --> 02:05:13,423
But believe me when I tell you,
I won't let you go.

1209
02:05:21,723 --> 02:05:23,599
You don't have to drink all of it.

1210
02:05:24,809 --> 02:05:28,229
About a third should do for a man your size.

1211
02:05:29,772 --> 02:05:32,734
- Something to make you more manageable.
- Forget it.

1212
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:37,447
Drink it, Mr. Dover, or I'll kill you right here in
my kitchen and bring your daughter in here...

1213
02:05:37,613 --> 02:05:40,575
- ...and have her scrub your brains off the floor.
- Where is she?

1214
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:45,288
Drink.

1215
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,540
Just let me see her.

1216
02:05:47,707 --> 02:05:49,459
- You want to see her?
- Yes.

1217
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:52,962
That's your ticket
to your daughter right there.

1218
02:06:03,681 --> 02:06:07,351
Little more, Mr. Dover. Little more.

1219
02:06:13,274 --> 02:06:15,068
Good, isn't it?

1220
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:18,154
That's my darling husband's recipe.

1221
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:27,663
Now go on out back.

1222
02:06:28,164 --> 02:06:30,083
Let me see her.

1223
02:06:35,505 --> 02:06:37,632
Take it out of your pocket.

1224
02:06:40,009 --> 02:06:41,677
Put it in the sink.

1225
02:06:44,347 --> 02:06:46,349
Put it in the disposal.

1226
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:56,859
Put your car keys on the table.

1227
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:02,949
Put your car keys on the table.

1228
02:07:04,909 --> 02:07:06,410
That's right.

1229
02:07:07,203 --> 02:07:11,415
Go over to the Trans-Am over there.
The car over there. Come on, move it.

1230
02:07:11,582 --> 02:07:13,376
Get over there.

1231
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:22,885
The look on your face.

1232
02:07:23,052 --> 02:07:27,890
My husband used to have the very same look
until we took Alex.

1233
02:07:28,057 --> 02:07:30,017
He was the first kid we ever took.

1234
02:07:30,184 --> 02:07:33,896
His name was Jimmy. Or Barry.

1235
02:07:34,063 --> 02:07:36,566
Can't remember. Doubt he can, either.

1236
02:07:36,732 --> 02:07:38,776
So many names.

1237
02:07:38,943 --> 02:07:43,531
Forgot all about Bobby Taylor
until I read about him in the paper.

1238
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:47,743
Get in the driver's seat.

1239
02:07:57,170 --> 02:07:59,589
Open the door and get in the car.

1240
02:08:14,437 --> 02:08:19,358
Making children disappear
is the war we wage with God.

1241
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,070
Makes people lose their faith.

1242
02:08:23,237 --> 02:08:26,115
Turns them into demons like you.

1243
02:08:27,283 --> 02:08:31,078
Had to slow down
since my husband disappeared.

1244
02:08:31,245 --> 02:08:33,331
But I do what I can.

1245
02:08:34,957 --> 02:08:36,709
Start the car.

1246
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:39,295
Start the car.

1247
02:08:44,842 --> 02:08:46,636
Keep trying.

1248
02:08:52,516 --> 02:08:55,311
Back up. Slowly.

1249
02:08:59,315 --> 02:09:02,568
Come on. Back up.

1250
02:09:04,528 --> 02:09:05,988
Come on.

1251
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:11,160
Stop.

1252
02:09:11,327 --> 02:09:12,828
Turn it off.

1253
02:09:13,621 --> 02:09:15,498
Turn it off!

1254
02:09:16,749 --> 02:09:18,251
Get out.

1255
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:29,262
Think you should know.

1256
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:31,847
Alex never laid a hand on those girls.

1257
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:34,558
Just wanted to take them
for a ride in the camper.

1258
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:38,020
I was the one who decided
they should stay.

1259
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:43,025
Take a look.

1260
02:09:44,568 --> 02:09:46,696
Maybe your daughter's under there.

1261
02:09:47,196 --> 02:09:48,948
You never know.

1262
02:09:50,533 --> 02:09:51,993
Anna.

1263
02:09:52,827 --> 02:09:54,328
Anna!

1264
02:09:59,959 --> 02:10:01,043
Anna?

1265
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:04,714
Anna! Anna! Anna!

1266
02:10:05,548 --> 02:10:09,677
I had the girls down there
while the police came poking around.

1267
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:12,221
Should have left them down there.

1268
02:10:13,389 --> 02:10:15,057
I was so lonely without Alex.

1269
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:20,646
- Now get in there.
- What?

1270
02:10:21,147 --> 02:10:23,024
Get in.

1271
02:10:26,235 --> 02:10:29,238
You want me to get in there,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

1272
02:10:29,989 --> 02:10:32,325
I'm not gonna get in there
just because you asked.

1273
02:10:36,412 --> 02:10:37,913
God!

1274
02:10:43,419 --> 02:10:46,630
Go on. Get in there.

1275
02:10:53,929 --> 02:10:55,348
That's right.

1276
02:11:15,117 --> 02:11:17,453
Make yourself a tourniquet.

1277
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:20,414
Just might last 24 hours.

1278
02:11:25,669 --> 02:11:29,799
I'd love for you to still be alive when I dump
your daughter's body down there.

1279
02:11:35,888 --> 02:11:37,973
Wait. No, wait, wait! Wait!

1280
02:11:43,354 --> 02:11:44,897
Oh.

1281
02:12:08,129 --> 02:12:10,965
Hey. I need you to go over to Holly Jones'.

1282
02:12:11,132 --> 02:12:13,551
- She needs to be notified.
- No. I need to find Dover.

1283
02:12:13,717 --> 02:12:16,929
- Come on. You're done with Dover.
- You want me to go to Holly Jones'?

1284
02:12:17,096 --> 02:12:20,141
I want you to go to Holly Jones'
and notify her, please.

1285
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:30,818
Pfft.

1286
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:53,090
Oh, God.

1287
02:13:49,438 --> 02:13:54,068
Almighty God, protect my girl.

1288
02:15:07,099 --> 02:15:08,726
Mrs. Jones?

1289
02:15:20,571 --> 02:15:22,281
Mrs. Jones?

1290
02:16:53,789 --> 02:16:55,124
Show me your hands right now.

1291
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:58,877
Don't move and show me
your fucking hands right now.

1292
02:16:59,378 --> 02:17:02,339
Stop right now!
Show me your fucking hands.

1293
02:17:02,506 --> 02:17:04,633
Do not move and show me your hands.

1294
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:09,388
Make sure they cremate me. I sure as hell
don't want to be buried in some box.

1295
02:17:09,555 --> 02:17:11,598
Both hands! Right now! Right now!

1296
02:17:13,934 --> 02:17:15,352
Fuck!

1297
02:17:26,864 --> 02:17:28,323
Anna.

1298
02:17:28,866 --> 02:17:30,743
Oh, my God.

1299
02:17:51,388 --> 02:17:52,598
Anna.

1300
02:18:08,655 --> 02:18:10,365
Oh, shit.

1301
02:18:27,049 --> 02:18:29,051
Come on. Come on, Anna.

1302
02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:30,385
Anna. Come on.

1303
02:18:34,556 --> 02:18:37,643
Stay with me, Anna. Stay with me, huh?

1304
02:18:38,310 --> 02:18:40,062
Stay with me, Anna.

1305
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:51,657
Stay with me, Anna! It's all right.
It's all right, come on.

1306
02:18:51,824 --> 02:18:53,158
Go, move, move, move!

1307
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:04,586
Don't die. Don't die.

1308
02:19:31,947 --> 02:19:33,532
It's okay. It's okay.

1309
02:19:35,158 --> 02:19:37,369
Honey. You're okay.

1310
02:19:37,536 --> 02:19:39,788
Hey. Hey.

1311
02:19:40,289 --> 02:19:42,457
Hey! Help!

1312
02:19:43,292 --> 02:19:45,252
Help! Help.

1313
02:19:45,419 --> 02:19:48,630
Help! Help!

1314
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:11,778
Um, Detective Loki?

1315
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:16,658
I hope we're not intruding.

1316
02:20:17,826 --> 02:20:18,911
No.

1317
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:25,751
She's doing real good.

1318
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:30,005
She's gonna be up and around
in a few days, aren't you, buddy?

1319
02:20:30,172 --> 02:20:34,343
She just wanted to come and say
thank you and hi to her hero.

1320
02:20:39,514 --> 02:20:40,974
Hello.

1321
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:51,777
Would you mind giving me a minute?

1322
02:20:53,528 --> 02:20:55,572
- Yeah. Say goodbye, Joy.
- Thank you.

1323
02:20:55,739 --> 02:20:58,575
- Bye.
- I'll be out in a minute. Say goodbye, Anna.

1324
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:27,145
She found her whistle?

1325
02:21:28,647 --> 02:21:29,898
No.

1326
02:21:30,065 --> 02:21:32,693
She keeps insisting
that Joy helped her find it...

1327
02:21:32,859 --> 02:21:35,570
...on Thanksgiving before they were taken.

1328
02:21:35,737 --> 02:21:38,448
But I think she's just confused.

1329
02:21:39,449 --> 02:21:40,909
I got her a new one.

1330
02:21:58,301 --> 02:22:00,721
He hasn't contacted me.

1331
02:22:03,807 --> 02:22:05,434
I know you don't...

1332
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:08,520
I know you probably don't believe that,
but he hasn't.

1333
02:22:15,736 --> 02:22:17,779
I believe you.

1334
02:22:25,746 --> 02:22:27,748
Do you think you're gonna find him?

1335
02:22:32,127 --> 02:22:33,462
Yeah.

1336
02:22:34,755 --> 02:22:36,465
And he'll go to jail.

1337
02:22:38,967 --> 02:22:40,469
Probably.

1338
02:22:44,514 --> 02:22:46,058
Anyway.

1339
02:22:47,225 --> 02:22:49,144
Thank you for everything.

1340
02:22:52,022 --> 02:22:54,191
Oh, God.

1341
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,496
I miss him.

1342
02:23:11,333 --> 02:23:15,545
He-- He did what he had to do
to find Anna...

1343
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:17,422
...and I thank God for that.

1344
02:23:27,641 --> 02:23:29,643
He's a good man.

1345
02:23:38,777 --> 02:23:40,195
Bye.

1346
02:24:04,469 --> 02:24:06,555
That's it. Let's pack it up.

1347
02:24:14,729 --> 02:24:17,899
- You all done for the night?
- Yeah, the ground's frozen solid.

1348
02:24:18,066 --> 02:24:21,236
It's gonna take weeks to excavate
the entire property.

1349
02:24:21,403 --> 02:24:24,197
Just found some dead snakes and shit.

1350
02:24:26,158 --> 02:24:29,077
Pray for the best,
prepare for the worst, yeah?

1351
02:24:31,121 --> 02:24:32,539
Night.

1352
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:36,877
Night.

1353
02:24:37,919 --> 02:24:39,254
Shut her down.

1354
02:24:39,421 --> 02:24:41,089
Yeah, I got it.
